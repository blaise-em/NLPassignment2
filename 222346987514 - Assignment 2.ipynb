       "'  Randal Pinkett’s first day in the Trump Organization was one he would never forget. Summoned to the offices in Trump Tower, the billionaire’s garish midtown skyscraper, Pinkett entered the room as Trump thumbed through a stack of the day’s newspapers and magazines. It was 2005, and having just won season four of The Apprentice, the only African American to do so in the show’s history, Pinkett expected Trump’s attention. But as the two spoke about his hard-won contract with the company, it was clear Trump really only cared about one thing: himself. He broke off from the conversation intermittently, pulling a paper from the pile, carefully scanning each page with a yellow Post-It note stuck to it and disregarding the rest – an aide had already combed through the publications to mark out every article that mentioned the boss. This was his morning routine. “I think that just speaks volumes,” Pinkett said in an interview. “Donald loves Donald. “His identity is wrapped around being a winner. If you challenge him, or if he’s put into a losing position, now you begin to take Donald out of his comfort zone.” In interviews with 12 former employees of Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination and now one of the most controversial figures in modern American politics, none disagreed with Pinkett’s frank assessment of his former boss’s inflated sense of self. “I don’t think it’s possible to quantify the size of his ego,” said Barbara Res, a former Trump Organization executive vice-president throughout the 1980s. “It’s too big.” While Trump’s self-regard is well established, these accounts, some from former staff members who have not spoken about their time in the company since Trump announced his candidacy, give a more detailed insight into the dynamics of Trump’s organisational and management style, which serve perhaps as a portentous insight into how he could operate in the White House.   A consensus emerged of a businessman obsessed with minute detail, prone to micromanagement, who takes little interest in the diversity of his executives or the welfare of lower-level employees. Some said Trump lacks the temperament to deal with setbacks and becomes instantly impatient with those who do not support or agree with him, while remaining resolutely loyal to those who do. Others described their former boss as a workaholic with few true friends, a man sometimes awkward in company outside the workplace. Provided with a list of detailed claims made by interviewees in this article, Trump told the Guardian in a statement that they were “allegations by disgruntled and disloyal former employees” that were “totally false”.  ‘Donald ... did everything’  Trump considered no time of day off limits to call one his closest advisers, Blanche Sprague – who served as a high-powered executive and enforcer until 1990 and described herself as “sort of the meanest one in the company”. Although ostensibly an executive overseeing construction projects, Sprague, now 67, described her role as often “like a nanny”, dealing with Trump’s direct requests and petty grievances. “He couldn’t stand to see anything look bad,” Sprague recalled. “He used to call me up at night and say: ‘Did you know that there’s a soda bottle in front of Trump Plaza?’ and I would have to make sure it was picked up right away because he would drive past again to see that it was gone. “Sometimes it didn’t do much for your ego but at least you got it done.”    Trump with Blanche Sprague, who describes herself as ‘like a nanny’ to the businessman. Photograph: Allan Tannenbaum/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty  On another occasion, following the publication of Trump’s bestselling autobiography and business guide The Art of The Deal in 1987, Sprague recalled accompanying her boss to a book signing in Palm Beach, Florida, where her task was to make sure that he did not run out of his favourite marker pen – which was a particular shade of robin’s egg blue. She stood at his side all evening holding the pens and replenishing his supply. And yet Sprague remained in awe of her former boss (despite an acrimonious departure which resulted in her suing the company), recalling the times his obsessive attention to detail uncovered the misalignment of terraces during the construction of Trump Tower, or drove the renovation of Central Park’s ice rink in 1981. “Donald, in the end, did everything … No matter how smart you might be, it was Donald,” she said. Another of Trump’s inner circle from this period, former executive vice president for real estate Louise Sunshine, argued it was this obsession with detail in construction that has driven one of Trump’s most controversial policy positions in 2016: the pledge to build a large wall across the US border with Mexico. “I think building a wall is something he can really relate to. He’s built so many that I think he can really visualize it. I don’t think he thinks of it as a barrier; I think he thinks of it as some sort of construction,” Sunshine, a registered Democrat, said. She added that “since day one”, Trump’s first lesson to her had been “bad publicity is better than no publicity at all”. The micromanagement has seemingly continued throughout his life. Justin Goldberg, a former project director who managed the renovation of a property on Wall Street in 1995, recalled how Trump would personally call the painting company to negotiate a deal downwards after it had already been signed, and would point to the smallest details throughout the renovation. Aaron Sigmond, the former editorial director of the widely lampooned and now defunct Trump Magazine, recalled how Trump would personally select the front cover of every edition of the quarterly publication. Sigmond unabashedly referred to the magazine as “wealth porn” and was keen to point out that the first decision he made when he got the job in 2005 was to run a photo of Trump or a member of his family on every front page. Trump would also return a magazine mock-up with scribbled suggestions on most pages – no longer in robin’s egg blue, but black sharpie marker.  ‘He’s a big-picture guy’  This obsession with detail was accompanied by a relentless work ethic. Most interviewees estimated Trump wakes around 5am, starting his first meetings two hours later, taking sips of caffeinated drinks throughout the day to keep going. “He somehow requires far less sleep than I do,” said Roger Stone, Trump’s longtime friend and political adviser who spectacularly quit the campaign trail after a public dispute with the candidate in August last year. “Even in the winter time, when he goes to Florida for the weekend, instead of flying back on Monday morning, he flies back on Sunday night so he can be at his desk on Monday morning. And he doesn’t leave on Thursday, he leaves Friday night, after working a full day.” Louise Sunshine said: “He is a very strategic, methodical person. Nothing goes by him. He could be giving a speech in Ohio and he’ll know what’s going on in the right, what’s going on in the left, what’s going on beyond what’s going on behind. “He has 360-degree sensory engagement.” Stone compares him to two previous Republican presidents. “Well, like Reagan, he’s a showman,” he says. “He’s a performer.”    Roger Stone, pictured at his office in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Photograph: Miami Herald/MCT via Getty Images  But he rejects the observation that Trump micromanages: “I think that he is someone who will gather the finest minds, he will extract as much information as he can, he will ask hard questions and he’ll make decisions. It’s kind of the Eisenhower model. He doesn’t need to know the name of every sub-sect of Islamic rebels in the African continent. “He doesn’t need to know all that. He just needs to know the big picture. Like Ronald Reagan, he’s a big picture guy.” Trump consistently argues that he only hires the best people, and when in office his inner circle will consist of “people you’ve never heard of that are better than all of them”. But one source with intimate knowledge of Trump’s working practice, who declined to be named, disagreed entirely. “He says he’s going to get the best people around. But he doesn’t do that – he never has,” said the source. “Because he doesn’t listen to them, and then they leave. And if anybody is ever credited with doing anything good, he gets rid of them because he hates when anybody else gets credit.” Pinkett, too, was struck by the groupthink of Trump’s inner circle in 2005. “They tend not just to look like him but also think like him,” he said. “So it kind of reinforces his way of thinking.” Both Res and Pinkett – who have gone on to forge high-powered careers outside of the Trump Organization – said they had not heard from Trump in years following incidents they believed may have been branded acts of disloyalty. (Pinkett called Trump in 2012 to tell him he found his birther campaign against Barack Obama offensive, and Res wrote a book about her time in the organization she believed her former boss did not like; she was cold-shouldered at an event after it was published.) Res was present in the organization when Trump hit rock bottom. It was the early 1990s, when serious questions were first asked about Trump’s true worth, when an affair with Marla Maples ended his first marriage, and when his investments in Atlantic City casinos nosedived. “At the exact time it was happening, he blamed it on other people,” Res recalled. He blamed the casino managers, and, according to Res, argued he was “too involved with seeing other women and not paying enough attention”. “He said that. I’m not making that up,” Res added.  Diversity issues  Pinkett spent a year inside the organization tasked with overseeing a $100m renovation to Trump-branded casinos and hotels in Atlantic City. The job itself ran relatively smoothly, but one thing about the company always struck him: “I don’t think I ever sat in a room with another person of color,” he said. Sprague, too, struggled to remember the names of any senior minority managers in the company during her tenure. “We certainly had a wonderful man who ... was Indian,” she said. “We had secretaries who were black, [too].” Pinkett said he was sometimes called upon to be the public face of Trump’s business when he needed to engage minority communities. In 2006, when the organization attempted (and failed) to build a casino in a majority African American neighbourhood in northern Philadelphia, Pinkett claimed he was asked to canvass for the company in the community, despite his own reservations, and was “threatened” by management when he voiced discontent. “They said if I didn’t continue my support then there may be ramifications,” Pinkett said.    Trump ‘generally’ pays women more than men, says Roger Stone. Photograph: George Lange  But Trump’s staunchest supporters point to his record of historically employing women in senior roles. Roger Stone argued Trump had “far, far more women in positions of responsibility, and generally speaking the women are paid more than men”. Like many of the dozens of former employees who declined requests for interviews with the Guardian, Stone cited a non-disclosure agreement with Trump when pressed on specifics. Res, who was Trump’s executive vice-president for construction until 1991, acknowledged that he treated men and women equally in the boardroom. But she added: “I’ve come to the conclusion that he probably liked having women around him because he felt better than them in some way or another. Maybe innately he felt better – they were maybe less of a competition.”  Just a ‘regular guy’?  No one, except for Stone, immediately identified Donald Trump as their friend. He never socialised with employees and, according to some, rarely engaged with anyone outside of work, organized functions or family life. “His socializing was all business,” said Res, who recalled that Trump would meet every Friday evening for dinner with his father Fred Trump, the Brooklyn-based real estate developer who founded the company Donald would inherit. She described the elder Trump as “very, very difficult … loud and boisterous” and someone Trump was eager to impress. “He loved and respected his father,” said Sprague. “You could be walking on a wire with nothing below you, with him [Donald] holding the other end of the wire. If his father walked into the room, he’d drop it to go say hello.” Justin Goldberg was project manager on 40 Wall Street, the art deco New York skyscraper bought by Trump in 1995, and was given a job in the Trump Organization through his father, Jay Goldberg, Trump’s long-serving and trusted attorney. He recalled one awkward moment away from work sometime in the mid-nineties. When Trump had slept over at the family’s residence in upstate New York, Goldberg’s mother prepared breakfast for him in the morning and mistakenly poured salt instead of sugar all over their guest’s cornflakes. Trump, trying to mind his manners, ate the whole salty, soggy breakfast. “I thought that was pretty impressive,” said Goldberg. Some former employees argued that despite Trump’s impressive wealth, he remained a “regular guy”.    Alma Zamarin, 55, a part-time server at the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. Photograph: Courtesy of Alam Zamarin  “He’s a billionaire without being elite,” said Stone, recalling the 1988 Republican convention in New Orleans, where he claimed that he and Trump had decided against a black tie dinner with George H W Bush and chosen instead to seek out the best burgers in town. “See if you can commandeer a limo, and let’s go there instead,” Trump told Stone. Others dismissed this characterisation as spin. Louise Sunshine recalled Trump’s move away from his father’s empire in Brooklyn and into Manhattan in the mid-70s. The two would drive around the lower end of the city in a limousine, picking out properties they wanted to acquire. Even then, Trump would discuss his dream of purchasing the Mar-a-lago beach resort in Florida. He eventually bought it in 1985, and turned it into a private members’ club with a $100,000 joining fee. Alma Zamarin, the only current Trump employee to talk to the Guardian, had the most forthright view of this characterisation. The 55-year-old earns $9.75 an hour with no benefits or health insurance, as a part time server in the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. She has worked there for five years, hoping for a staff contract that has yet to materialise, and struggles to pay bills and feed her retired husband and two children. Her union estimates that Trump pays his hotel workers in Las Vegas, on average, $3.33 less per hour than the average wages on the Las Vegas strip. “He doesn’t care about me,” Zamarin said. “I think he just cares about his business, how much money he’s making.”     Randal Pinkett strode into the salmon-coloured marble atrium of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, stepped into a lift that glided up to the 26th floor and entered an office that, along with a vista of wintry Manhattan, was lined with signed memorabilia and magazine covers bearing the face of Donald John Trump. The first and only African American winner of the reality TV show The Apprentice had arrived for his first day at work. But when he walked in, Pinkett recalls, Trump was methodically working through a foot-high stack of magazines and newspapers on his desk. Each item in the stack had a Post-it note; and Trump took an item off the top of the stack, put it on his desk and opened it at the Post-it note. He read the relevant article then put it to the side. Disconcertingly, this ritual continued throughout their half-hour meeting in early 2006. “So I’m wondering,” Pinkett says, “is this guy reading current trends in real estate, is he reading stock market coverage, is he reading about global business? I lean over as we’re talking and I realise everything he’s looking at is an article about himself. In fact at several points in the conversation Donald got so excited about what he was reading about himself that he would pick up the magazine and hold it up to me and say, ‘Look Randal, do you see that The Apprentice was number one in the ratings last week, isn’t that great?’ “Apparently somebody’s job responsibility is to find all this stuff and to organise it for him to read. I can only conclude that Donald loves reading about Donald.” Donald loves reading about Donald. He has, according to many who know him, study him or write about him, made Donald his life’s work. Now he is seeking to perfect his masterpiece. His Jovian self-belief helped him sweep aside 16 rivals, including governors and senators, to become the first non-politician in decades to win a major party’s nomination for president. Barring a spectacular rebellion, the billionaire tycoon’s coronation will take place next week at the Republican convention in Cleveland ahead of what could be the ugliest election fight ever against Hillary Clinton. How Donald Trump got to this once unthinkable, preposterous height is a story of immigrant ancestors working hard and making good, of hustling and hucksterism, of show business and showmanship, of success and celebrity, of bending the truth and branding the enemy, of a particular interpretation of “the pursuit of happiness”. It is also a story of monumental ego undented by self-doubt. Trump’s swagger, eager to establish himself as the alpha male in the room, is said to be matched only by his lack of introspection. “He is a world-class narcissist,” says David Cay Johnston, author of the upcoming The Making of Donald Trump, who estimates his worth at no more than $1bn. “Donald believes that he is this incredibly great person and if you don’t recognise that, you’re a loser.” Once, boasting of his golfing prowess, Trump asked journalists: “Do I hit it long? Is Trump strong?” It would be no great surprise if, should he become president, he ordered his face carved into Mount Rushmore alongside Washington, Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt and Lincoln.

Mirrors line the backdrop of the Trump Grill at Trump Tower, creating the illusion that it is double its actual size, while the lobby is full of shiny, reflective surfaces. Mirrors decorate the gaudy, gilded, Versailles-style ballrooms of Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s would-be winter White House in Florida. His former butler there, Anthony Senecal, 84, says: “He’s really got good taste in mirrors.” But not, it seems, a rearview mirror. Mark Singer, who profiled Trump for the New Yorker in 1997, writes in a new book, Trump & Me:  “OK,” I say. “You’re basically alone. Your wife is still asleep” – he was then married, but not for much longer, to his second wife, Marla Maples – “you’re in the bathroom shaving and you see yourself in the mirror. What are you thinking?”   From Trump, a look of incomprehension.   Me: “I mean, are you looking at yourself and thinking, ‘Wow. I’m Donald Trump’?”   Trump remains puzzled.   Me: “OK, I guess I’m asking, do you consider yourself ideal company?”   (At the time, I deemed Trump’s reply unprintable. But that was then.)   Trump: “You really want to know what I consider ideal company?”   Me: “Yes.”   Trump: “A total piece of ass.”  Singer’s profile determined that Trump does not have an interior life. He “had aspired to and achieved the ultimate luxury”, it concluded, “an existence unmolested by the rumbling of a soul”. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Trump was probably best known to millions as the presenter of the American version of The Apprentice when, last June, he launched his wildly improbable presidential campaign at Trump Tower. After a now famous descent on an escalator, the property developer delivered a speech in which he said of Mexican immigrants: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” Poison was introduced to the American body politic. It contained two key ingredients of the Trump philosophy: the scapegoating of immigrants and what he describes as “truthful hyperbole” which, he claims, is an innocent form of exaggeration and very effective form of promotion. Or to put it another way, “truthiness”, as defined by TV satirist Stephen Colbert – truth that comes from the gut rather than facts. These two ingredients are, in fact, baked into the Trump family history, where they stretched the truth about their own immigrant story to improve their prospects. His German grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was 16 when he arrived on a boat in lower Manhattan with a solitary suitcase in 1885. According to biographer Gwenda Blair, he learned English, became a naturalised US citizen, changed the spelling of his name to Frederick and made his way to Seattle to make his fortune – in the red-light district. He leased a tiny restaurant named the Poodle Dog, which had a kitchen and a bar and advertised “private rooms for ladies”.  Blair says: “I began to look at Trump’s father and got a little bit of a notion of his grandfather and thought, wow, this is really a dynasty. This whole three-generation century of capitalism: they so embody that. The immigrants, the nose for the market, the getting it, that’s what counts, the salesman, the incredible work ethic. They’re all real strivers, really hard workers. Never back down, never give way, always follow success.”    Donald Trump with his mother, Mary, and father, Fred. Photograph: Zuma Press, Inc/Alamy Stock Photo  Frederick Trump moved the family to Queens, New York, opened an office and bought some properties, but was killed by the Spanish flu epidemic in 1918. The business was inherited by his 12-year-old son, Fred, who survived the Great Depression and, Blair writes, told a “flat-out lie” by pretending to be a prosperous estate agent executive. He began to build an empire as a property developer and by the late 1920s was selling houses in Queens for nearly $4,000 each. He walked construction sites after hours picking up nails and putting them back into barrels to be reused. Fred claimed to be of Swedish, not German, descent because of anti-German sentiment in the US between the world wars. Until 1990, including in his 1987 best-seller, The Art of the Deal, Donald Trump himself claimed Swedish, not German, ancestry, even though his German grandmother lived across the street from the family until her death. It was an intergenerational white lie that arguably speaks volumes about Trump’s life and career of truthiness. In 1936 Fred Trump married Mary MacLeod, herself an immigrant from Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides, once described by Donald Trump as “serious Scotland”. They settled in Jamaica Estates, a secluded suburb in Queens with Tudor revival houses and English street names such as Avon, Chelsea, Croydon, Henley, Kent and Somerset. The Trumps’ first, relatively modest, home was on Wareham Place and is currently up for sale. A Muslim family lives two doors away and the community is now middle class and cosmopolitan.   Joseph Charles, 66, a languages professor born in Haiti, says: “I love this neighbourhood. This is the United Nations here. I don’t see anyone on this block voting for Trump, to tell the truth. I don’t like what he stands for and what he’s been saying about different ethnic groups. He has an immigrant background like everyone else so I don’t understand where he’s coming from. After a black president, he must be the ‘great white hope’.” The Trump family’s upward mobility is unmissable in their second abode, where Donald – born in June 1946 – and his four siblings spent most of their childhood, which is on a parallel street and an altogether grander affair with 23 rooms. Seventeen brick steps lead up a hill to the entrance, framed by a colonial-style portico, stained-glass crest and six white Doric columns. Neighbours dub it the “Gone with the Wind mansion”. There wasn’t much point in people in the area trying to keep up with the Trumps. They had Cadillac Convertibles parked in the driveway, with licence plates FT and FT1, and a swimming pool, though not many books. Mark Golding, a close childhood friend of Trump from ages six to 13, recalls being driven there by the family chauffeur. “It had a basement that had this great electric train set-up that I was really envious of Donny for having,” says Golding, 69, now a lawyer in Portland, Oregon. “There were four or five trains and they would go all around and pass each other, one would go up a bridge and down. It was the most amazing train set you’ve ever seen.” Golding, the son of a physician, would sometimes sleep over at the Trump house and, on Saturday mornings, the boys watched children’s TV shows such as Andy’s Gang, and Rin Tin Tin. “I remember that he had a colour TV at a time before we even got our first TV. Colour TV at that time was really pretty awful but I remember thinking wow, that’s pretty amazing. They had a cook and a chauffeur and that was a bit more than we had, and my parents were not poor by any means.” Trump was the tallest boy in school and Golding was second tallest, he recalls. “He was a good guy, at least to me. Some of the kids thought he was a little bit of a bully but I always got on pretty well with Donny. I don’t have specific memories of him ever bullying anybody else. At that time he was never a great student and actually didn’t get along all that well with most of the teachers.” Trump’s father was somewhat formal and strict, a quiet conservative and friend and donor to Barry Goldwater’s doomed 1964 campaign for president. His mother was sophisticated and impeccably dressed. In The Art of the Deal, Trump remembered his mother “being enthralled by the pomp and circumstance” of watching Queen Elizabeth’s coronation on TV. “She always had a flair for the dramatic and grand,” he wrote. “She was a very traditional housewife, but she also had a sense of the world beyond her.” On Sundays the family drove to Manhattan to worship at Marble Collegiate church, which would later host Trump’s wedding and his parents’ funerals. The head pastor was Norman Vincent Peale, dubbed “God’s salesman” and author of the tremendously influential bestseller The Power Of Positive Thinking.     Donald and Ivana Trump.

Never permit it to fade. Your mind will seek to develop the picture … Do not build up obstacles in your imagination.” Blair says: “I think that’s what Trump has done. Everything is a success. I think we’ve seen that over the last year and occasionally marvelled at it. Wow, this guy is good at that! He has harnessed a lot of things, like Twitter, to assist him in doing that. He was like that from the start but he’s good at figuring out how to adapt.” Indeed, the influence of The Power Of Positive Thinking on Trump and his election campaign is not to be underestimated. He told the Iowa Family Leadership Summit last year: “I still remember [Peale’s] sermons. You could listen to him all day long. And when you left the church, you were disappointed it was over. He was the greatest guy.” But abruptly, the 13-year-old was yanked out of this serene life and packed off to the New York Military Academy (NYMA), a private boarding school. Blair, who interviewed him extensively, explains: “The story he tells is that he and another kid snuck into Manhattan on the subway and got switchblades, evidently with nothing bad in mind but they seemed cool, and dad sent him off to military school. Off he went and apparently just loved it.” Far from breaking him, military academy was the making of Trump. He thrived on the opportunity for competition over everything from tidying his room to shining his shoes and climbed the ranks. Cadets underwent basic military training (each was assigned an M1 rifle and learned how to break it down), studied an academic curriculum (Trump’s interest ended at geometry) and played sport (Trump excelled at baseball and basketball). Contemporaries recall that the academy had its share of bullying, including physical abuse, but that Trump was never involved as either perpetrator or victim. The young cadets were living in the shadow of the cold war and endured the uncertainty of the Cuban missile crisis, then the assassination of President John F Kennedy in 1963. Peter Ticktin, 70, now a lawyer in Boca Raton, Florida, says: “It had a big effect on all of us. We were all in shock. Everyone cried” – including Trump. Ticktin was a platoon sergeant while Trump, two years his senior, was a company captain. “He was self-confident, maybe a little smug. I wouldn’t go so far as to say arrogant because he was extremely approachable. There was no reason not to like Donald Trump. He was a good person and I think he still is. The same as he’s still tying his tie the same way [a Windsor knot], our honour code of not to lie, cheat or steal is still in him. “I don’t think we had one guy out of 99 who would have had a bad word to say about Donald Trump.” Another NYMA contemporary, Mike Pitkow, 67, a resident of Hilltown Township in Pennsylvania, adds: “There were many student officers who were quite egotistical and power hungry and Donald was not like that. I wouldn’t say he was modest but he had a sense of purpose: he seemed like he knew he was destined for something where he didn’t have to exude any power plays or ego or whatever. He was a decent and, I’d say, a nice guy.” Trump went on to Fordham University, then the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating with a degree in economics in 1968. He helped manage his father’s portfolio of residential housing projects for the middle class in Brooklyn and Queens and became favourite to succeed him after his elder brother, lacking the killer instinct that their father sought, became a pilot. His brother died at 43 due to alcoholism, a tragedy that Trump said led him to eschew alcohol, cigarettes and drugs all his life.

Photograph: AP  Trump made the most of his head start and, with a ferocious work ethic – he rises around 5am each day – set about building an empire. He crossed the East river to Manhattan, a much bigger and more lucrative stage, transforming the rundown Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt and erecting the 68-story Trump Tower, where a portrait of Fred, who died in 1999, still overlooks a bar. Trump properties rose across America and around the world. Paul Willen, an architect who worked with him on the Grand Hyatt project, remembers a rare occasion when Trump was forced to back down over his plan for a vast complex, including the world’s tallest building, at a disused railway yard on Manhattan’s upper west side. “As a practical matter, once he had made his decision to build our scheme instead of his, I can’t say he was an unreasonable client,” Willen says. “Turning around the way he did, I had a certain admiration for his ability to do it quickly, efficiently, without any fuss.” Willen, 87, adds: “He was overbearing and very imperious and lording it over us but in the final analysis he would listen to us and he had to. He was building real buildings and he had to acknowledge us as architects and engineers and construction people and he was reasonable.” Trump, who favours hand-sewn suits from Italian menswear specialist Brioni, carved out a reputation as an audacious deal maker and master marketer. In his world, everything was the biggest, best and most beautiful because everything he touched would turn to gold. Trump also opened hotels and casinos, a venture that led to four bankruptcy filings, though he has never declared personal bankruptcy. The slump in his fortunes at the end of the greed-is-good 1980s coincided with the collapse of his marriage to Ivana, his wife of 14 years, following an affair with former beauty queen Maples.

Photograph: Leif Skoogfors/Corbis via Getty Images  Trump was forced to sell buildings, a Boeing 727 and his yacht, the Trump Princess, not that he was ever much of a sailor. But even at this personal and professional nadir, it seems, his self-belief was unshaken. Roger Stone, 63, a political consultant and friend since meeting Trump in 1979, claims: “I don’t think he ever lost faith in himself because he is the greatest negotiator that ever lived and, at a certain juncture, he figured out that he was worth more to the banks alive than he was dead, so if they took him down, they were going down with him and therefore he was able to negotiate incredible deals which not only saved his company but allowed him to rebuild from scratch. “When it comes to negotiation, he has got ice water in his veins … He’s a very tough negotiator. He leaves nothing on the table. I would not have wanted to be the banks because even though he owed them money, he had them by the throat.” Trump’s recovery in the 1990s – inevitably the cue for another book, The Art of the Comeback – included forays into the entertainment business and he took ownership of the Miss Universe, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants. But it was in 2003 that Trump’s celebrity gained liftoff with The Apprentice, in which contestants competed for a shot at a management job within his organisation. He claimed in a financial disclosure form that he was paid a total of $213m by NBC. For years the equation of Trump = success was pumped into millions of homes. Blair notes: “It gave him 10 years of being in front of the American public being the boss, being CEO, hiring people, famously firing people, being the guy who can fix it, the one who knows everything, being the big authoritarian patriarchal guy. I think that has imprinted on a lot of people, that they ‘trust’ him, that that makes him ‘trustworthy’. That combined with the reality TV phenomenon in which it became acceptable to have something that wasn’t really true. It legitimised a kind of a not-quite-true thing and shifted our idea of what’s an acceptable version of reality.” Pinkett, 45, who won The Apprentice in 2005, agrees. “Reality TV, among other factors, has created this hyper-celebrity culture in America that we’re all now immersed in,” he says. “Celebrity has become its own form of capital and Donald is one of the chief beneficiaries of that cultural phenomenon of celebrity translating into capital. He went from a successful entrepreneur to a media personality and he is now cashing in on that celebrity capital.”    Donald Trump and Apprentice winner Randal Pinkett at Trump Tower. Photograph: Bennett Raglin/WireImage  Now chairman and chief executive of a management, technology and policy consulting firm, Pinkett, from Somerset, New Jersey, continues: “I believe Donald is a very insecure man. Only somebody who is insecure, given Donald’s accomplishments and success and fame and wealth, feels the need to fire back harder than people fire at him and do it in a derogatory, demeaning way. “About two years ago somebody accused Donald of being a racist and Donald’s response to the racism claim was, ‘I hired Randal Pinkett as my apprentice and he has done an outstanding job, so how could I be a racist?’ Two months ago, when I held a press conference stating that I don’t think Donald is fit to be president, Donald’s response is: ‘Randal’s a failure and he did a terrible job for me.’ That’s classic Donald.” * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Trump Tower, located beside 178-year-old luxury jewelry store Tiffany & Co, throbs with activity in midtown Manhattan. On a recent weekday families in T-shirts and shorts milled around the Trump Bar, Trump Grill – where the menu includes Trump Scotch, a selection from the Trump Winery, a Trump Tower steak sandwich and Trump’s homemade ice cream – Trump Cafe, Trump’s Ice Cream Parlor and Trump Store, which sells his books, “Make America great again” baseball caps, “Success by Trump” deodorant sticks, “Donald J Trump signature collection” ties, Trump National Golf Club baseball caps and Trump Tower jelly beans and sour beans. The goods are posh but unpretentious, American but not artisanal, a world away from Brooklyn’s hipsters. A recent photo showed Trump on his private jet eating a McDonald’s Big Mac, fries and Diet Coke. Supporters say this shows his authenticity. Stone, who has wanted him to run for the White House since 1988, recalls the Republican national convention that year. “He was invited to a private black-tie dinner with then Vice-President George H W Bush and his running mate then Senator Dan Quayle. He looked at the engraved invitation which had been delivered by hand to his hotel suite and he said to me, ‘Call down to the desk and find out who has the best cheeseburger in town. Let’s stick this and go out for a burger.’ Trump could not be accused of being an elitist, highbrow, patrician snob. Unlike Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and Bernie Sanders, he has not been spotted at the hit Broadway musical Hamilton. His desert island discs would, friends say, probably include Paul Anka, Tony Bennett and Elton John. Favourite movies include Pulp Fiction, Zulu and Sunset Boulevard, in which ageing actress Norma Desmond declares with Trumpian conviction: “I am big! It’s the pictures that got small.” In his New Yorker profile, Singer writes of Trump’s viewing habits during a flight to Mar-a-Lago. “He’d brought along Michael, a recent release, but 20 minutes after popping it into the VCR he got bored and switched to an old favorite, a Jean Claude Van Damme slugfest called Bloodsport, which he pronounced ‘an incredible, fantastic movie’. “By assigning to his son the task of fast-forwarding through all the plot exposition – Trump’s goal being ‘to get this two-hour movie down to 45 minutes’ – he eliminated any lulls between the nose hammering, kidney tenderizing, and shin whacking. When a beefy bad guy who was about to squish a normal-sized good guy received a crippling blow to the scrotum, I laughed. ‘Admit it, you’re laughing!’ Trump shouted. ‘You want to write that Donald Trump was loving this ridiculous Jean Claude Van Damme movie, but are you willing to put in there that you were loving it, too?’    Donald Trump arrives at a press event where he announced his candidacy for the presidency at Trump Tower on 16 June 2015. Photograph: Christopher Gregory/Getty Images  In the nine years since, Singer has seen nothing to alter his view of Trump as unburdened by a hinterland. “People talk about a private Trump and a public Trump,” he says in his Manhattan apartment. “I’m not so convinced because I’ve seen both and the bombast is there, the obvious extreme self-involvement has always been there. He doesn’t have a sense of irony. He’s a terrible listener but that’s a characteristic of narcissistic people. They’re not engaged with anybody else’s issues.” Singer’s New Yorker colleague writer Ken Auletta, 74, tells a character-defining story. Auletta, whose father was a nodding acquaintance of Trump’s father at a restaurant where each often had lunch, bumped into Trump years later at a New York Knicks basketball game. “He came over to me and he said, ‘Hey, Kenny!’ I don’t know anyone who calls me Kenny. He says, ‘Hey Kenny, how’s your pop?’ I said, ‘Well, actually he died.’ ‘Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.’ “So the next year at a Knicks game I see him and he says, ‘Kenny, how’s your pop?’ So I said, ‘Well, actually he died.’ ‘Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.’ The third year I see him, he says, ‘Hey Kenny, how’s your pop?’ I glared at him and I paused for a second and then I said, ‘My dad’s the same,’ and I walked away.”    Eric, Donald and Ivanka Trump listen to their father Donald at the Grand Opening of Trump Turnberry last month. Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian  Trump himself is a father and grandfather. He divorced Maples in 1999 and married Melania Knauss, a Slovenian model, in 2005. He has five children from three marriages. The offspring from his first – Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric – now help run the Trump Organisation and are playing an ever-expanding role in the election campaign. Stone, speaking from Miami Beach says: “I don’t think anybody would deny that he has a healthy ego but what he’s really into is his family. He’s extraordinarily proud of his family and proud of the role they’re taking in the business.” Stone, who has given many speeches on Trump’s behalf, agrees there is little room for self-reflection. “I don’t think he has a lot of time for psychobabble. Like Nixon and Reagan, both of whom I worked for, he’s not terribly introspective. He’s more interested in the next fight, the next battle.” The Trump persona appears to have devoured the man who created it. But does the great big beautiful winner, aiming to become the oldest US president in history, not shiver just a little when he contemplates death? “No,” replies Senecal, who butlered for him for nearly three decades. “He figures he’s going to live forever.” Pause. “And he probably will.”  \\nThe comment came toward the end of an interview longtime gossip columnist Liz Smith conducted with Trump in June of that year—more than a decade before his current, shockingly successful presidential campaign, sandwiched between his first season of The Apprentice of reality television and the third of his casinos’ four corporate bankruptcy filings.\\nBuffed-up, puff-piece portions of the conversation, which took place over lunch at posh Le Cirque in New York, ran on three pages of the October issue of Good Housekeeping magazine. The full transcript of the interview, though, runs 68 pages long, and POLITICO obtained it from an archive of Smith’s papers kept at the Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas in Austin.\\nMuch of the interview focused on subjects that have defined Trump’s public persona for years—his reality TV show, his beauty pageants, his casinos and his views on women and marriage. He expressed great optimism about his upcoming wedding—his third—to Melania Knauss because she was “only interested in what’s good for me. And I say that with the greatest deal of respect. I mean, she’s really far more interested in me than she is in herself.”\\nBut it was in the final minutes, when Smith and Trump began to dish like old friends, that the still-running tape recorder captured much more revealing thoughts about political matters—from both of them—that Good Housekeeping readers didn’t get to see.\\n“Well,” Smith said, “I won’t print this, but just for my own personal interest, how do you feel about the election? Are you going to vote for George Bush again?”\\n“Just off the record,” Trump said, “I think he’s done a terrible job.” That assessment would sound familiar to anyone who has listened to Trump bash the 43rd president during this campaign cycle. But Smith’s question also elicited an unexpected take on Bush’s opponent that year.\\n“How bad, how much worse, could John Kerry make it?” Smith said. “Not that I like him.”\\n“I don’t think he can make it worse,” Trump said. “I think he’ll be fine. I know them both. But I tell you, just off the record, because I don’t want to say anything at this point …”\\n“No, I’m not, I wouldn’t ask you …”\\n“But, you know, he has done a terrible job. Iraq is a disaster. There were no terrorists in Iraq because they were afraid to be in Iraq. Now they’re all going to Iraq because nobody’s afraid anymore.”\\n“Yeah, it’s a terrorist state,” she said.\\n“Now it is,” he said. “Before, they used to kill the terrorists. They’d kill them like mosquitoes. And now …”\\nRonald Reagan died June 5, 2004, and Smith told Trump she had been “invited today, by Mrs. Reagan, to come to the president’s funeral. I’m debating about going.”\\n“Do you like her?” Trump asked, taking control of the direction of the conversation.\\n“I did. I do like her. I think she’s …”\\n“You know,” Trump said, “I respect that she was so loyal.”\\n“She’s, I don’t think she was terribly smart,” Smith said. “She’s not a smart person.”\\n“I never heard that statement that you didn’t think she was that smart,” Trump said.\\n“I don’t believe she’s very smart.”\\n“That’s very interesting,” Trump said.\\n“She had really trivial …”\\n“She was never very beautiful,” Trump said. “That’s for sure.”\\n“No, she wasn’t great,” Smith said. “She was pretty. But not great.”\\nPresident Reagan, on the other hand, Trump said, “was truly a handsome man.”\\n“I thought he had, you know, when he was your president, you stood up and you said, ‘That’s my president,’” he said.\\n“There was never a greater teleprompter than Ronald Reagan,” Trump added. “Do you agree with that?”\\n“Yeah,” Smith said. “Well, see, he brought all of those little professional skills along with him,” referring to his show business roots.\\n“He was a genius at that,” Trump said.\\nIn his book, Trump: The Art of the Deal, which came out in November 1987, in the aftermath of his earliest flirtations with running for president, Trump had cast those skills in a quite different light. He wrote that Reagan was “so smooth and so effective a performer that he completely won over the American people. Only now, nearly seven years later, are people beginning to question whether there’s anything beneath that smile.”\\nOver the years, Trump’s assessment of Kerry has changed, too.\\nIn an interview that ran in the October 2004 Playboy, Trump said: “I know him. He’s a great guy. He’s a very smart guy. I think he’s highly underestimated, and I think he’s going to run an amazingly successful campaign. Look at what he did in the primaries. It appeared as if he was off the radar, and all of a sudden he made this great comeback. I have a feeling he’s going to do very well.”\\nAt a campaign rally last August in Iowa, though, Trump savaged the secretary of state over his handling of the Iran nuclear deal negotiations. “We should have doubled and tripled up the sanction and negotiated from strength,” he said. “Instead, we have Kerry that goes on bicycle races. He’s in a bicycle race, he’s 73 years old—73 years old. … He’s in a bicycle race. He falls and breaks his leg. This is our chief negotiator. He’s walking in, and they’re looking at him thinking, ‘What a schmuck.’”\\n“Obviously,” Trump added last month at a campaign stop in Virginia, “Kerry did not read The Art of the Deal.”\\nSmith, who is 93 and lives in New York, couldn’t be reached for comment, and Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks didn’t respond immediately to a request for comment.\\n        Donald Trump, left, and fight promoter Don King in 1988. (DAVID BOOKSTAVER/AP)          Marc Fisher  Senior editor reporting on a wide range of topics  June 10, 2016     NEW YORK — On the way to interview Donald Trump at his office, I asked my taxi driver what he thought about the presidential candidates. He said he was leaning toward Trump, but he’d been hearing that Trump was a racist, and if that were true, that would stop him from casting a ballot for the man. I asked what Trump could do to prove to the cabbie that he wasn’t a racist. After a long pause, the driver, said, “I don’t know. Maybe show some love.” When I sat down with Trump, I told him this story and asked what he might do to dispel the perception that his comments about a Mexican American federal judge, about Mexicans generally, and about Muslims indicated racist attitudes.  [The rant that could derail Trump — and the GOP rush to get him back on track]  This was Trump’s response: “Well, I am not a racist, in fact, I am the least racist person that you’ve ever encountered. I’ll give you an example. It’s funny, I just got this, it was just sent to me by Don King. Now, Don knows more about race than anybody. He owns this newspaper, you know — Don’s made a lot of money. He just sent this to me, look at this.” He handed me a copy of the latest edition of the Call & Post, a black weekly based in Cleveland that King owns. On the back of the paper was a full-page announcement endorsing Trump for president and Bernie Sanders for vice president. “Isn’t that funny?” Trump continued. “You know, Don endorsed me. You wanna take that back with you? You know, this could be a story, it just came out. He just delivered it to my office. But isn’t that funny? This is Don King. Now, Don King knows racism probably better than anybody. He’s not endorsing a racist, okay? Do you want to use it? You can have the story, it just came out. I just got it 10 minutes ago, I don’t know. Whatever.” I tried again: “Are you concerned that people might have this impression of you?” “I’m not concerned,” Trump said. “And actually, I’m not concerned because I don’t think people believe it. And it’s just something that — who was this taxicab, was he African American?” No, I said, the man said he had immigrated from Pakistan. “I see,” Trump said. “Well, I don’t believe that people believe it. And it’s something that has never been — you know, only in a political campaign would people say things like that. But Bill Clinton was called a racist by Obama. Okay? And I don’t believe he’s a racist, but he was called a racist by Obama, and very loudly and very strongly. And to this day, Clinton, he is haunted by that, he hated that. And I do too, but I don’t think people believe Clinton is a racist. I don’t think they believe that I’m a racist.” In the controversy Trump was describing, then-Sen. Barack Obama did not call former president Bill Clinton a racist. During the 2008 Democratic primaries, aides to Obama, who was running against then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, criticized Bill Clinton for dismissing Obama’s popularity as a “fairy tale.”    We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

The small businessman said he won a bid in 1989 to supply $100,000 worth of grand pianos to Trump\\'s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City but was still waiting to be paid months after delivery. The gambling mecca finally told him it ran into financial difficulties and could only give him 70 cents on the dollar. Diehl, 88, told NBC News that even though he held up his end of the contract, he felt he had no choice but to take the discounted payment and lose $30,000 — or about a third of his yearly income. \"I needed the money because the manufacturers needed to be paid,\" he said. \"It hurt. It was hard to get over.\"   We apologize, this video has expired.     Diehl\\'s story of being burned by Trump isn\\'t unique. A USA Today analysis published Thursday uncovered 60 lawsuits by ordinary Americans who say Trump and his businesses failed to pay them for their work. The list includes plumbers and painters, waiters and bartenders, real estate brokers and even law firms who helped him defend such suits. The documents reviewed by the newspaper include:  More than 200 liens since the 1980s that were filed by contractors and workers who said they were stiffed.   Records released by casino regulators in 1990 that show 253 subcontractors on a single project were not paid in full or on time.   Twenty-four Fair Labor Act violations by the Trump Plaza casino and Trump Mortgage for failure to pay minimum wage or overtime. The cases were resolved with an agreement to pay back wages.  Trump told USA Today that if someone wasn\\'t paid, it\\'s because their work wasn\\'t up to snuff. And his daughter, Ivanka, said that the number of disputes is tiny compared to the amount of business her father does “We have hundreds of millions of dollars of construction projects underway. And we have, for the most part, exceptional contractors on them who get paid, and get paid quickly,” she told the newspaper. “But it would be irresponsible if my father paid contractors who did lousy work. And he doesn’t do that.” That rationale sounds familiar to Paul Friel. His family\\'s cabinetry firm won a $400,000 contract to build desks, bars and slot-machine bases at Trump Plaza in the 1980s.  The name of the former Trump Plaza casino in Atlantic City, N.J. spelled out in dirt on the facade of the shuttered casino on Jan. 14, 2015 — three months after work crews removed the letters from the building.Wayne Parry / AP  After they finished and the general contractor approved the work, the company submitted its final bill. Paul and his father Edward were summoned to the casino for a meeting with Trump and his brother, Robert, who told them the work was inferior and they wouldn\\'t get the last payment of $83,600. Donald Trump told Edward Friel he could still work on future projects, said Paul Friel, adding that the invitation undercut the argument that the work was not satisfactory. Friel said the missed last payment ultimately led to the demise of the company, which had been in business since the 1940s. \"It was the beginning of the end for us,\" he told NBC News, adding that his father never got over the loss. \"\"It hurt him right up until he died nine years ago. He was not proud to have been involved with Donald Trump.\" Trump did not respond to NBC News\\' request for comment. But in the USA Today interview, he questioned whether the Friels had done good work.     Told that the general contractor had approved it, Trump told USA Today, \"Well, see here’s the thing. You’re talking about, what, 30 years ago?\" And Ivanka said her father had done the right thing. \"It would be irresponsible if my father paid contractors who did lousy work,\" she said. \"And he doesn\\'t do that.\" Paul Friel said his father was a conservative Republican and would be appalled by Trump\\'s political success if he were still alive. \"He would be embarrassed that Donald Trump is actually going to be the nominee for president for the Republican Party in 2016.\"      Hallie Jackson   Hallie Jackson is senior Washington correspondent for NBC News.

Emma Margolin contributed .        March 15, 2016       PALM BEACH, Fla. —Everything seemed to sparkle at the Mar-a-Lago estate here on a recent afternoon. The sun glinted off the pool and the black Secret Service S.U.V.s in the circular driveway. Palm trees rustled in a warm breeze, croquet balls clicked and a security guard stood at the entrance to Donald J. Trump’s private living quarters. “You can always tell when the king is here,” Mr. Trump’s longtime butler here, Anthony Senecal, said of the master of the house and Republican presidential candidate. The king was returning that day to his Versailles, a 118-room snowbird’s paradise that will become a winter White House if he is elected president. Mar-a-Lago is where Mr. Trump comes to escape, entertain and luxuriate in a Mediterranean-style manse, built 90 years ago by the cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post. Few people here can anticipate Mr. Trump’s demands and desires better than Mr. Senecal, 74, who has worked at the property for nearly 60 years, and for Mr. Trump for nearly 30 of them.   He understands Mr. Trump’s sleeping patterns and how he likes his steak (“It would rock on the plate, it was so well done”), and how Mr. Trump insists — despite the hair salon on the premises — on doing his own hair.    Image Credit...Eric Thayer for The New York Times    Mr. Senecal knows how to stroke his ego and lift his spirits, like the time years ago he received an urgent warning from Mr. Trump’s soon-to-land plane that the mogul was in a sour mood. Mr. Senecal quickly hired a bugler to play “Hail to the Chief” as Mr. Trump stepped out of his limousine to enter Mar-a-Lago. Most days, though, he greeted Mr. Trump with little fanfare, taking the suit he arrived in to be pressed in the full-service laundry in the basement. The next morning, before dawn and after about four hours’ sleep, Mr. Trump would meet him at the arched entrance of his private quarters to accept a bundle of newspapers including The New York Times, The Daily News, The New York Post and the Palm Beach papers. Mr. Trump would emerge hours later, in khakis, a white golf shirt and baseball cap. If the cap was white, the staff noticed, the boss was in a good mood. If it was red, it was best to stay away.   On Sundays, Mr. Trump would drive himself to his nearby golf course, alternating each year between his black Bentley and his white Bentley. Mr. Senecal tried to retire in 2009, but Mr. Trump decided he was irreplaceable, so while Mr. Senecal was relieved of his butler duties, he has been kept around as a kind of unofficial historian at Mar-a-Lago. “Tony, to retire is to expire,” Mr. Trump told him. “I’ll see you next season.” Mr. Senecal, with horn-rimmed glasses, a walrus mustache and a white pocket kerchief in his black jacket, seems to reflect his boss’s worldview: He worries about attacks by Islamic terrorists and is critical of Mr. Trump’s ex-wives.   And like Mr. Trump, he is at ease among the celebrities who visit the estate. But while he might once have admired Dixie Carter sipping crème de menthe by the fireplace and reciting soliloquies from the television show “Designing Women,” these days Mr. Senecal encounters Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey lounging on a couch under the living room’s 21-foot gold-leafed ceiling, or chatting with Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama as he exits the luxurious Spanish Room. The butler’s up-close observations of Mr. Trump over the years have revealed not only the mogul’s quirks — Mr. Trump rarely appears in bathing trunks, for example, and does not like to swim — but also his habitual, self-soothing exaggerations. In the early years, Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka slept in the same children’s suite that Dina Merrill, an actress and a daughter of Mrs. Post, occupied in the 1930s. Mr. Trump liked to tell guests that the nursery rhyme-themed tiles in the room were made by a young Walt Disney.   “You don’t like that, do you?” Mr. Trump would say when he caught Mr. Senecal rolling his eyes. The house historian would protest that it was not true. “Who cares?” Mr. Trump would respond with a laugh. Mr. Trump is abundantly proud of his ability to drive a golf ball, once asking rhetorically during a news conference: “Do I hit it long? Is Trump strong?” Mr. Senecal suggested that Mr. Trump was perhaps not quite as strong as he imagined, remembering times they would hit balls together from the Mar-a-Lago property into the Intracoastal Waterway.    Image  Credit...via Anthony Senecal   “Tony, how far is that?” Mr. Trump would ask. “It’s like 275 yards,” Mr. Senecal would respond, though he said the actual distance was 225 yards. Still, Mr. Senecal said that Mr. Trump could be generous when the mood struck him, sometimes peeling $100 bills from a wad in his pocket to give to the groundskeepers, whom Mr. Senecal described as appreciative. “You’re a Hispanic and you’re in here trimming the trees and everything, and a guy walks up and hands you a hundred dollars,” Mr. Senecal said. “And they love him, not for that, they just love him.”   According to Mar-a-Lago lore, Mrs. Post, who was once the wealthiest woman in the United States, scoped out the property that would become the estate in the 1920s by crawling through the junglelike brush between Lake Worth and the Atlantic Ocean. She imported stone from Genoa, Italy, and 16th-century Flemish tapestries that she protected by drawing the drapes in the brightest hours. (They faded after Mr. Trump bought the place and blasted the living room with sunlight.) When she died in 1973, Mrs. Post left the house to the United States government with the intent that it would become a presidential retreat. But the upkeep proved too expensive, and ownership was transferred back to Mrs. Post’s daughters, who unloaded it to Mr. Trump for less than $10 million in 1985. He turned it into a private club a decade later. These days, what really seems to bug Mr. Trump is the sound of planes over the property. Whereas Mrs. Post ensured that the nearby airport would divert flights away from the estate during her stays, the same courtesy has not been extended to Mr. Trump, and the constant roar of engines “drives him nuts,” Mr. Senecal said.   “Tony,” Mr. Trump would often shout. “Call the tower!” The candidate is suing the county-run airport. He has also sued the town in a dispute over the size of his estate’s flagpole; the size of the banquet hall he added to the property; and the size of the club, which, to frighten the local gentry, he once threatened to sell to followers of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon. More recently, Mar-a-Lago has set off controversy in the Republican primary, as Mr. Trump has been criticized by rivals for hiring employees from abroad to staff the club rather than relying on the local work force. “There are a lot of Romanians, there’s a lot of South Africans, we have one Irishman,” Mr. Senecal said of the staff, before echoing Mr. Trump’s defense that locals shunned the short-term seasonal work. But he also added of the foreigners: “They’re so good. They are so professional. These local people,” he trailed off, making a disapproving face.   Over the decades, he has grown close to the Trump family. He recalled how Mr. Trump’s father, Fred C. Trump, once stepped out of his limo on the club’s gravel driveway and remarked to Mr. Senecal, “Somebody better get that coin.” The butler went on his hands and knees and after a few minutes found a crusty penny. “His eyes were incredible,” Mr. Senecal said of Fred Trump. “Mr. Trump has the same eyes.” He also remembered Donald Trump’s young sons running through the library, paneled with centuries-old British oak and filled with rare first-edition books that no one in the family ever read. When the library became a bar, Mr. Trump put a portrait of himself on a wall, posing in tennis whites. “I’ve been in other homes in Palm Beach — same exact painting,” Mr. Senecal confided archly. “Just a different head.” Mr. Senecal adored the Trump children, but found Ivana, Mr. Trump’s first wife, an especially demanding presence. She would instruct him to “get that spot out of that rug” and then do it herself if he failed. She would occasionally tell Mr. Senecal to have the gardeners go inside because she wanted to swim naked in the pool. In 1990, Mr. Senecal took a sabbatical to become the mayor of a town in West Virginia, where he gained some notoriety for a proposal requiring all panhandlers to carry begging permits. He said that Mr. Trump wrote to him, “This is so great, Tony.” Mr. Senecal returned in 1992, and took up his old residence in the butler’s room, but was soon asked to move out after Mr. Trump married Marla Maples, who “really didn’t belong here,” Mr. Senecal said. Also, Mr. Trump wanted to rent the room out to members.   A decade later, Mr. Trump decided to put his own imprint on Mar-a-Lago by building the 20,000-square-foot Donald J. Trump Ballroom. The venue made its big debut with the 2005 wedding of Mr. Trump to Melania Trump, whom Mr. Senecal described as exceptionally compassionate. Tony Bennett, whose paintings hang in the mansion, sang. Mr. Senecal greeted guests at the door, including Hillary Clinton. (In the interview, he offered a profane description for Mrs. Clinton, the front-runner in the Democratic presidential race.) The ballroom later hosted an 80th birthday party for Maya Angelou, thrown by Oprah Winfrey, during which part of the hall was set aside for a “religious ceremony with the hooting and the hollering,” Mr. Senecal recalled. “Mr. Trump was right on into it. It was so great. He was clapping.” Mr. Senecal’s admiration for his longtime boss seems to know few limits. On March 6, as Mr. Trump made his way through the living room on his way to the golf course, Mr. Senecal called out “All rise!” to the club members and staff. They rose. Mr. Trump was wearing a “Make America Great Again” cap. It was white, not red. He seemed in a good mood.    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Donald Trump says the military would listen to him\\n \\n 01:28\\n \\n - Source:\\n CNN\\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n\\n Editor’s Note: Michael D’Antonio is the author of the new book “Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success” (St. Martin’s Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\\n\\n \\n Story highlights\\n \\n Trump biographer Michael D\\'Antonio says Donald Trump has often let his inner child dictate his behavior\\n Trump: \"When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I\\'m basically the same.\"\\n \\n\\n  \\n \\n CNN\\n \\xa0—\\xa0\\n \\n\\n \\n When I asked Donald Trump in 2014 about his temperament, he readily volunteered this: “When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I’m basically the same. The temperament is not that different.”\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n As a grade-schooler Trump threw cake around a birthday party and gave a teacher a black eye because, as he wrote in his own book “The Art of the Deal”, the man didn’t know what he was talking about. Trump told me in interviews I did with him for a biography that as a boy he just “loved to fight.” Pressed to explain, he added, “Any kind of fight, I loved it, including physical.” \\n \\n \\n \\n The grown-up Donald also told me that he doesn’t respect the people he meets in life because “most people aren’t worthy of respect.” This is the motto of the vestigial aspect of the personality that a psychotherapist would call his “inner child.” \\n \\n \\n As a child at the private Kew-Forest School in Queens, where the young gentlemen wore ties and blazers, young Donald likely didn’t meet up with the kind of New York public school boys who would have helped him learn to respect others. Instead he became a prep-school terror that no one could manage. His exasperated parents finally sent him off to a military academy. There, grown men whom Trump described as drill sergeants who would “smack the hell out of you,” taught him that adults play by bully-boy rules, too. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Which brings us to Thursday’s debate. Again in a coat and tie, Donald was the misbehaving bully boy. You could almost hear the squeals of little kids as Trump taunted his opponent, a United States senator, by repeatedly calling him “little Marco” and boasted about the size of his own penis. For Sen. Ted Cruz he used the phrase, “Lyin’ Ted.” The moderators, playing the role of teachers on the playground, struggled for control. “Mr. Trump it’s not your turn,” said Chris Wallace, in a stern tone young Donald must have heard a thousand times. “You’ll get your turn, sir.”\\n \\n \\n \\n And so it went, for much of the debate among candidates who believe they should be President of the United States and commander in chief of the world’s most powerful military. That means control of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, which if detonated would be sufficient to destroy civilization several times over. \\n \\n \\n Having realized, late in the game, that they are being bested by an out-of-control child, Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio got down on his level. The live audience often responded with hoots and jeers. They too expressed themselves as out-of-control children, forgetting their manners and ignoring the fact that they had come to hear from men who seek to lead the greatest power the world has ever seen.\\n \\n \\n How much of Donald Trump’s inner child is on display in his business career? One of his former executives, Barbara Res, wrote in the New York Daily News, “He has an incredible temper and he lashes out at everyone…” \\n \\n \\n And a letter recently revealed by writer Jeff Pearlman attests to his mistreatment of his fellow owners in the now-defunct United States Football League. After recounting Trump’s terrible behavior, including “personal abuse of the commissioner and various of your partners” who disagreed with him, John F. Bassett, owner of the Tampa Bay Bandits, warned him to behave or “I’ll have no regrets whatsoever punching you right in the mouth.”\\n \\n \\n \\n Fortunately, in many settings, Trump has controlled his childish tendencies. In negotiations with banks and governments he has generally behaved like an adult. We can hope that he would do so on the nation’s behalf. However others, including terrorist groups and other nations, who have seen how he can be provoked during the campaign may be tempted to do the same to a President Trump. \\n \\n \\n In addition to his lack of impulse control, Donald has long exhibited a child’s inability to accept responsibility. This trait is familiar to those have seen Trump in action over the years. During the demolition of the building that occupied the Trump Tower site, he was caught destroying precious artwork that was supposed to be preserved. He offered excuses of the sort you’d hear from a kid who just broke a window with a baseball. \\n \\n \\n \\n Next came an insult-spiced brawl with the mayor of New York, ridiculous claims about the British royal family buying his real estate, and an ugly tabloid sex scandal. In the cases of his failed airline, four huge bankruptcies, and more ugly controversies than can be counted, Donald offered excuses but not a sense of responsibility.\\n \\n \\n Victims of Trump’s abusive behavior number in the thousands, and include, on a civic level, many communities where he promised big investments and developments but delivered much less than was expected. In Scotland, for example, he demanded and received permission to destroy part of a sensitive eco-system to build a golf course but walked away from his commitment to build housing. His excuse was that he wasn’t treated well enough by the Scots. \\n \\n \\n \\n Yet Trump’s admirers can be counted in the millions. They watch him grin and scowl and listen as he lets fly with the most ugly kinds of rhetoric, and find themselves excited by his enthusiasm and lack of restraint. This is the paradoxical effect of the bad little boy. Yes, he’s out of line and must be taught to respect others. However the sight and sound of someone behaving with such an unbridled enthusiasm is also thrilling. \\n \\n \\n \\n When Trump sees a protester and says, “I’d like to punch him in the face,” he is expressing the kind of aggressive impulse we have all felt but learned to control He is also showing us what he thinks of us. As he told me, Trump always operates with the assumption that human beings are vicious creatures. “Man is the most vicious of all animals,” he has said. This is the assumption he has brought to the campaign.\\n \\n \\n This week, as his opponents attempted to take Trump down using his own methods, elders in the Republican Party have expressed their alarm and begun to call on voters to settle down. Talk of convention chaos and even a breakaway effort to promote a third candidate to face Trump and the Democratic Party’s nominee suggests more chaos in the month ahead. \\n \\n \\n The outcome will depend on whether the grownups get control or our own inner children, set loose in the excitement of Boy Donald’s performance, choose to run wild. \\n \\n \\n  Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

Speaking in Iowa, Trump claimed he could withstand any attempt by his political rivals to knock him off his top perch. His typically inflammatory comments come as Trump’s Republican rival Marco Rubio won the endorsement Saturday from the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s biggest and most influential newspaper. The Register picked Hillary Clinton for the Democrats, nine days from the first nominating contest in Iowa. The endorsements were big developments for both Rubio and Clinton. Rubio, a Florida senator, has been running third behind Trump and Texas Senator Ted Cruz in Iowa, while Clinton has struggled to fend off a challenge to the Democratic nomination from Bernie Sanders. Trump and Cruz, Trump’s chief obstacle to a victory in Iowa, held competing rallies across the state while in New Hampshire, other candidates battled for votes in that state’s 9 February first-in-the-nation primary for the 8 November election. Trump, the New York billionaire and former reality TV star who has been virtually impervious to attacks from his opponents, pushed the limits of his political rhetoric again in Sioux Center, Iowa. “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose any voters,” he said.    For his rivals, Trump has become a hard target to criticise because not all of his supporters are conservatives and many are most interested in his projection of strength, not where he stands on a particular issue. The latest Reuters-Ipsos tracking poll had Trump pulling in 40.6% support of Republican voters nationally. A CNN/ORC poll has Trump up in Iowa with 37% to 26% for Cruz, who has led in some other Iowa polls. Trump did not repeat the “shoot somebody” line at a later rally in Pella, while stressing to the crowd there that he would tone down his rhetoric as president. Cruz responded to Trump at an event in Ankeny, where he picked up the endorsement of conservative firebrand Glenn Beck, a counterweight of sorts to Trump’s endorsement by 2008 vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin.  “Listen, I will let Donald speak for himself. I can say I have no intention of shooting anybody in this campaign,” Cruz said.   Beck was more direct. “There is one thing to have a healthy ego, there is another to give a man who believes those kind of things, who has a habit of anyone who stands in his way of destruction,” Beck said. “To give that man the full power and scope of the office of the presidency is something we will grow to regret. During his speech, Trump called Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly biased and said she should not be a moderator at a Fox-hosted Republican debate in Des Moines on Thursday. Kelly’s questioning at an 6 August debate in Cleveland had prompted Trump to unleash a series of insults at her. There was no indication that Fox planned to remove her as a moderator. “Megyn Kelly has no conflict of interest. Donald Trump is just trying to build up the audience for Thursday’s debate, for which we thank him,” said a Fox News spokesman.      During the Atlantic City casino boom in the 1980s, Philadelphia cabinet-builder Edward Friel Jr. landed a $400,000 contract to build the bases for slot machines, registration desks, bars and other cabinets at Harrah\\'s at Trump Plaza. The family cabinetry business, founded in the 1940s by Edward’s father, finished its work in 1984 and submitted its final bill to the general contractor for the Trump Organization, the resort’s builder. Edward’s son, Paul, who was the firm’s accountant, still remembers the amount of that bill more than 30 years later: $83,600. The reason: the money never came.\\xa0“That began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company… which has been around since my grandfather,” he said.  Donald Trump often portrays himself as a savior of the working class who will \"protect your job.\" But a\\xa0USA TODAY NETWORK analysis found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades — and\\xa0a large number of\\xa0those involve ordinary Americans, like the Friels, who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them. At least 60 lawsuits, along with hundreds of liens, judgments, and other government filings reviewed by the USA TODAY NETWORK, document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work. Among them: a dishwasher in Florida. A glass company in New Jersey.\\xa0A carpet company. A plumber. Painters. Forty-eight waiters. Dozens of bartenders and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs, coast to coast. Real estate brokers who sold his properties. And, ironically, several law firms that once represented him in these suits and others. Trump’s companies have also been cited for 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act since 2005 for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage, according to U.S. Department of Labor data. That includes 21 citations against the defunct Trump Plaza in Atlantic City and three against the also out-of-business Trump Mortgage LLC in New York.\\xa0Both cases were resolved by\\xa0the companies agreeing to pay back wages.  Litigator in chief  In addition to the lawsuits, the review found more than 200 mechanic’s liens — filed by contractors and employees against Trump, his companies or his properties claiming they were owed money for their work — since the 1980s.\\xa0The liens range from a $75,000 claim by a Plainview, N.Y., air conditioning and heating company to a $1 million claim from the president of a New York City real estate banking firm. On just one project, Trump’s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, records released by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1990 show that at least 253 subcontractors weren’t paid in full or on time, including workers who installed walls, chandeliers and plumbing. The actions in total paint a portrait of Trump’s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years. In some cases, the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents, draining their resources. Some just give up the fight, or settle for less; some have ended up in bankruptcy or out of business altogether. Trump and his daughter Ivanka, in an interview with USA TODAY, shrugged off the lawsuits and other claims of non-payment. If a company or worker he hires isn’t paid fully, the Trumps said, it’s because The Trump Organization was unhappy with the work. “Let’s say that they do a job that’s not good, or a job that they didn’t finish, or a job that was way late. I’ll deduct from their contract, absolutely,” Trump said. “That’s what the country should be doing.” To be sure, Trump and his companies have prevailed in many legal disputes over missing payments, or reached settlements that cloud the terms reached by the parties. However, the consistent circumstances laid out in those lawsuits and other non-payment claims raise questions about Trump’s judgment as a businessman, and as a potential commander- in- chief. The number of companies and others alleging he hasn’t paid suggests that either his companies have a poor track record hiring workers and assessing contractors, or that Trump businesses renege on contracts, refuse to pay, or consistently attempt to change payment terms after work is complete as is alleged in dozens of court cases. In the interview, Trump repeatedly said\\xa0the cases were “a long time ago.” However, even as he campaigns for the presidency, new cases are continuing. Just last month, Trump Miami Resort Management LLC settled with 48 servers at his Miami golf resort over failing to pay overtime for a special event. The settlements averaged about $800 for each worker and as high as $3,000 for one, according to court records. Some workers put in 20-hour days over the 10-day Passover event at Trump National Doral Miami, the lawsuit contends. Trump’s team initially argued a contractor hired the workers, and he wasn’t responsible, and counter-sued the contractor demanding payment. “Trump could have settled it right off the bat, but they wanted to fight it out, that’s their M.O.” said Rod Hannah, of Plantation, Fla., the lawyer who represented the workers, who he said are forbidden\\xa0from talking about the case in public. “They’re known for their aggressiveness, and if you have the money, why not?” Similar cases have cropped up with Trump’s facilities\\xa0in California and New York, where hourly workers, bartenders\\xa0and wait staff have sued with a range of allegations from not letting workers take breaks\\xa0to\\xa0not passing along tips to servers. Trump\\'s company\\xa0settled the California case,\\xa0and the New York case is pending. Trump\\'s Doral golf resort also has\\xa0been\\xa0embroiled in recent\\xa0non-payment claims by two different paint firms,\\xa0with one case settled and the other pending. Last month, his company’s refusal to pay one Florida painter\\xa0more than $30,000 for work at Doral led\\xa0the judge in the case to order foreclosure of the resort if the contractor isn’t paid. Juan Carlos Enriquez, owner of The Paint Spot, in South Florida, has been waiting more than two years to get paid for his work at the Doral. The Paint Spot first filed a lien against Trump’s course, then filed a lawsuit asking a Florida judge to intervene. In courtroom testimony, the manager of the general contractor for the Doral renovation admitted that a decision was made not to pay The Paint Spot because Trump “already paid enough.” As the construction manager spoke, “Trump’s trial attorneys visibly winced, began breathing heavily, and attempted to make eye contact” with the witness, the judge noted in his ruling. That, and other evidence, convinced the judge The Paint Spot’s claim was credible.\\xa0He ordered last month that the Doral resort be foreclosed on, sold, and the proceeds used to pay Enriquez the money he was owed. Trump’s attorneys have since filed a motion to delay the sale, and the contest continues. Enriquez still hasn’t been paid. Trump frequently boasts that he will bring jobs back to America, including Tuesday in a primary-election night victory speech at his golf club in suburban New York City.\\xa0“No matter who you are, we\\'re going to protect your job,” Trump said Tuesday. “Because let me tell you, our jobs are being stripped from our country like we\\'re babies.” But the\\xa0lawsuits show Trump’s organization wages Goliath vs David legal battles over small amounts of money that are negligible to the billionaire and his executives — but devastating to his much-smaller foes. In 2007, for instance, dishwasher Guy Dorcinvil filed a federal lawsuit against Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club resort in Palm Beach, Fla., alleging the club failed to pay time-and-a-half for overtime he worked over three years and the company failed to keep proper time records for employees.   Mar-a-Lago LLC agreed to pay Dorcinvil $7,500 to settle the case in 2008. The terms of the settlement agreement includes a standard statement that Mar-a-Lago does not admit fault and forbids Dorcinvil or his lawyers from talking about the case, according to court records. Developers with histories of not paying contractors are a very small minority of the industry, said Colette Nelson, chief advocacy officer of the American Subcontractors Association. But late or missing payments can be devastating for small businesses and their employees. “Real estate is a tough and aggressive business, but most business people don’t set out to make their money by breaking the companies that they do business with,” she said, stressing she couldn’t speak directly to the specifics of cases in Trump’s record. “But there are a few.” In the interview, Trump said\\xa0that complaints represent a tiny fraction of his business empire and dealings with contractors and employees, insisting all are paid fairly.\\xa0“We pay everybody what they’re supposed to be paid, and we pay everybody on time,” he said. “And we employ thousands and thousands of people. OK?” Despite the Trumps’ assertion that his their companies\\xa0only refuse payment to contractors “when somebody does a bad job,” he has sometimes offered to hire those same contractors again. It’s a puzzling turn of events, since most people who have a poor experience with a contractor, and who refuse to pay and even fight the contractor in\\xa0court, aren’t likely to offer to rehire them.   Nevertheless, such was the case for the Friels. After submitting the final bill for the Plaza casino cabinet-building in 1984, Paul Friel said he got a call asking that his father, Edward, come to the Trump family’s offices at the casino for a meeting. There Edward, and some other contractors, were called in one by one to meet with Donald Trump and his brother, Robert Trump. “He sat in a room with nine guys,” Paul Friel said. “We found out some of them were carpet guys. Some of them were glass guys. Plumbers. You name it.” In the meeting, Donald Trump told his father that the company’s work was inferior, Friel said, even though the general contractor on the casino had approved it. The bottom line, Trump told Edward Friel, was the company wouldn\\'t get the final payment. Then, Friel said Trump added something that struck the family as bizarre. Trump told his dad that he could work on other Trump projects in the future. “Wait a minute,” Paul Friel said, recalling his family\\'s reaction to his dad’s account of the meeting. “Why would the Trump family want a company who they say their work is inferior to work for them in the future?” Asked about the meeting this week, Trump said, “Was the work bad? Was it bad work?” And, then, after being told that the general contractor had approved it, Trump added, “Well, see here’s the thing. You’re talking about, what, 30 years ago?” Ivanka Trump added that any number of disputes over late or deficient payments that were found over the past few decades pale in comparison to the thousands of checks Trump companies cut each month. “We have hundreds of millions of dollars of construction projects underway. And we have, for the most part, exceptional contractors on them who get paid, and get paid quickly,” she said, adding that she doubted any contractor complaining in court or in the press would admit they delivered substandard work. “But it would be irresponsible if my father paid contractors who did lousy work. And he doesn’t do that.” But, the Friels’ story is similar to experiences of hundreds of other contractors over the casino-boom decade in Atlantic City.\\xa0Legal records, New Jersey Casino Control Commission records and contemporaneous local newspaper stories recounted time and again tales about the Trumps paying late or renegotiating deals for dimes on the dollar.   A half-decade after the Friels’ encounter, in 1990, as Trump neared the opening of his third Atlantic City casino, he was once again attempting to pay contractors less than he owed. In casino\\xa0commission records of an audit, it was revealed that Trump’s companies owed a total of $69.5 million to 253 subcontractors on the Taj Mahal project. Some already had sued Trump, the state audit said; others were negotiating with Trump to try to recover what they could. The companies and their hundreds of workers had installed walls, chandeliers, plumbing, lighting and even the casino’s trademark minarets. One of the builders was Marty Rosenberg, vice president of Atlantic Plate Glass Co., who said he was owed about $1.5 million for work at the Taj Mahal. When it became clear Trump was not going to pay in full, Rosenberg took on an informal leadership role, representing about 100 to 150 contractors in negotiations with Trump. Rosenberg’s mission: with Trump offering as little as 30 cents on the dollar to some of the contractors, Rosenberg wanted to get as much as he could for the small businesses, most staffed by younger tradesmen with modest incomes and often families to support. “Yes, there were a lot of other companies,\" he said of those Trump left waiting to get paid. \"Yes, some did not survive.\" Rosenberg said his company was among the lucky ones. He had to delay paying his own suppliers to the project. The negotiations led to him eventually getting about 70 cents on the dollar for his work, and he was able to pay all of his suppliers in full. The analysis of Trump lawsuits\\xa0also found that professionals, such as real estate agents and lawyers, say he\\'s refused\\xa0to pay them sizable sums of money.\\xa0Those cases\\xa0show that even some loyal employees, those selling his properties and fighting for him in court, are only with him\\xa0until they’re not. Real estate broker Rana Williams, who said she had sold hundreds of millions of dollars in Manhattan property for Trump International Realty over more than two decades with the company, sued in 2013 alleging Trump shorted her $735,212 in commissions on deals she brokered from 2009 to 2012. Williams, who managed as many as 16 other sales agents for Trump, said the tycoon and his senior deputies decided to pay her less than her contracted commission rate “based on nothing more than whimsy.” Trump and Williams settled their case in 2015, and the terms of the deal are confidential, as is the case in dozens of other settlements between plaintiffs and Trump companies. However, Williams\\' 2014 deposition in the case is not sealed. In her sworn testimony, Williams said the 2013 commission shortage wasn\\'t the only one, and neither was she the only person who didn\\'t get fully paid. “There were instances where a sizable commission would come in and we would be waiting for payment and it wouldn’t come,” she testified. “That was both for myself and for some of the agents.” Another broker, Jennifer McGovern, filed a similar lawsuit against the now-defunct Trump Mortgage LLC in 2007, citing a six-figure commission on real-estate sales that she said went unpaid. A judge issued a judgment ordering Trump Mortgage to pay McGovern $298,274. Even Trump’s own attorneys, on several occasions, sued him over claims of unpaid bills. One law firm that fought contractors over payments and other issues for Trump — New York City’s Morrison Cohen LLP — ended up on the other side of a similar battle with the mogul in 2008. Trump didn’t like that its lawyers were using his name in press releases touting its representation of Trump in a lawsuit against a construction contractor that Trump claimed overcharged him for work on a luxury golf club. As Trump now turned his ire on his former lawyers, however, Morrison Cohen counter-sued. In court records, the law firm alleged Trump didn’t pay nearly a half million dollars in legal fees. Trump and his ex-lawyers settled their disputes out of court, confidentially, in 2009. In 2012, Virginia-based law firm Cook, Heyward, Lee, Hopper & Feehan filed a lawsuit against the Trump Organization for $94,511 for legal fees and costs. The case was eventually settled out of court. But as the case unfolded, court records detail how Trump\\'s senior deputies attacked the attorneys\\' quality of work in the local and trade press, leading the firm to make claims of defamation that a judge ultimately rejected on free speech grounds. Trump claims in his presidential personal financial disclosure to be worth $10 billion as a result of his business acumen.\\xa0Many of the small contractors and individuals who weren’t paid by him haven’t been as fortunate.   Edward Friel, of the Philadelphia cabinetry company allegedly shortchanged for the casino work, hired a lawyer to sue for the money, said his son, Paul Friel.\\xa0But the attorney advised him that the Trumps would drag the case out in court and legal fees would exceed what they’d recover. The unpaid bill took a huge chunk out of the bottom line of the company that Edward ran to take care of his wife and five kids. “The worst part wasn’t dealing with the Trumps,” Paul Friel said. After standing up to Trump, Friel said the family struggled to get other casino work in Atlantic City.\\xa0“There’s tons of these stories out there,” he said. The Edward J.

Talk about winning! Even before moving into the White House, Donald Trump has added more articles to the Constitution! He leaves the Capitol building this morning after performing this feat. (Joshua Roberts / Reuters.)   Charles Stevenson, long-time Congressional staffer and author of many books about the politics and policy of national security, writes about Donald Trump’s meeting this morning with Republicans on Capitol Hill:   You may have seen this TPM report about Trump’s meeting with House GOP. I think this part is especially significant: Another Republican in the meeting who declined to go on the record so he could speak candidly told TPM that Trump was asked pointedly if he would defend Article I of the Constitution. “Not only will I stand up for Article One,” Trump enthusiastically stated, according to the member in the room. “I\\'ll stand up for Article Two, Article 12, you name it of the Constitution.” The Republican member said that Trump’s lack of knowledge about how many articles exist, gave him “a little pause.” (The Constitution has seven articles and 27 amendments.) Besides indicating Trump has little real knowledge of the Constitution, it also shows an insensitivity to the purpose of the question. Article I lists the powers of the Congress, which many Republicans say has been undermined by an overreaching Obama. Trump doesn’t seem to understand that he was being asked about legislative-executive relations and the proper balance between those branches. He didn\\'t know, and probably doesn’t care. Lawmakers should.   *** For Trump’s “Two Corinthians” reference, suggesting he is as unfamiliar with nuances of the Bible as he is with the Constitution’s, check NPR’s story here.

Donald Trump acknowledged Sunday that he\\'s receiving intelligence briefings less frequently than other President-elects have in the past, explaining that he doesn\\'t \"have to be told\" of the critical session\\'s findings because he\\'s \"a smart person.\" In a wide-ranging interview with \"Fox News Sunday,\" Trump, who is receiving the briefings on a weekly basis, seemed to suggest that he should only be briefed when there is new material. \"I get it when I need it,\" he explained to Fox\\'s Chris Wallace. \"These are very good people that are giving me the briefings. And I say, \\'If something should change from this point, immediately call me. I\\'m available on one-minute\\'s notice.\" \"I don\\'t have to be told — you know, I\\'m, like, a smart person. I don\\'t have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years. Could be eight years — but eight years. I don\\'t need that,\" Trump continued. \"But I do say, \\'If something should change, let us know,\\'\" he said. Trump went on to suggest that it\\'s not necessary for him to receive the briefings with the daily frequency that many past President-elects have had because other key advisers are getting the same info. \"In the meantime, my generals are great — are being briefed. And Mike Pence is being briefed, who is, by the way, one of my very good decisions,\" Trump said. \"And they\\'re being briefed. And I\\'m being briefed also. But if they\\'re going to come in and tell me the exact same thing that they tell me — you know, it doesn\\'t change, necessarily.\" \"Now, there will be times where it might change. I mean, there will be some very fluid situations,\" Trump said. \"I\\'ll be there not every day, but more than that. But I don\\'t need to be told, Chris, the same thing every day, every morning — same words. \\'Sir, nothing has changed. Let\\'s go over it again.\\' I don\\'t need that.\" Reuters reported Friday that Trump was only taking once-a-week sit-downs on highly-classified information about vital U.S. concerns. The briefings typically include highly confidential information, such as secrets about U.S. espionage sources and covert operations overseas, and material prepared by the CIA, the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and other parts of the U.S. intelligence community. Trump\\'s latest comments prompted immediate criticism, but mostly from Democrats. \"If Trump was as smart as he keeps telling us, he would appreciate all he has to learn,\" tweeted Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. \"#TakeTheBriefings,\" he added.    Melania Trump listens to her husband US President-elect Donald Trump speak to the press at the US Capitol in Washington on Nov. 10, 2016. (Nicholas Kamm/Getty Images)  President-elects are entitled — but not required — to hear the President\\'s Daily Brief, just like the sitting President does, but they\\'ve been more weekly for Trump, the news service reported. Trump\\'s transition team said he does have regular updates on national security and other matters — but declined to specify the frequency. He does receive \"routine\" intelligence bulletins and has also requested specific briefings from intelligence agencies on particular topics of interest, sources told Reuters. Those subjects to date have not included Russia or Iran. Trump\\'s once-a-week average is far fewer than most of his recent predecessors, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter. Pence, however, gets briefings six days a week on a variety of topics, sources said — closer to the usual model set by incoming administrations. While the briefings are not mandatory for President-elects, it\\'s customary for the transition process to start sometime in late November, experts said. Trump and Pence\\'s predecessors sat for \"daily or near-daily intelligence briefings\" between their elections and their inaugurations, according to Former Central Intelligence Agency briefer David Priess. Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan did not start receiving their daily briefings until later in November, Priess said. But Trump is not the first president to ignore briefings, Priess noted. After his first election, Richard Nixon spurned face-to-face daily talks with intelligence officials. He had written briefs delivered to his office, only for a \"stack\" of them to be later returned to the CIA, unopened, Priess said.  \\nDonald Trump praises the loyalty of his supporters on Saturday, saying that he could shoot somebody ‘on the middle of fifth avenue’ and wouldn’t lose any voters.

One boastful tip from Trump: “Always be around unsuccessful people because everybody will respect you.”</p><p>“When I saw all this youth, this great-looking, young people, I said I’m going to talk for a few minutes about success. Should I do that?” Trump asked the crowd gathered at St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin, as he pivoted from talking about how the Republican Party has treated him unfairly in the delegate-selection process. </p><p>Conceding that “there’s a certain amount of luck” involved in success, Trump recounted the story of “a friend who’s just an unlucky guy. Just an unlucky guy.” </p><p>“He’s smart, he went to the Wharton School of Finance, he’s smart, actually he’s a brilliant guy. He’s always been unlucky. And no matter what happens, it just works that way. And he never really succeeded,” Trump lamented. </p><p>“And you’ll find that when you become very successful, the people that you will like best are the people that are less successful than you, because when you go to a table you can tell them all of these wonderful stories, and they’ll sit back and listen,” he said. “Does that make sense to you? OK? Always be around unsuccessful people because everybody will respect you. Do you understand that?”</p>\\n<p>Trump, the author of more than a dozen books, offered his usual career advice, telling his audience, “You have to absolutely love what you do, ideally love what you do in a good business.\"</p><p>“But you know what, if it’s not necessarily that good, the loving is more important than having that good business,” Trump qualified.</p><p>He then proceeded to tick through a list of professions he saw as not being the highest-paying but whose practitioners he sees as happier.</p><p>“Some people want to be teachers. I mean, some of the happiest people and the most successful people that I know are people that aren’t the richest at all, they don’t make at all the most money,” Trump said. “They’re teachers, they’re scientists, I know people that are scientists — they can’t wait to get to work, they can’t wait. Policemen, you know police departments are, I think terribly disrespected. I think they’re not given the credit for the great job they do, I have to be honest with you.”</p><p>Trump also asserted that most people believe success is measured in the form of monetary success. </p><p>“It’s not really. I mean, to me, a successful person has a great family who loves the family, loves the children and the children love him or her,” the Republican front-runner said. “To me, that’s a much more successful person than a person that’s made a million dollars or 10 million dollars and is miserable and doesn’t have a good family and nobody likes the person.

To understand why, consider the billionaire’s ego not just as mere mortals might see it (an outsized allotment of conceit) but also as Trump himself understands it (an extraordinary drive for excitement, glamour and style that produces extraordinary success.)\\n“People need ego,” Trump has said. “Whole nations need ego.”\\nHis race for the White House, then, is guided by the same instincts he’s relied on in a lifetime of audacious self-promotion, ambition and risk-taking.\\nThose instincts, after all, allowed a fabulously wealthy businessman to pull off a mind meld with the economic anxieties of ordinary Americans, elbowing aside the Republican A-team and breaking every rule of modern politics on the way to the party’s presidential nomination.\\n“I play to people’s fantasies,” Trump has acknowledged. And plenty of voters fantasize about bringing some of that Trump swagger to the American psyche.\\nTrump’s candidacy has given rise to a nation of armchair analysts with their own theories about the man: He’s a bully. He’s a champion. He’s insecure. He’s a rebel. He’s a narcissist. He’s an optimist. He’s calculating. He’s unscripted. He’s a pathological liar. He sees a larger truth.\\nTrump himself shies away from self-analysis. But he’s acknowledged that for much of his life, it’s been all about the chase. Whatever it is, he’s in it to win it.\\n“The same assets that excite me in the chase often, once they are acquired, leave me bored,” he said in 1990 as his boom years were sliding toward bust. “For me, you see, the important thing is the getting, not the having.”\\nThat mindset has generated plenty of speculation about whether Trump really wants to set aside his my-way lifestyle to shoulder the heavy demands of governing.\\nTrump bats away such talk. But his campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, addressing why Trump wants a strong and seasoned running mate, says the candidate sees himself as chairman of the board, not CEO, and “needs an experienced person to do the part of the job he doesn’t want to do.”\\nTrump’s unbounded confidence — and obsession with winning — has been a lifelong constant.\\nOne of five children in a well-to-do Queens real estate family, Donald was the brash one.\\n“We gotta calm him down,” his father would say, as Trump recalls it. “Son, take the lumps out.”\\nIt’s advice he never really embraced.\\nTrump followed his father into real estate, but chafed within the confines of Fred Trump’s realm in New York’s outer boroughs. He crossed into Manhattan and made it big before he hit 40.\\n“He was at the top of his own pyramid,” says Stanley Renshon, a political psychologist at the City University of New York who is writing a book about Trump. “Nobody was going to say, ‘Donald, tone it down.\\'”\\nThrough years of boom, bust and more than a decade of reality-TV celebrity on “The Apprentice,” the deals kept coming and the price tags (and, often, the debt) kept growing — as did the hype. Always the hype.\\n“Harry Potter” actor Daniel Radcliffe recalls an 2005 encounter in the “Today” show studios, when he confessed to the businessman that he was nervous about making a live television appearance. Trump’s advice: “Just tell them you met Mr. Trump,” Radcliffe told “Late Night with Seth Meyers” recently.\\n“To this day,” said Radcliffe, “I can’t even relate to that level of confidence.”\\nTrump is not all chutzpah.\\nA Mississippi man remembers a surprise phone call from Trump after his father wrote asking for a loan to build a hotel back in 1988.

And so far, he hasn’t seemed very sorry. When asked about failing to pay someone by Hillary Clinton this week, Trump replied,\\xa0“Maybe he didn’t do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work.”  I take that attack personally. I’m one of the many\\xa0small business owners\\xa0who’ve been used by Trump, exploited and forced to suffer a loss because of his corporation’s shady practices. My relationship with Trump began in 1989, when he asked me to supply several grand and upright pianos to his then-new Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. I’d been running a music store for more than 30 years at that point, selling instruments to local schools and residents. My business was very much a family affair (my grandsons still run the store). And I had a great relationship with my customers — no one had ever failed to pay. I was thrilled to get a $100,000 contract from Trump. It was one of the biggest sales I’d ever made. I was supposed to deliver and tune the pianos; the Trump corporation would pay me within 90 days. I asked my lawyer if I should ask for payment upfront, and he laughed. “It’s Donald Trump!” he told me. “He’s got lots of money.” But when I requested payment, the Trump corporation hemmed and hawed. Its executives avoided my calls and crafted excuses. After a couple of months, I got a letter telling me that the casino was short on funds. They would pay 70 percent of what they owed me. There was no negotiating. I didn’t know what to do — I couldn’t afford to sue the Trump corporation, and I needed money to pay my piano suppliers. So I took the $70,000. Losing $30,000 was a big hit to me and my family.\\xa0The profit from Trump was meant to be a big part of my salary for the year. So I made much less. There was no money to help grow my business. I had fewer\\xa0pianos in the showroom and a smaller advertising budget. Because of Trump, my store stagnated for a couple of years. It made me feel really bad,\\xa0like I’d been taken advantage of. I was embarrassed. Today, when I hear Trump brag about paying small business owners less than he agreed, I get angry. He’s always suggesting that the people who worked for him didn’t do the right job, didn’t complete their work on time, that something was wrong. But I delivered\\xa0quality pianos, tuned and ready to go. I did everything right. And then Trump cheated me.\\xa0It’s a callous way to do business. Trump keeps saying that it’s time we got a businessman to run the country.\\xa0Of course, I think it’s important to find someone who can bolster the economy. But I also think we need a president who cares about small business owners, and about honoring his commitments. That’s not Trump.

(Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump refused to take responsibility on Sunday for clashes at his campaign events and criticized protesters who have dogged his rallies and forced him to cancel one in Chicago last week.    U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Bloomington, Illinois, March 13, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Young     When a protester interrupted his speech on Sunday at an airport hangar in Bloomington, Illinois, minutes after it began, Trump derided him as a “disrupter” and told the cheering crowd: “Don’t worry about it - I don’t hear their voice.” “Our rallies are so big and we have so many people, I never hear their voices. I only hear our people’s voices saying: ‘There they are, there they are,’” the billionaire businessman said as the audience roared approval and some 2,000 protesters waited outside. Two later rallies on Sunday in Ohio and Florida passed without disruption. Trump is trying to cement his lead over his remaining Republican rivals - U.S. Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Governor John Kasich - in five states that hold presidential nominating contests on Tuesday for Republicans and Democrats: Florida, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri. The four Republicans and Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are vying to run in the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. Trump used a round of Sunday morning television appearances to rebut strong criticism from Republican rivals and Democrats that he was encouraging discord with divisive language disparaging Muslims and illegal immigrants. “I don’t accept responsibility. I do not condone violence in any shape,” Trump said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” The 69-year-old New York real estate mogul defended his supporters and said he was considering helping pay the legal fees of a 78-year-old white man who punched a young black man at a Trump rally in North Carolina last week. The man, Trump said, “got carried away.” “I’ve actually instructed my people to look into it,” he said. The man, John McGraw, was charged with assault and later with communicating a threat after he was seen on video saying he enjoyed hitting “that loudmouth” and threatening next time “to kill him.” Trump had earlier promised to help cover the legal fees of supporters involved in clashes at his rallies. SIMMERING TENSIONS On Friday night, thousands of protesters, many of them telling journalists they were Sanders or Clinton supporters, showed up at the Chicago rally, forcing Trump to cancel the event and casting a shadow over his weekend rallies. Trump drew condemnation from his rivals. “We are now seeing images on television that we haven’t seen in this country since the 1960s, images that make us look like a Third World country,” Rubio, 44, said at a campaign event in The Villages, a retirement community in Florida. “Do we really want to live in a country where Americans hate each other?” Clinton, the Democratic front-runner and former U.S. secretary of state, said Trump was “incredibly bigoted” and pitting Americans against each other. “He is trafficking in hate and fear,” she told CNN. “He is playing to our worst instincts.” Trump said tension at his rallies came from people being “sick and tired” of American leadership that has cost them jobs through trade deals, failed to defeat Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, and treated military veterans poorly. “The people are angry at that - they’re not angry about something I’m saying,” he said. “I’m just the messenger.” Trump has harnessed the discontent of white, working-class voters who blame trade deals for costing them jobs. He has proposed building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, disparaged some Mexican immigrants as criminals and advocated a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. A few dozen protesters, mostly young, stood in the rain outside a later Trump rally on Sunday in West Chester, Ohio, near Cincinnati. Alexander Shelton, a 26-year-old student and activist, wore a white Muslim prayer robe with a picture of the civil rights leader Malcolm X painted on front. “We have to stand up against white supremacy,” he said. “Trump stands for that.” Michael McKinney, 47, a self-employed credit-card processor from Ohio, came to the rally with his wife and young daughter, and blamed the protesters for the violence. “If the protesters don’t act civilly, people on the edge are going to snap,” he said. “We are not a Third World nation. We don’t stand for killing each other because we disagree or even harm each other,” he said. “This isn’t the United States I grew up in.”  Additional reporting by Lucia Mutikana and Patrick Rucker in Washington, Steve Holland in The Villages, Fla., Jim Oliphant in Boca Raton, Fla., and Joe Wessels in West Chester, Ohio; Writing by Doina Chiacu and Jonathan Allen; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Peter Cooney     for-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-up  \\nThe New York Times: Digital and Home Delivery Subscriptions\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Offer for a New York Times News subscription; current subscribers not eligible.

We had not met before and I accepted,” Branson wrote. “Even before the starters arrived he began telling me about how he had asked a number of people for help after his latest bankruptcy and how five of them were unwilling to help. He told me he was going to spend the rest of his life destroying these five people.”\\n\\n\\nBranson “found it very bizarre” that Trump was unwilling to talk about anything else. “I told him I didn’t think it was the best way of spending his life. I said it was going to eat him up, and do more damage to him than them,” Branson wrote. “There must be more constructive ways to spend the rest of your life. (Hopefully my advice didn’t lead to him running for President!)”\\nThe Virgin founder was “baffled” as to why Trump had invited him to lunch for that sole topic and wondered at one point whether Trump would ask him for money.\\n“If he had, I would have become the sixth person on his list!” he quipped. He ultimately left the lunch “feeling disturbed and saddened” by what Trump had said. \\nBranson highlighted the real estate mogul’s “vindictive streak” as the most frightening thing about this election, warning it “could be so dangerous if he got into the White House.”\\n“For somebody who is running to be the leader of the free world to be so wrapped up in himself, rather than concerned with global issues, is very worrying,” he wrote, going on to compare his lunch with Trump to dining with Hillary Clinton.\\n“Here we talked about education reform, the war on drugs, women’s rights, conflicts around the globe and the death penalty. She was a good listener as well as an eloquent speaker,” Branson wrote. “As she understands well, the president of the United States needs to understand and be engaged with wider world issues, rather than be consumed by petty personal quarrels.”\\nThe Trump campaign did not reply to a request for comment.\\n\\n\\n\\n  In a jaw-dropping 2004 interview with Sirius XM shock jock Howard Stern, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said that actress Lindsay Lohan is clearly \"deeply troubled\" and therefore \"great in bed.\"   CNN Money reported Friday on the crude remarks, which Trump made when Lohan was only 18, but becoming known for her wild partying and public displays of intoxication. \"What do you think of Lindsay Lohan?\" Trump asked Stern. \"I think she\\'s hot,\" Stern replied. \"There\\'s something there right?\" Trump said. \"But you have to like freckles. I\\'ve seen a, you know, close up of her chest and a lot of freckles. Are you into freckles?\" \"I\\'m not into freckles, but the red hair thing I like. I like her on the cover of Entertainment Weekly,\" said Stern. A bit later, Trump said, \"Now does the father wreck, does that bother you a little bit?\" \"Oh yeah, because first of all, if the father\\'s a wreck like the way he is...,\" Stern said. \"Right,\" Trump agreed. Stern asked, \"Can you imagine the sex with this troubled teen?\" \"Yeah, you\\'re probably right,\" Trump said. \"She\\'s probably deeply troubled and therefore great in bed. How come the deeply troubled women, you know, deeply, deeply troubled, they\\'re always the best in bed?\" Stern said damaged women are \"looking for love, they\\'re looking for positive affirmation, they\\'re looking for a father figure who will love them and tell them they\\'re wonderful and they\\'ll never be enough. No matter many times you tell them they\\'re beautiful, no matter how many times you tell them you love them they want to suck it up more. They would drain you like a vampire until your head caved in if they could get more love.\" \"Well I have a friend Howard who\\'s actually like a great playboy, I mean, I don\\'t say this about men, this guy does very well,\" Trump said. \"He runs silent, runs deep as they say, like a submarine. He will only look for a crazy women. He says, \\'Donald, Donald, please, please, I only want the crazy women.\\'\" \"They\\'re desperate,\" Stern said. \"What is this guy all about,\" said Trump. \"But for some reason, what I said is true. It\\'s just unbelievable.

Michael Diehl is the retired owner of Freehold Music Center in Freehold, N.J.        Though Donald Trump would be wealthier today if he had simply taken the fortune he inherited from his father and invested it index funds, he holds out his business acumen as his chief qualification for the presidency.  And he doesn’t take kindly to it being questioned. In a 2004 radio interview with Howard Stern, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee dubbed one unnamed reporter “retarded” for critiquing his business skills (which brings to mind his mocking of a disabled reporter earlier this year). Trump’s other supposed qualification is that he is not “politically correct,” and says what his supporters would like to say if they could. In any event, here’s Trump on April 14, 2004, on the Howard Stern Show:   ROBIN: No, but they are saying that then those guys don’t get a return. You always make out but the guys don’t get a return. TRUMP: Okay, I know, and that makes me a bad person right?  STERN: Well, hey, no but the thing is― TRUMP: I know I was criticized in one magazine where the writer was retarded, he said, “Donald Trump put up $7 million, they put up $193 million and they are 50/50 partners. Why isn’t Donald Trump putting up more money?” And you know it is supposed to be because I am smart. STERN: Right, they are hiring you. TRUMP: If I put up this, they put up like 45 times more money, and then they criticize me for not putting up more money. I mean these guys are dopes. But what am I going to do?     CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said the interview had taken place in 2014.    Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S.        Before You Go     Popular in the Community   You May Like\\n  \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump called on evangelical pastors to help him win the presidency this November, which he said is “maybe the only way I’m going to get to heaven.”\\n“For evangelicals, for the Christians, for the everybody, for everybody of religion, this will be, may be, the most important election that our country has ever had,” Trump told a “Pastors in the Pews” meeting of evangelical leaders in Orlando. “And once I get in, I will do my thing that I do very well. And I figure it is probably, maybe the only way I’m going to get to heaven. So I better do a good job.”\\nTrump told the assembled evangelicals that he desperately needed their help in order to win the White House in November, calling on the pastors to get out the vote in their congregation. He said he needed the help especially in swing states like Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, where Trump said religious voters could swing the entire election his way.\\n\\n\\nBut Trump also admitted that he is struggling in traditionally deep-red Utah, where Mormon voters aware of their church’s historical persecution have been skeptical of his occasionally intolerant message.\\n“I’m having a tremendous problem in Utah. Utah is a different place. Is anybody here from Utah? I didn’t think so,” Trump said, prompting laughter from the audience. “We’re having a problem. I mean because, you know, it could cost us the Supreme Court.”\\nThe Manhattan billionaire also blamed evangelical voters for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney’s loss in the 2012 presidential election.\\n“Honestly, you did not vote for Romney. Had you voted for Romney, it would have been much closer,” he said. “You did not vote for Romney. Evangelicals, religion, did not get out and vote. And I don’t know why. Whatever the reason, I’m not sure why.”\\nTrump spent the first half of his roughly 40-minute speech pledging to undo the Johnson Amendment, a rule that the real estate mogul said “silenced” religious leaders politically by threatening to revoke their tax exempt status. In addition to offering a political voice, Trump told the assembled pastors that with the Johnson Amendment removed, church attendance would grow.\\nHe also pledged to appoint conservative Supreme Court justices, but did not mention other issues popular with evangelicals, like abortion or same-sex marriage.\\n“You have to get the people in your churches. You have to get them to go out and vote. Whether you have bus drives, do whatever you have to do,” Trump said. “You have a chance to do something that will be Earth shaking. I literally mean it. Earth shaking. You’ve got to get your people out to vote.”\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\t\\n      March 15, 2016 – After insinuating that a rally protestor was a supporter of ISIS based on a doctored YouTube video, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump defended himself be saying he “only knows what\\'s on the internet.” When asked to elaborate on Tuesday morning, Trump clarified that he only watches a few seconds of the videos he cites at rallies and debates because they provide adequate information at the top, and also due to a longstanding fear of being exposed to “Never Gonna Give You Up” by Rick Astley, commonly known as \\'rick rolling.\\' “It happened to me the first time about six years ago,” Trump told reporters on his way to a rally in Palm Beach, Florida. “Someone I believed was a friend sent me a link to a video he said I had to watch, it said it had breaking news at the beginning. Next thing you know, this weird little ginger fella in an oversized coat is singing that he\\'s never gonna let me down. Well I was feeling pretty let down at that moment, I\\'ll tell ya.” So traumatized was Trump by the experience of being rick rolled, that in a personal transformation which might explain some of his limited information ideas and outsider mentality, he refused to ever watch a video in its entirety again; not just on YouTube, but on all media sites, including mainstream news outlets, as Trump believes they are all so corrupt as to have the potential to foist Astley\\'s oddly deep voice upon him. “I don\\'t even click on email links anymore, don\\'t need \\'em,” Trump said at his rally to raucous cheers. “My brother Robert sends me a link that says \\'Proof That All Syrian Refugees Are Terrorists,\\' I believe him. The headline says it all. I don\\'t need to click on it to learn more, Rob might be messin\\' with me. He and Astley might be playing a trick on yours truly. “If I become president, I promise you, we\\'ll make new laws so you can sue anyone who rick rolls you against your will, and we\\'ll all make a lot of money,” Trump concluded, causing the crowd to go wild. When asked after the rally if he\\'d ever watched the music video in its entirety, Trump said he had, the first time he was exposed to it. In fact, he found it so catchy he couldn\\'t close the webpage until it was over. “I actually really enjoyed it, even though I just said the opposite thing up there onstage,” Trump told reporters. “I just can\\'t stand people trying to make me feel stupid. It\\'s disrespectful and mean-spirited, and the only people who\\'d play that kind of practical joke are probably ugly losers anyway. “I really just feel bad for the other people in the video,” he went on. “They\\'re doing a great job. The women are hot, that\\'s important. And I particularly like the black guy behind the bar with the suspenders. He does a great job. I have a great relationship with the blacks.” When Robert Trump was pressed to provide information on his email claiming \\'Proof That All Syrian Refugees Are Terrorists,\\' he said that more details could be found here. \\n\\n     Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. (Gene J. Puskar/AP)    TAMPA — Donald Trump’s penchant for abusing reporters is well known. He disparages them as “dishonest,” “troublemakers,” and “scum,” and sometimes he calls them out by name. At his rallies, he pens in the press like cattle. Any journalist who dares to wander beyond the metal barricades is tossed out. And yet. The not-so-dirty little secret among reporters who cover Trump is this: It’s a kick to report on his campaign, a constant thrill ride. They love the beat, if not the beatdown. “He’s by far the biggest story of 2016,” says Byron York, the Washington Examiner’s chief political correspondent, who has trailed Trump through eight states. “Other campaigns are more conventional. His events are bigger, the excitement levels are higher.”  That’s not necessarily an endorsement of Trump’s politics. It is a statement in behalf of the thing political journalists root for most — a good story.  Since his announcement as a presidential candidate in June, Trump has been a nonstop story, from his outrageous pronouncements about Mexicans and Muslims to his surprising string of primary victories. Trump’s dominance of the media’s attention has been like a perpetual-motion machine, with each provocative statement attracting more attention, and more support, hence justifying more media attention.  Trump’s rallies have generated not just quotable sound bites, but also arresting — sometimes literally — visuals. The events are now routinely beset by protesters who ignite angry (and occasionally violent) counter-reactions from his supporters. CNN, for example, assigned two teams to Trump’s campaign events this past weekend, one for his speeches inside and another for the action outside. Trump pumps his coverage, too, with an undeniable streak of media-savvy showmanship. For an event Sunday night at an amphitheater in West Boca Raton, Fla., he arrived via his own helicopter; the packed crowd swooned as the chopper descended over the park amid stirring recorded music booming onstage. In other words, Trump supplies the kind of raw material that gets a beat reporter’s work on the front page or at the top of the newscast. “What journalist wouldn’t want to be part of this?” said David Smith, the Washington correspondent for the London-based   Guardian newspaper . “There have been so many twists and turns. And so much interest in him.” Trump takes a keen, almost obsessive interest in the reporters who cover him, too. In an interview last week, he mentioned, without prompting, the names of Washington Post reporters he deemed “fair.” He was less enthralled by some of the newspaper’s editorial columnists, citing columns that were published weeks and even months ago. Beyond the fireworks of Trump’s campaign, Smith, a longtime Africa correspondent, says Trump’s emergence as the leading Republican candidate “raises deeper questions about the state of society that foreign correspondents love to explore.”  He notes, for example, that elections in African countries often feature grandiose, larger-than-life candidates and violent outbreaks among a party’s supporters and opponents. Smith quoted Sen. Marco Rubio as saying that Trump’s campaign resembles something out of “a Third World country.” What’s more, if a presidential candidate in Africa had suggested “opening up” the nation’s libel laws in order to sue the media more easily, or if a candidate routinely exhorted his supporters to turn against the news media — as Trump has — it would probably inspire condemnations from human\\xad-rights groups, Smith said. Reporters on the Trump beat, particularly women, have said they sometimes feel unsafe during his rallies. The threat, however, seems mostly confined to the mass booing of the news media that Trump orchestrates and the occasional catcalls from the crowd. Three journalists have been slightly injured in the course of covering Trump over the past two weeks. Time photographer Christopher Morris was choke-slammed by a Secret Service officer after he sought to take pictures of protesters at a Virginia rally. Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields was bruised after she allegedly was manhandled by Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, while interviewing Trump after a Florida news conference. And CBS News correspondent Sopan Deb suffered a minor cut last week when he was thrown to the ground and arrested by Chicago police while recording an unruly protest outside a rally. Deb was back to covering Trump on Sunday; Fields resigned in a dispute with her employer. But perhaps an equally telling example of Trump’s press relations occurred Sunday night in West Boca Raton. A Trump staffer spotted Michael Mayo, a columnist for the South Florida Sun Sentinel, mingling with the crowd at Trump’s rally and ordered him into the press pen. Mayo declined, and the staffer — who gave his name only as Justin — found a police officer who told Mayo that he faced arrest for trespassing if he didn’t comply. Mayo protested that he had a right to stand peacefully in the crowd, but he left the premises. “Trump wants the press in a pen so he can use us as a prop to mock and deride us,” Mayo said in an interview Tuesday. “I wasn’t there to be used as anyone’s prop.” He added, “I get it. Trump is real news now. He can’t be ignored [by the media]. But a lot of people are playing his game.” For the most part, however, the media following Trump wouldn’t want to be covering anyone else. “He’s the story of the race,” said Adrian Morrow, a political correspondent for Canada’s Globe and Mail newspaper as he interviewed protesters outside Trump’s rally in Tampa on Monday.  Traffic to the Globe and Mail’s website soars when the paper writes “anything” about Trump. That’s not the case when Morrow files dispatches on his usual beat: Ontario’s provincial legislature.   Correction: An earlier version of this report quoted the Guardian’s David Smith as saying Donald Trump’s campaign resembles something out of “a Third World country.” Smith was actually quoting Sen. Marco Rubio.    Donald Trump deliberately walked in on two young Miss USA 2001 contestants while they were naked and getting dressed for a rehearsal, one of the former beauty contestants has claimed in an interview with the Guardian. The two women were putting on their outfits to rehearse the opening number, the former contestant recalled, when Trump, who owned the pageant at the time as part of the Miss Universe family of pageants, burst into the room without a word.   Just before he entered, the former contestant said, she heard the security detail outside the dressing room tell someone approaching the door that the women inside were naked. “Mr Trump just barged right in, didn’t say anything, stood there and stared at us,” she recalled. Trump’s attitude, she said, seemed to be: “I can do this because I can.” “He didn’t walk in and say, ‘Oh, I’m so sorry, I was looking for someone,’” she continued. “He walked in, he stood and he stared. He was doing it because he knew that he could.” The alleged incident happened in her shared dressing room behind the stage at the Genesis convention center in Gary, Indiana. The woman – who did not wish to be identified – is the second competitor from the 2001 Miss USA pageant to claim that Trump took advantage of owning the pageant, which he broadcast on NBC, in order to view the contestants naked. A torrent of sexual misconduct accusations have followed Trump throughout his run for president. But a 2005 tape of Trump bragging that his fame allowed him to grope and kiss women without their consent has inspired even more women to come forward with stories of his impropriety. On Wednesday evening, the New York Times published the accounts of two women who claim Trump groped or kissed them without their permission. This is contrary to Trump’s claim, in Sunday night’s debate with Hillary Clinton, that he never acted on his boasts. “I wanted to punch the screen,” Jessica Leeds, who said Trump had groped her on a plane three decades ago, told the paper. “He was like an octopus. His hands were everywhere.” Rachel Crooks was a 22-year-old receptionist in 2005 when, she said, Trump kissed her on the mouth when she introduced herself to him. “It was so inappropriate,” Crooks told the Times. “I was so upset that he thought I was so insignificant that he could do that.” Trump angrily denied both accusations.  ‘Waltzing in’  The other 2001 beauty contestant to accuse Trump of misconduct was Tasha Dixon. In an interview with CBS of Los Angeles, Dixon, the former Miss Arizona, recalled an incident in which Trump came “waltzing in” to a room while a number of the contestants were half naked or undressed.   Dixon was describing a separate incident to the one detailed to Guardian US by the other contestant. . The contestant declined to speak using her name because she lives in a conservative area and wishes to protect her family’s privacy. The Guardian corroborated the former contestant’s story with another contestant who became her friend during the 2001 pageant. The other contestant confirmed that the Guardian’s source told her about the incident at the pageant site in 2001 shortly after it occurred. A second woman who was sharing the dressing room with the Guardian’s source when Trump allegedly barged in did not respond to several emails requesting interviews.   Trump owned the Miss Universe family of pageants, to which Miss USA belonged, from 1996 to 2005. The first contestant to win Miss Universe under Trump’s ownership was Alicia Machado – famously name-checked by Hillary Clinton during the first presidential debate, who said Trump had called Machado “Miss Piggy” and “Miss Housekeeping”, a dig at her Latina heritage.   Trump has boasted in the past, during a 2005 segment of the Howard Stern show, about being able to view beauty contestants naked. “I’ll go backstage before a show, and everyone’s getting dressed and ready and everything else,” he said, in a tape obtained by CNN. “And you know, no men are anywhere. And I’m allowed to go in because I’m the owner of the pageant. And therefore I’m inspecting it. ‘Is everyone OK?’ You know, they’re standing there with no clothes. And you see these incredible-looking women. And so I sort of get away with things like that.” Dixon, the other Miss USA 2001 competitor who has spoken out, said many of the contestants’ very first encounter with Trump occurred while many of them were naked. “He just came strolling right in,” she said. “There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything. Some girls were topless. “We were naked or half naked in a very physically vulnerable position,” she continued. “And then to have the pressure of the people that worked for him telling us to go fawn all over him, go walk up to him, talk to him, get his attention.” Separately, Buzzfeed reported on Wednesday that several teen beauty queens from the 1997 Miss Teen USA said Trump entered a communal dressing room while several of them were naked. One girl was 15 years old at the time. Another Miss USA contestant from 2001 who spoke to the Guardian did not recall Trump showing inappropriate behavior. She recalled Trump being backstage, she said, but only on the evening that the pageant was nationally televised. “The chaperones made announcements that he was there & would be coming into the dressing room,” the former contestant, who wished to remain anonymous, wrote in an email. “They gave us all a heads up, it was also very close to the pageant starting & very brief. I would imagine that most, if not all contestants were already, or at least should have been, dressed to compete.” The contestant remembered Trump standing in the doorway and wishing them good luck and said he did not “parade” through the room. “I am not endorsing anyone, but giving an honest account of meeting Mr Trump,” she said. The contestant who accused Trump of bursting into her dressing room acknowledged that not every contestant had negative experiences with Trump. She did not report Trump’s behavior at the time, she said, because her position was too tenuous. “This was my boss. I’m there to represent my state, my town, my reputation on one of the most prestigious stages on the planet,” she said. “I had not a lot of experience under my belt. And it was horrifying … It was extremely uncomfortable from there forward.” Until she saw Dixon’s interview, she thought that she and the other woman in the dressing room were Trump’s only targets. “It’s important for people to know that this has been a personality trait of his for a long time,” she said, explaining her motivation for speaking out. “He completely exerted his power and the control that he had … And I do believe that kind of behavior perpetuates rape culture and makes young boys think they can behave that way.” Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.  \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump on Thursday joked to a group of evangelicals that he won’t get into heaven if he loses the presidential election.\\nSpeaking at an event hosted by the Christian group American Renewal Project in Kissimmee, Fla., Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, asked the group to pray for him and do whatever else they could to help him defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in November.\\n{mosads}“This will be an election that will go down in the history books for the evangelicals, for the Christians, for everybody of religion.

The Republican presidential frontrunner’s interactions with protesters are unlike anything typically seen from politicians, with the candidate firing up the crowd, calling them \"troublemakers\" and yelling his trademark “Get them out of here!” In a number of cases, Trump has appeared to praise supporters for attacking protesters and even said that he wanted to punch one of them in the face himself during a rally in Las Vegas last month. Donald Trump\\'s campaign did not immediately return ABC News\\' request for comment. At a rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina yesterday, Trump was interrupted several times by different protesters -- or “professional troublemakers” as he refers to them. Trump recalled an earlier incident when \"some rough guys\" “started punching back” as a protester started swinging. “It was a beautiful thing,” Trump said of the crowd springing into action to quiet a protester. During the event, a rallier, John Franklin McGraw, allegedly punched a protester who was being escorted out in the head and face. The Cumberland County Sheriff\\'s Department said that its deputies did not witness the incident and did not immediately arrest McGraw. He was charged this morning with assault after video of the incident surfaced. \"We obviously discourage this kind of behavior and take significant measures to ensure the safety of any and all attendees,\" Trump\\'s campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement released tonight. Yesterday, at the North Carolina rally, Trump also reminisced about the “good ol\\' days” when protesters were treated “very, very rough” for speaking out. According to Trump, nowadays protesters can “get away with murder.” At a Las Vegas rally back in Feb. 22, Trump said he’d like to punch a protester in the face. “Here\\'s a guy throwing punches, nasty as hell, screaming at everything else when we\\'re talking...He\\'s walking out with big high-fives, smiling, laughing. I\\'d like to punch him in the face,” Trump said. Trump also said: “You know what I hate? There\\'s a guy -- totally disruptive, throwing punches. We\\'re not allowed to punch back anymore. I love the old days. You know what they used to do guys like that in a place like this? They would be carried out in a stretcher, folks. True.” When a protester interrupted his March 4 campaign rally in Warren, Michigan, Trump suggested he’d defend his supporters in court. “Get him out. Try not to hurt him. If you do, I’ll defend you in court. Don\\'t worry about it,” Trump said at the rally, in Michigan. And during a Feb. 1 rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Trump promised he’d pay for the legal fees if someone “knock[ed] the crap out of” anyone who throws a tomato. Trump typically attracts thousands of people at his rallies. “We will have these little interruptions. When you have 35,000 people, if you have a few protesters, I guess that has to happen, right” Trump said at a rally Madison Alabama February 29, 2016. (The Madison, Alabama fire department told ABC News they estimate the crowd was closer to 15,000 people.) “Is a Trump rally the most fun? Seriously. Right? “ Trump said at a rally in Columbus Ohio on March 1, adding, “I love my protesters, we love our protesters right?” There have been some instances when Trump and his campaign appeared to take the opposite stance. According to local station WLKY, Trump insisted the crowd at his Louisville, Kentucky rally on Super Tuesday leave a protester unharmed: “Don’t hurt him! Don’t hurt him!” he said. “See, if I say, ‘Go get him,’ I get in trouble with the press, the most dishonest people in the world,” he said. And after a video appeared to show a protester being kicked by ralliers in Birmingham, Alabama, last November, Trump\\'s press secretary, Hope Hicks, denounced the violence. \"The campaign does not condone this behavior,\" Hicks said.  ABC News’ John Santucci contributed to this report.         Trump Says He Could \\'Shoot Somebody\\' and Still Maintain Support \"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, okay, and I wouldn\\'t lose any voters, okay?\"         Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at The Wright Place while campaigning in Norwalk, Iowa, January 20, 2016.

BERNSTEIN / Reuters      Jan. 23, 2016, 7:16 PM UTC\\xa0/\\xa0Updated\\xa0Jan. 23, 2016, 7:16 PM UTC        Donald Trump said Saturday that his supporters are so loyal that he would not lose backers even if he were to shoot someone in the middle of downtown Manhattan. \"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, okay, and I wouldn\\'t lose any voters, okay?\" Trump said at a rally in Sioux Center, Iowa as the audience laughed. \"It\\'s, like, incredible.\" Trump has previously boasted about the devotion of his fans, but the new comment is the most extreme example of such a remark. A recent NBC News/Survey Monkey poll suggested that Trump supporters, once decided, are likely to stay with him. About half of respondents backing the real estate mogul said they were \"absolutely certain\" that they will vote for Trump.     Ali Vitali       Ali Vitali is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News, based in Washington.         Donald Trump made these remarks Sunday about violence at his rallies in response to questions by John Dickerson on CBS’ Face the Nation  :  “First of all, with all of the rallies I have had ... you haven’t seen one person even injured at one of our rallies. And the cases you’re talking about, the one (protester) was a bad dude, he was swinging, he was hitting people, he was a very bad guy, and the police came in and they really were very effective. And frankly, some of the audience members had no choice but to be effective, and I didn’t mind that at all. Or they would have been hurt, frankly. ... I don’t condone violence, and I don’t condone what (my supporter in North Carolina who punched a protester) did because he got carried away, and it’s very unfortunate. But this kid was walking out, and I understand he had a certain finger up in the air as he’s walking out, and this man became very angry. And you know what, again, I don’t condone violence, but the kid shouldn’t have had the finger up in the air either, OK, if that’s what he did. So I’m going to take a look at the tape, and I’ll let you know (whether I’d consider paying the supporter’s legal fees). These people are disrupters. They’re not protesters. They’re disrupters. They’re professional disrupters in some cases. But that’s all they do. They stand up and they disrupt. ... But if they ever went to (Bernie Sanders’) rallies and did the same thing, I want to tell you, you would be so angry with me. Nobody talks about it, but you would be so against me. It’s a whole different standard when it comes to a Republican conservative vs. a liberal.  Trump, puncher in chief: Our view  If people went to their rallies and disrupted their rallies, like my rallies are disrupted, the press would stick up for them and would make all sorts of excuses about how terrible it is. So we have two standards in this country. ... I see people in the audience that I don’t think they have a great future. I think they’re disrupters. I think they are not in love with our country. I think they protest and they disrupt. That’s what they do. I don’t know if they do it for a living. I don’t know if they get paid for doing it. But they are not good people, and they are certainly not good for our country. ... I’m constantly saying to the police, don’t hurt them, don’t hurt them. I don’t condone violence, but some of these people are violent.” <div><div>\\n<article>\\n<div>\\n<p>Donald Trump, who has built an entire presidential campaign around racism and xenophobia, admitted he intentionally will say provocative or outrageous comments just to keep his audiences interested.</p>\\n<p>Trump explained his art to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180503073019/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/opinion/sunday/a-chance-to-reset-the-republican-race.html?ref=opinion\">The New York Times editorial board</a>, telling them that when he sees people at one of his rallies he just throws out a line that he knows will get them riled up.</p>\\n<p>\"If it gets a little boring, if I see people starting to sort of, maybe thinking about leaving, I can sort of tell the audience, I just say, ‘We will build the wall!’ and they go nuts,” he told the Times\\' editorial board.</p>\\n<p>Throwing out red meat to rile up base supporters is <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180503073019/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/howard-dean-discusses-presidential-bid_us_5693bb31e4b0a2b6fb70c66a\">nothing new for politicians from either party</a>.

Published Oct. 12, 2016   On an April 11, 2005, Howard Stern show, Donald Trump bragged about some of the special perks he enjoyed while owner of the Miss USA pageant. They came not in a locker room but a dressing room. \"I\\'ll go backstage before a show and everyone\\'s getting dressed and ready and everything else,\" he said. \"And you know, no men are anywhere. And I\\'m allowed to go in because I\\'m the owner of the pageant. And therefore I\\'m inspecting it.\"    RELATED:  Trump campaigns in Florida today  Said Stern: \"You\\'re like a doctor.\" Responded Trump: \"Is everyone okay? You know they\\'re standing there with no clothes. And you see these incredible looking women. And so I sort of get away with things like that.\" CBS 2 Los Angeles did a little fact checking and, guess what, this time, no Pinocchios. Tasha Dixon, Miss Arizona of 2001,  told the station that Trump just came \"waltzing in\"  while contestants were nude or half-nude as they changed into bikinis. Separately, Buzzfeed reported early Wednesday that four women in the 1997 Miss Teen USA beauty pageant said he walked into their dressing room while they were changing. Some were as young as 15, Buzzfeed said. Three spoke anonymously and one allowed her name to be used. \"I remember putting on my dress really quick because I was like, \\'Oh my god, there\\'s a man in here,\\'\" Mariah Billado, a former Miss Vermont Teen USA told Buzzfeed. According to Tasha Dixon, Miss Arizona of 2001, there was more inspecting than doctoring. In an interview with the station, she described her experience with Trump as a contestant that year in a dressing room where she and others were changing into bikinis: \"He just came strolling right in. There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything. Some girls were topless. Others girls were naked. \"Our first introduction to him was when we were at the dress rehearsal and half naked changing into our bikinis. \"To have the owner come waltzing in, when we\\'re naked, or half naked, in a very physically vulnerable position and then to have the pressure of the people that worked for him telling us to go fawn all over him, go walk up to him, talk to him, get his attention.\" She suggested that such opportunities were among the reasons Trump owned beauty pageants. \"I\\'m telling you Donald Trump owned the pageant for the reasons to utilize his power to get around beautiful women. Who do you complain to? He owns the pageant. There\\'s no one to complain to. Everyone there works for him.\"   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAP Photo\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n2016 \\n\\nPeople who know him well are starting to ask: Can he focus enough to run the Oval Office?\\n\\n\\n\\nContinue to article content  \\nIn the late 1980s, Jack Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell, one of Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s Atlantic City casino executives, devised a special strategy for talking to the in-and-out owner. â\\x80\\x9cI would know Donald was coming to town,â\\x80\\x9d Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell said in a recent interview from his home in Arizona. â\\x80\\x9cAnd if you were going to pitch him something, you would sayâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94and here he sped up his cadence, as if he were hitting a verbal fast-forward buttonâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Oh-hey-Donald-good-to-see-you-hey-I-wanted-to-run-something-by-you.â\\x80\\x99 Boom. That was it. Because if you hit him too late in the conversation, he might say, â\\x80\\x98Letâ\\x80\\x99s talk about it laterâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94and he was gone.â\\x80\\x9d\\nIn the early â\\x80\\x9890s, Barbara Res, a project manager on Trump Tower who was a vice president in the Trump Organization, attempted to prepare him for a deposition for a court case pitting a Trump-led group against the Los Angeles school district in a battle for a coveted piece of property. â\\x80\\x9cHe said, â\\x80\\x98No, I donâ\\x80\\x99t need to be prepared,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Res said last week from her home in New Jersey. Finally, she persuaded him to give her, an associate and an attorney two hours in his office. â\\x80\\x9cIn the two hours, he kept taking phone calls,â\\x80\\x9d Res said. Unprepared, he did â\\x80\\x9cpoorlyâ\\x80\\x9d in the deposition, she said; his group lost the case, and the deal fell apart. â\\x80\\x9cHe was so distracted,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cHe really couldnâ\\x80\\x99t stay focused.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI think heâ\\x80\\x99s definitely got attention deficit disorder,â\\x80\\x9d said Trump biographer Michael Dâ\\x80\\x99Antonio, who interviewed Trump five times for a total of eight hours and found himself frustrated trying to get him to concentrate on answers to questions about his parents, his childhood, just about anything. â\\x80\\x9cThat doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean he isnâ\\x80\\x99t really smartâ\\x80\\x94it just means heâ\\x80\\x99s not at his best when heâ\\x80\\x99s asked to dwell on a topic.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThe question of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s attention span recently has leapt from a longtime employee complaint to a meaningful national issue. Res, Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell and others like them have long collected stories of their exasperation over Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s impetuous nature as a boss. But this one personal attribute has become a subject of more widespread concern as voters consider how Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s habits and personality might translate to the presidencyâ\\x80\\x94a job that demands uncommon focus, with life in the West Wing often feeling like a control panel of perpetually blinking emergency lights.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is hard to fathom the scope of material a president has to handle on a daily basis or the velocity at which it comes until you see it firsthand,â\\x80\\x9d said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Obama, who described a work environment in which the demands are severe and ample attention span is a must.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have to be patient. You have to listen. You have to ask the right questions. All of those things require great discipline,â\\x80\\x9d presidential historian Mark Updegrove said.\\nSome people who have been close to Trump have started to sound alarms. In July, Tony Schwartz, who spent a year and a half with him as the ghostwriter for his best-selling The Art of the Deal in 1987, said the fact that Trump â\\x80\\x9chas no attention spanâ\\x80\\x9d should be an â\\x80\\x9cexplicitâ\\x80\\x9d issue in the current election. Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell, who put out a tell-all book in 1991 but had kept quiet since then up until recently, wrote last month in his local paper that heâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9chorrifiedâ\\x80\\x9d by the possibility of a President Trump partly because Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cattention span was so small it was almost impossible to have a strategic conversation with him.â\\x80\\x9d\\nTrump himself hasnâ\\x80\\x99t exactly put these fears to rest with recent remarks. He told reporters from the Washington Post he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t like to read long reports (â\\x80\\x9cI want it shortâ\\x80\\x9d), and he said on MSNBC heâ\\x80\\x99s not overly worried about readying for the upcoming debates against assiduous policy wonk Hillary Clinton (â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve seen people do so much prep work when they get out there, they canâ\\x80\\x99t speakâ\\x80\\x9d).\\nElection Day is two months out. If Trump loses, many observers will cite his errant, frenetic campaignâ\\x80\\x94a constantly changing whistle-stop operation whose inconsistency has come as no surprise to many who have known him and worked with him over the course of his business career. And if he wins, the Oval Office will have an occupant whoâ\\x80\\x94at least according to Schwartzâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9chas the attention span of a 9-year-old with ADHD.â\\x80\\x9d\\n***\\n How long is Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s attention span? Over the years, Trump has discussed this topic, actually, a surprising amountâ\\x80\\x94and, not so surprisingly, inconsistently.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I mean, I have an attention span thatâ\\x80\\x99s as long as it has to be,â\\x80\\x9d Trump told Time last year.\\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s not exactly what heâ\\x80\\x99s said in the past.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy attention span is short,â\\x80\\x9d he flatly declared in 1990 in his book Surviving at the Top.\\nAnd in 2004, in Think Like a Billionaire, he wrote that â\\x80\\x9cmost successful people have very short attention spans.â\\x80\\x9d\\nParsing the decades-long public record of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s own thoughts on his mental habits is a challenge. As with many of his positions, if he has said something, chances are high that he has said the opposite, too.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne of the keys to thinking big is total focus,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote (through Schwartz) in The Art of the Deal. â\\x80\\x9cI think of it almost as a controlled neurosis â\\x80¦ â\\x80\\x9d\\nIn 2008, in Never Give Up, he augmented his thoughts on this â\\x80\\x9ccontrolled neurosisâ\\x80\\x9d by preaching the value of laser focus on just one thing. â\\x80\\x9cIn this age of multitasking, this is a valuable technique to acquire,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nThe following year, though, in Think Like a Champion, he offered up somewhat different advice, saying it â\\x80\\x9chelps to be thinking of two things at once.â\\x80\\x9d He added, â\\x80\\x9cI always try to keep two wavelengths going at once, which prevents brain cramps and reminds me that Iâ\\x80\\x99m destined for success.â\\x80\\x9d \\nOne of the keys to thinking big is total focus,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote (through Schwartz) in The Art of the Deal. â\\x80\\x9cI think of it almost as a controlled neurosis â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOne of the most recurrent notes in the oeuvre of Trump is the Tao of speed. â\\x80\\x9cKeep it short, fast, and direct,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote in 2004 in How to Get Rich. â\\x80\\x9cSometimes people are surprised by how quickly I make big decisions, but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve learned to trust my instincts and not to overthink things,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote the same year in Think Like a Billionaire. â\\x80\\x9cThe day I realized it can be smart to be shallow was, for me, a deep experience.â\\x80\\x9d\\nHe prides himself on not engaging deeply with material if he can avoid it. â\\x80\\x9cExtensive meetings and interviews are often a waste of time,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote in 2007 in Think Big. â\\x80\\x9cExtraneous information in long-winded presentations is like junk mail. Everyone hates junk mail,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote the same year in a book literally called Trump 101. â\\x80\\x9cJust dive in,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote the next year in Never Give Up. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t give yourself time to doubt.â\\x80\\x9d\\nHe plays golf, partly to relax, he has saidâ\\x80\\x94but he also plays it fast, zipping around his courses in a cart and parking where he pleases. When he played with sportswriter Rick Reilly, they raced through 18 holes in barely more than three hours, â\\x80\\x9cand that,â\\x80\\x9d Reilly wrote, included â\\x80\\x9cstopping often to harangue the stonemason, the path paver, and the greenskeeper to redo the bricks, or retrim a tree, or repave a path that is not absolutely, immaculately Trumpalicious.â\\x80\\x9d\\nHe plays tennis fast, too, or played it fast, until his instructor urged him to play a tad more slowâ\\x80\\x94to not try to hit a smash every single shotâ\\x80\\x94at which point Trump quit. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t have the patience for it,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nAnd he keeps three phones in his limousine, he told Reilly, â\\x80\\x9cso I can be going fucking crazy on them.â\\x80\\x9d\\nIn the life of Trump, a major through-line is this self-evident frenzy, over which he seems to have little to no control. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a fitful sleeper. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a pell-mell manager. And the things heâ\\x80\\x99s said about focusing, and heâ\\x80\\x99s said many, many things about focusing, in his books and beyond, ultimately pile up to sound less like self-help tips for fans and devotees than reminders to himself.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStay focused,â\\x80\\x9d he tweeted on May 19, 2014.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStay focused,â\\x80\\x9d he tweeted on July 1, 2014.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStay focused,â\\x80\\x9d he tweeted on August 5, 2014.\\n***\\n Itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to say how this would work in the White House. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cI remember the day in 2009 that the president made his decision on the auto intervention,â\\x80\\x9d Axelrod, the Obama adviser, wrote to me in an email. The day started with an intelligence briefing on North Korea. Then there was a meeting about the auto industry bailout. Then there was a town hall meeting on the economy. Then there were meetings in the situation room about Afghanistan and Iraq. Then there was another meeting about the bailout. Then came news of devastating floods in North Dakota. â\\x80\\x9cThat is life in the White House,â\\x80\\x9d Axelrod said, â\\x80\\x9cand to be effective, a president has to have read his briefs thoroughly and given thought to each subject.â\\x80\\x9d\\nTrump said to the aforementioned Post reporters he prefers to be briefed verbally and quickly rather than in the form of reports running hundreds of pages. â\\x80\\x9cSend me, like, three pages,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Reading briefings, books, biographies of presidents, he said, takes time he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t have much time. I have so little time.â\\x80\\x9d\\nNot every president, of course, has been a bookworm or so intellectually inclined, but Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s aggressive conviction that he can do what he needs to do and make the decisions he needs to make â\\x80\\x9cwith very little knowledge other than the knowledgeâ\\x80\\x9d he already has would make him an abnormal presidentâ\\x80\\x94in particular in comparison with the current president, a reader by disposition and a lawyer by training who stays up late plowing through â\\x80\\x9can insane amount of paper.â\\x80\\x9d \\nSend me, like, three pages,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Reading briefings, books, biographies of presidents, he said, takes time he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have.\\n\\nRegardless of how a president prefers to absorb information, though, the job is incredibly cognitively demanding, said David Greenberg, a presidential historian. Since the rise of the United States as a superpower, he explained, â\\x80\\x9cthere are on any given day a dozen major issues around the world that might need his attention. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt requires self-confidence. It requires knowing oneself. It requires knowing when to make decisions and when to delegate. These are rare qualities to have in abundance,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s one of the reasons we havenâ\\x80\\x99t had that many truly great presidents.â\\x80\\x9d\\nIn modern, post-World War II American history, there have been different kinds of presidents, naturallyâ\\x80\\x94micromanaging presidents (Jimmy Carter leads this category) and macro-managing presidents (Ronald Reagan). LBJ, said presidential historian Updegrove, was â\\x80\\x9ca rampant micromanager,â\\x80\\x9d but that styleâ\\x80\\x94unlike for, say, Carterâ\\x80\\x94worked for him. â\\x80\\x9cIn his case,â\\x80\\x9d Updegrove explained, â\\x80\\x9cmicromanagement was necessary in getting his very ambitious legislative agenda through Congress.â\\x80\\x9d Even George W. Bush, definitely more macro than micro, Updegrove said, â\\x80\\x9cstill read volumes of material every night.â\\x80\\x9d And while Reagan was big-picture, he had a set of capable advisers he trusted and relied on to drill down on detailsâ\\x80\\x94both question marks for Trump in his campaign, with his schizoid tactics and reeling whirl of strategists and campaign managers.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne of the core skills a candidate must possess is the ability to address many different types of activities â\\x80¦ and simultaneously be prepared to go deep and thoughtful if an issue unexpectedly arises during the campaign,â\\x80\\x9d said Beth Myers, one of Mitt Romneyâ\\x80\\x99s lead advisers during his 2012 presidential run. â\\x80\\x9cThe ability to perform these many diverse tasks well and also be able to think through and articulate difficult policy issues requires a very facile intelligence and an unusual talent for being able to keep many ideas at top of mind.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThe careening Trump campaign, and the prospect of a President Trump, has made Res, Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell and Dâ\\x80\\x99Antonio think back on their interactions with the man.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf he were elected president and he had a set of policies he wanted to pursue,â\\x80\\x9d Dâ\\x80\\x99Antonio said, â\\x80\\x9cI think he could do itâ\\x80\\x94but he would have to consider them his personal priorities. And I think people around him would have to figure out a way to frame those challenges in a way that would get him to engage.â\\x80\\x9d\\nWhich would be?\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt would have to appeal to his ego,â\\x80\\x9d Dâ\\x80\\x99Antonio continued. â\\x80\\x9cIf it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t engage him in that way, heâ\\x80\\x99s not very interested.â\\x80\\x9d\\nDâ\\x80\\x99Antonio remembered finally getting Trump to talk with a modicum of attentiveness about a detail from his time as a teenager at New York Military Academyâ\\x80\\x94the first time his name appeared in the local newspaper. â\\x80\\x9cTrump Wins Game for NYMA,â\\x80\\x9d the headline read. â\\x80\\x9cI thought it was amazing,â\\x80\\x9d Trump told Dâ\\x80\\x99Antonio.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt just drove home for me,â\\x80\\x9d Dâ\\x80\\x99Antonio said, â\\x80\\x9chow everything is so self-referential to him. This need for affirmation is his big motivator. It is the thing that focuses his mind.â\\x80\\x9d\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s perhaps not the only thing, said Tim Oâ\\x80\\x99Brien, another Trump biographer. â\\x80\\x9cHe loves things that give him instant gratification: food, sex, cash-heavy, front-loaded business deals,â\\x80\\x9d Oâ\\x80\\x99Brien said. The flip side: â\\x80\\x9cHe doesnâ\\x80\\x99t read, doesnâ\\x80\\x99t strategize, has few deep relationships with people.â\\x80\\x9d\\nBefore Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell worked for Trump in Atlantic City, he worked for Steve Wynn, a casino magnate who at one time was a prime Trump competitor in the gaming industry but in the end was more successful. Going from working for Wynn to working for Trump, Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell said, made for a jarring contrast.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGodâ\\x80\\x99s honest truth, I had eight-, nine-hour meetings with Steve Wynn, one on one, because he wanted to pick your brain,â\\x80\\x9d Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell said. â\\x80\\x9cHe wanted to talk nitty-gritty details. Marketing. Schedules. Entertainers.â\\x80\\x9d\\nTrump, on the other hand, Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell said, wanted to know how long a meeting would take. Meetings with Trump typically lasted 10, maybe 15 minutes. â\\x80\\x9cHe would talk for a few minutes and then change the subject,â\\x80\\x9d Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell said. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think he has the capacity to listen.â\\x80\\x9d\\nIn the casino business, the house always winsâ\\x80\\x94at least over time. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s casinos struggled for a variety of reasonsâ\\x80\\x94at the top of that list is how heavily leveraged they wereâ\\x80\\x94but the impulsivity of their owner didnâ\\x80\\x99t help, according to Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell.\\nWhen it comes to Trump as president? â\\x80\\x9cQuite frankly,â\\x80\\x9d said Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a frightening scenario for me.â\\x80\\x9d\\nFor Res, what Trump has said about the forthcoming debatesâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cI believe you can prep too much for those things,â\\x80\\x9d he told the New York Times last monthâ\\x80\\x94conjured up the long-ago experience with his deposition for the lost Los Angeles court case.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want to spend any more than a small amount of time on any one thing, and then he wants to move on,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cHe doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want to hear the long explanation. He says, â\\x80\\x98I got it.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\nMaybe he does. But maybe he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf he gets it, he gets it,â\\x80\\x9d Res said. â\\x80\\x9cIf he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t, youâ\\x80\\x99re fucked.â\\x80\\x9d\\n  \\nThe New York Times: Digital and Home Delivery Subscriptions\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Offer for a New York Times News subscription; current subscribers not eligible.

A team from Carnegie Mellon University analyzed the speeches of many current presidential candidates and found Trump\\'s grammar skills to be akin to those of a 6th grader.   SEE ALSO: Think gas taxes are high? Check out these state beer fees   Addresses used in the study ranged from candidacy declarations to concession and victory announcements.  Trump came out a bit better when the talks were assessed based on vocabulary. In the study, the researchers note, \"The candidates\\' speeches mostly went from seventh grade level for Donald Trump to tenth grade level for Bernie Sanders.\" Maxine Eskenazi, one of the team members also acknowledged, \"Assessing the readability of campaign speeches is a little tricky because most measures are geared to the written word, yet text is very different from the spoken word.\"    Everything seems to sparkle here at the Mar-a-Lago estate on a recent afternoon. The sun glints off the pool and off the black Secret Service SUVs in the circular driveway. Palm trees rustle in a warm breeze, croquet balls click, and a security guard stands at the entrance to Donald Trump’s private living quarters. “You can always tell when the king is here,” Trump’s longtime butler here, Anthony Senecal, says of the master of the house, a Republican presidential candidate. The king is returning today to his Versailles, a snowbird’s paradise that will become a winter White House if he is elected president. Mar-a-Lago, with its 118 rooms, is where the Donald comes to escape, entertain and luxuriate in a Mediterranean-style manse, built 90 years ago by wealthy cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post.    Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, a Mediterranean-style mansion with 118 rooms, in Palm Beach, Florida. Photograph: Eric Thayer/New York Times   Few people here can anticipate Trump’s demands and desires better than Senecal, who is 74. He has worked at the property for nearly 60 years, and for Trump for nearly 30 of them. He understands Trump’s sleeping patterns and how he likes his steak (“It would rock on the plate, it was so well done”), and how Trump insists – despite the hair salon on the premises – on doing his own hair. Senecal knows how to stroke Trump\\'s ego and lift his spirits, like the time years ago he received a warning from Trump\\'s soon-to-land plane that the mogul was in a sour mood. Senecal quickly hired a bugler to play Hail to the Chief as Trump stepped out of his limousine. Most days, though, Senecal greets Trump with little fanfare, taking the suit he arrives in to be pressed in the basement\\'s full-service laundry. The next morning, before dawn and after about four hours\\' sleep, Trump will meet him at the arched entrance of his private quarters to accept a bundle of newspapers, including the New York Times, the Daily News and the New York Post, as well as the Palm Beach papers. Trump will emerge hours later, in khakis, a white golf shirt and baseball cap. If the cap is white, the staff has noticed, the boss is in a good mood. If it is red, well, it’s best to stay away. Retire, expire Senecal tried to retire in 2009, but Trump decided he was irreplaceable, so while Senecal was officially relieved of his butler duties, he has been kept around as a kind of unofficial historian at Mar-a-Lago. “Tony, to retire is to expire,” Trump told him. “I’ll see you next season.” Senecal, with horn-rimmed glasses, a walrus moustache and a white pocket kerchief in his black jacket, seems to reflect his boss’s worldview. He worries about attacks by Islamic terrorists and is critical of Trump’s ex-wives. And, like the man himself, Senecal is at ease among the celebrities who visit the estate. The butler’s up-close observations of Trump over the years have revealed not only the mogul’s quirks (Trump rarely appears in bathing trunks, for example, and does not like to swim) but also his habitual, self-soothing exaggerations. In the early years, Trump\\'s daughter Ivanka slept in the same children\\'s suite that Dina Merrill, an actor and a daughter of Post, occupied in the 1930s. Trump liked to tell guests that the nursery-rhyme-themed tiles in the room were made by a young Walt Disney. “You don’t like that, do you?” Trump would say when he caught Senecal rolling his eyes. The house historian would protest that it was not true. “Who cares?” Trump would respond with a laugh. Trump is abundantly proud of his ability to drive a golf ball, once asking rhetorically during a news conference: “Do I hit it long? Is Trump strong?” Senecal suggested that Trump was perhaps not quite as strong as he imagined, remembering times they would hit balls together from the Mar-a-Lago property into the Intracoastal Waterway. “Tony, how far is that?” Trump would ask. “It’s, like, 275 yards,” Senecal would respond, though he says the actual distance is 225 yards. Still, Senecal says Trump can be generous when the mood strikes him, sometimes peeling $100 bills from a wad to give to the groundskeepers, whom Senecal describes as appreciative. “You’re a Hispanic and you’re in here trimming the trees and everything, and a guy walks up and hands you $100,” Senecal says. “And they love him, not for that, they just love him.” When she died, in 1973, Marjorie Post left the house to the US government with the intent that it would become a presidential retreat. But the upkeep proved too expensive, and ownership was transferred back to Post’s daughters, who unloaded it to Trump for less than $10 million in 1985. He turned it into a private club a decade later. These days, what really seems to bug Trump is the sound of planes over the property. The continual roar of engines “drives him nuts,” Senecal says. “Tony!” Trump would often shout. “Call the tower!” So the candidate is suing the county-run airport. He has also sued the town in a dispute over the size of his estate’s flagpole; the size of the banquet hall he added to the property; and the size of the club, which, to frighten the local gentry, he once threatened to sell to followers of the Rev Sun Myung Moon. Controversy  More recently, Mar-a-Lago has set off controversy in the Republican primary, as Trump was criticised by rivals for hiring employees from abroad to staff the club rather than relying on the local workforce. “There are a lot of Romanians, there’s a lot of South Africans. We have one Irishman,” Senecal says of the staff, before echoing Trump’s defence that locals shun the short-term seasonal work. “They’re so good,” he says of the foreigners “They are so professional. These local people . . . ” he trails off, making a disapproving face. Over the decades, Senecal has grown close to the Trump family. He recalls how Trump’s father, Fred, once stepped out of his limo on the club’s gravel driveway and remarked to Senecal: “Somebody better get that coin.” The butler went on his hands and knees and after a few minutes found a crusty penny. “His eyes were incredible,” Senecal says of Fred Trump. “Mr Trump has the same eyes.” He also remembers Donald’s sons running through the library, panelled with centuries-old British oak and filled with rare first-edition books that no one in the family ever read. When the library became a bar, Trump put up a portrait of himself, posing in tennis whites. “I’ve been in other homes in Palm Beach: same exact painting,” Senecal confides archly. “Just a different head.” Senecal says he adored the Trump children, but found Ivana, Trump’s first wife, a demanding presence. She would instruct him to “get that spot out of that rug” and then do it herself if he failed. She would occasionally tell Senecal to have the gardeners go inside because she wanted to swim naked in the pool. Senecal took a sabbatical in 1990 to become the mayor of a town in West Virginia, where he gained some notoriety for a proposal requiring all panhandlers to carry begging permits. He says Trump wrote to him, \"This is so great, Tony.\" Senecal returned in 1992 and took up his old butler’s residence, but was soon asked to move out after Trump married Marla Maples, who “really didn’t belong here,” Senecal says. Also, Trump wanted to rent the room out to club members. A decade later, Trump put his own imprint on Mar-a-Lago by building the 20,000sq ft Donald J Trump Ballroom. The venue made its big debut with the 2005 wedding of Trump to the former Melania Knavs, whom Senecal described as exceptionally compassionate. Senecal greeted guests, including Hillary Clinton, at the door. (He offers a profane description of the Democratic presidential front-runner.) Senecal’s admiration for his longtime boss seems to know few limits. On March 6th, as Trump made his way through the living room on his way to the golf course, Senecal called out “All rise” to the club members and staff. They rose. Trump was wearing a “Make America Great Again” cap. It was white, not red. He seemed to be in a good mood. – (New York Times service)   During the Atlantic City casino boom in the 1980s, Philadelphia cabinet-builder Edward Friel Jr. landed a $400,000 contract to build the bases for slot machines, registration desks, bars and other cabinets at Harrah\\'s at Trump Plaza. The family cabinetry business, founded in the 1940s by Edward\\'s father, finished its work in 1984 and submitted its final bill to the general contractor for the Trump Organization, the resort\\'s builder. Edward\\'s son, Paul, who was the firm\\'s accountant, still remembers the amount of that bill more than 30 years later: $83,600. The reason? The money never came. \\'That began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company...which has been around since my grandfather,\\' he said. Donald Trump often portrays himself as a savior of the working class who will \\'protect your job.\\' But a USA TODAY NETWORK analysis found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades — and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans, like the Friels, who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them. At least 60 lawsuits, along with hundreds of liens, judgments and other government filings reviewed by USA TODAY NETWORK, document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work. Among them: a dishwasher in Florida. A glass company in New Jersey. Painters. Waiters and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs. Real estate brokers. And, ironically, several law firms that once represented him in these suits and others. Trump\\'s companies also have been cited for 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act since 2005 for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage, according to U.S. Department of Labor data. Those cases were resolved by the companies agreeing to pay back wages. In addition to the lawsuits, the review found more than 200 mechanic\\'s liens — filed by contractors and employees against Trump, his companies or his properties claiming they were owed money for their work — since the 1980s. The liens range from a $75,000 claim by a Plainview, N.Y., air-conditioning and heating company to a $1 million claim from the president of a New York City real estate banking firm. On just one project, the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, records released by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1990 show at least 253 subcontractors weren\\'t paid in full or on time, including workers who installed walls, chandeliers and plumbing. The actions in total paint a portrait of Trump\\'s sprawling organization failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then tying many of them up in court and other negotiations for years. Some give up the fight or settle for less; some ended up out of business. Trump and his daughter Ivanka, in an interview, shrugged off the lawsuits and other claims of nonpayment. If a company or worker he hires isn\\'t paid fully, the Trumps said, it\\'s because The Trump Organization was unhappy with the work. \\'Let\\'s say that they do a job that\\'s not good, or a job that they didn\\'t finish, or a job that was way late. I\\'ll deduct from their contract, absolutely,\\' Trump said. \\'That\\'s what the country should be doing.\\' \\'Visibly winced\\' To be sure, Trump and his companies have prevailed in many legal disputes over missing payments, or reached settlements that cloud the terms reached by the parties. However, the consistent circumstances laid out in those lawsuits and other nonpayment claims raise questions about Trump\\'s judgment as a businessman, and as a potential commander-in-chief. The incidents suggest that either his companies have a poor track record hiring workers and assessing contractors, or that Trump businesses refuse to pay or change payment terms after work is done, as is alleged in dozens of court cases. In the interview, Trump repeatedly said the cases were \\'a long time ago.\\' However, even as he campaigns for the presidency, new cases arise. Last month, Trump Miami Resort Management LLC settled with 48 servers at his Doral golf resort over not getting paid overtime for a special event. The settlements averaged about $800 for each worker and as high as $3,000 for one, according to court records. Some workers put in 20-hour days over the 10-day Passover event at Trump National Doral Miami, the lawsuit contends. Trump\\'s team blamed a contractor, and countersued that contractor. \\'Trump could have settled it right off the bat, but they wanted to fight it out, that\\'s their M.O.\\' said Rod Hannah, of Plantation, Fla., the lawyer who represented the workers, who he said are forbidden from talking about the case in public. \\'They\\'re known for their aggressiveness, and if you have the money, why not?\\' Trump\\'s Doral golf resort also has been embroiled in recent nonpayment claims by two different paint firms, with one case settled and the other pending. Last month, his company\\'s refusal to pay one Florida painter more than $30,000 for work at Doral led the judge in the case to order foreclosure of the resort if the contractor isn\\'t paid. Painter Juan Carlos Enriquez, owner of The Paint Spot, in South Florida, has been waiting more than two years to get paid for his services at Doral. The Paint Spot first filed a lien against Trump\\'s resort, then filed a lawsuit asking a Florida judge to intervene. In courtroom testimony, the manager of the general contractor on Doral\\'s renovation admitted that a decision was made not to pay The Paint Spot because Trump \\'already paid enough.\\' As the construction chief spoke, \\'Trump\\'s trial attorneys visibly winced, began breathing heavily and attempted to make eye contact\\' with the witness, the judge noted in his ruling. That, and other evidence, convinced the judge The Paint Spot\\'s claim was credible. He ordered last month that the Doral resort be foreclosed on, sold, and the proceeds used to pay Enriquez the money he was owed. Trump\\'s attorneys have since filed a motion to delay the sale, and the contest continues. Enriquez still hasn\\'t been paid. Goliath vs. David Trump frequently boasts that he will bring jobs back to America, including Tuesday night in a primary-election victory speech at his golf club in suburban New York City. \\'No matter who you are, we\\'re going to protect your job,\\' Trump said Tuesday. \\'Because let me tell you, our jobs are being stripped from our country like we\\'re babies.\\' But the lawsuits show Trump\\'s organization wages Goliath vs. David legal battles over small amounts of money that are negligible to the billionaire and his executives — but devastating to his much-smaller foes. In 2007, dishwasher Guy Dorcinvil filed a federal lawsuit against Trump\\'s Mar-A-Lago Club resort in Palm Beach, Fla., alleging the club failed to pay time-and-a-half for overtime he worked over three years and the company failed to keep proper time records for employees. Mar-A-Lago LLC agreed to pay Dorcinvil $7,500 to settle the case in 2008. The terms of the agreement includes a statement that Mar-A-Lago does not admit fault and forbids Dorcinvil or his lawyers from talking about the case. Developers with histories of not paying contractors are a small minority, said Colette Nelson, chief advocacy officer of the American Subcontractors Association. But late or missing payments devastate small businesses. \\'Real estate is a tough and aggressive business, but most businesspeople don\\'t set out to make their money by breaking the companies that they do business with,\\' she said, stressing she couldn\\'t speak to Trump\\'s record. \\'But there are a few.\\' In the interview, Trump stressed that complaints represent a tiny fraction of his business empire and dealings with contractors and employees, insisting all are paid fairly. \\'We pay everybody what they\\'re supposed to be paid, and we pay everybody on time,\\' he said. \\'And we employ thousands and thousands of people. OK?\\' The slot-machine cabinets Despite Trump\\'s assertion that his companies refuse payment to contractors only \\'when somebody does a bad job,\\' he has sometimes offered to hire those same contractors again. It\\'s a puzzling turn of events, since most people who have a poor experience with a contractor, and who refuse to pay and even fight the contractor in court, aren\\'t likely to offer to rehire them. Nevertheless, such was the case for the Friels. After submitting the final bill for the Plaza casino cabinet-building in 1984, Paul Friel said he got a call asking that his father, Edward, come to the Trump family\\'s offices at the casino for a meeting. There Edward and other contractors were called in one by one to meet with Donald Trump and his brother, Robert Trump. \\'He sat in a room with nine guys,\\' Paul Friel said. \\'We found out some of them were carpet guys. Some of them were glass guys. Plumbers. You name it.\\' In the meeting, Donald Trump told his father that the company\\'s work was inferior, Friel said, even though the general contractor had approved it. The bottom line, Trump told Edward Friel, was the company wouldn\\'t get the final payment. Then, Friel said Trump added something that struck the family as bizarre. Trump told his dad that he could work on other Trump projects in the future. \\'Wait a minute,\\' Paul Friel said, recalling his family\\'s reaction to his dad\\'s account of the meeting. \\'Why would the Trump family want a company who they say their work is inferior to work for them in the future?\\' Asked about the meeting this week, Trump said, \\'Was the work bad? Was it bad work?\\' And, then, after being told that the general contractor had approved it, Trump added, \\'Well, see here\\'s the thing. You\\'re talking about, what, 30 years ago?\\' Ivanka Trump added that any number of disputes over late or deficient payments that were found over the past few decades pale in comparison to the thousands of checks Trump companies cut each month. \\'We have hundreds of millions of dollars of construction projects underway. And we have, for the most part, exceptional contractors on them who get paid, and get paid quickly,\\' she said, adding that she doubted any contractor complaining in court or in the press would admit they delivered substandard work. \\'But it would be irresponsible if my father paid contractors who did lousy work. And he doesn\\'t do that.\\' But, the Friels\\' story is similar to experiences of hundreds of other contractors over the casino boom in Atlantic City. Legal records, New Jersey Casino Control Commission records and contemporaneous local newspaper stories recounted many tales about the Trumps paying late or renegotiating deals for dimes on the dollar. In 1990, casino commission records revealed that Trump\\'s companies owed a total of $69.5 million to 253 subcontractors on the Taj Mahal project. Some had sued, the state said; others were negotiating with Trump to recover what they could. The companies\\' hundreds of workers had installed walls, chandeliers, plumbing, lighting and even the casino\\'s trademark minarets. One was Marty Rosenberg, vice president of Atlantic Plate Glass Co., who said he was owed about $1.5 million for work at the Taj Mahal. Rosenberg took on an informal role representing about 100 to 150 contractors in negotiations with Trump. \\'Yes, there were a lot of other companies,\\' he said. \\'Yes, some did not survive.\\' Rosenberg said his company was among the lucky ones. He had to delay paying his own suppliers. But the negotiations led to him eventually getting about 70 cents on the dollar for his work, and he was able to pay all of his suppliers in full. Even Trump\\'s own attorneys, on several occasions, sued him over claims of unpaid bills. One law firm that fought contractors over payments and other issues for Trump — New York City\\'s Morrison Cohen LLP — ended up on the other side of a similar battle with the mogul in 2008. Trump didn\\'t like that its lawyers were using his name in news releases touting its representation of Trump in a lawsuit against a construction contractor that Trump claimed overcharged him for work on a luxury golf club. As Trump now turned his ire on his former lawyers, however, Morrison Cohen countersued. In court records, the law firm alleged Trump didn\\'t pay nearly a half-million dollars in legal fees. Trump and his ex-lawyers settled their disputes out of court, confidentially, in 2009. Trump claims in his presidential personal financial disclosure to be worth $10 billion as a result of his business acumen. Many of the small contractors and individuals who weren\\'t paid by him haven\\'t been as fortunate. Edward Friel, of the Philadelphia cabinetry company allegedly shortchanged for the casino work, hired a lawyer to sue for the money, said his son, Paul Friel. But the attorney advised him that the Trumps would drag the case out in court and legal fees would exceed what they\\'d recover. The unpaid bill took a huge chunk out of the bottom line of the company. \\'The worst part wasn\\'t dealing with the Trumps,\\' said Paul Friel, who now lives on Merritt Island in Florida. After standing up to Trump, Friel said the family struggled to get other casino work in Atlantic City. \\'There\\'s tons of these stories out there,\\' he said. The Edward J. Friel Co. filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 5, 1989. Says the founder\\'s grandson: \\'Trump hits everybody.\\'  Contributing: John Kelly, Nick Penzenstadler, Karen Yi, David McKay Wilson       Photo via (cc) Flicker user (cc) New Hampshire Public Radio  Donald Trump once bragged at a campaign rally that “I have the best words.” Well, according to researchers from Carnegie Mellon, he speaks those “best words” at a middle-school level. Researchers Elliot Schumacher and Maxine Eskenazi analyzed the speeches of the current Republican and Democratic presidential candidates to measure the grade level of their vocabulary and grammar, and Trump scored the lowest.  Trump’s speeches are notoriously off the cuff, low on specifics, and big on platitudes—and research says they’re spoken at a seventh-grade reading level. Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton deliver speeches at an eight-grade reading level, and Marco Rubio, now out of the race, speaks just below a tenth-grade level. Bernie Sanders is the most linguistically advanced of the pack, with the language of his speeches registering at an eleventh-grade level. According to analysis reported on in October by  The Boston Globe, Trump speaks at a fourth-grade level, but this research used a different measuring stick, the Flesch-Kincaid readability test, which bases its rankings on sentence length and number of syllables per word. Trump’s simple speaking style may account for his popularity among certain voters. A recent study by  The New York Times  found that “in the places where support for him runs the strongest, the proportion of the white population that didn’t finish high school is relatively high.”  The Atlantic  backs up that figure, saying, “The single best predictor of Trump support in the GOP primary is the absence of a college degree.”  (H/T Carnegie Mellon)  \\n A lot has been written about\\xa0Donald Trump over the course of this campaign season, but a new revelation from a New York Times profile of Trump\\'s longtime butler may finally deliver the piece of information that brings him down — he enjoys his steaks well done. Very well done:\\n\\nFew people here can anticipate Mr. Trump’s demands and desires better than Mr. [Anthony] Senecal, 74, who has worked at the property for nearly 60 years, and for Mr. Trump for nearly 30 of them.\\nHe understands Mr. Trump’s sleeping patterns and how he likes his steak (\"It would rock on the plate, it was so well done\"), and how Mr. Trump insists — despite the hair salon on the premises — on doing his own hair.\\n\\nWell-done steak is great if you like dry, flavorless meat. As J. Kenji López Alt explained in an excellent food lab primer on steak science, a cut of meat \"cooked to 160°F (well-done) lost more than 10 times as much juice as the 120°F rare steak\" and also left \"a distinct layer of rendered fat floating on top of the juices.\" Cooking both the juice and the fat out of your steak completely negates the purpose of selecting a nice, expensive, well-marbled piece of meat in the first place. Trump\\'s poor taste in this regard possibly explains the massive failure of his Trump Steaks business.\\nIt\\'s also a reminder that Trump has a dangerous habit of neglecting expertise.\\n Any chef will tell you that this is not how you should be ordering steak. But rather than using his considerable wealth and influence to surround himself with the best advice, Trump uses it to surround himself with yes men. In terms of running his own household, Trump himself is the main victim. But in the White House, this proclivity could be extremely dangerous.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n $95/year\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n $120/year\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n $250/year\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Other\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Yes, I\\'ll give $120/year\\n \\n \\n \\n Yes, I\\'ll give $120/year\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n We accept credit card, Apple Pay, and\\n \\n \\n Google Pay.

Tasha Dixon was 18 when she competed in the Miss USA pageant, winning the state crown. “Our first introduction to him was when we were at the dress rehearsal and half naked changing into our bikinis,” Ms Dixon told CBS.  “He just came strolling right in. There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything. Some girls were topless. Other girls were naked.” She added that people who worked for Mr Trump “pressured” the women to “fawn over him, go walk up to him, talk to him, get his attention” while still not fully dressed.  Ms Dixon added the situation made them feel awkward and physically vulnerable. Four women who competed in the 1997 Miss Teen USA beauty pageant also said the Republican used to walk in. Some of the girls were as young as 15. Former Miss Vermont Teen USA, Mariah Billado, told Buzzfeed: \"I remember putting on my dress really quick because I was like, \\'Oh my god, there\\'s a man in here.\" Three other girls chose to remain anonymous, but told the publication it was \"creepy\" and \"shocking\". Mr Trump said on the Howard Stern radio show in 2005 that he was “allowed”, as the owner of the pageant, to go backstage while the contestants were getting dressed.  Trump supporter says 50 shades of Grey is to blame for Trump sexual assault remarks  “You know they’re standing there with no clothes. Is everybody OK? And you see these incredible looking women. And so I sort of get away with things like that.” Ms Dixon told CBS she believed that Mr Trump owned the pageant for 19 years because he could “utilise his power around beautiful women” and there was no one above him to complain to. When Ms Dixon competed in 2001, the theme was empowering women. She said she had not listened to the radio show and her accusations were not politically motivated. The revelations come as a leaked video from 2005 show the presidential nominee bragging about sexually assaulting women. He released an apology within hours but defended the remarks as “locker room talk”. The remarks come in contrast to a statement from former Miss California, Carrie Prejean, who competed in the beauty pageant the same year as Ms Dixon. “To paint Mr Trump as someone who would purposely walk into a women’s dressing room and ask women to come impress him is the most disgusting accusation so far,” she said. Mr Trump used to own the Miss Universe, the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants until last year.   \\nThe New York Times: Digital and Home Delivery Subscriptions\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Offer for a New York Times News subscription; current subscribers not eligible.

And I figure it\\'s probably maybe the only way I\\'m going to get to heaven. So I better do a good job. Okay? Thank you.\" Trump also clarified to those gathered in Orlando his previous comments calling President Barack Obama and Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton the \"founders of ISIS.\" \"I made the statement before that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, these are the founders of ISIS. These are the founders of ISIS because of bad judgment,\" added Trump.  \"I said they get the most valuable player award. ISIS is going to present them with the most valuable player award, you know? Like in high school. Most valuable player.\" During his controversial run for president, Trump has made several awkward comments before conservative Christian audiences. Months back at a speech he delivered at Liberty University, Trump among other things, referred to Second Corinthians as \"Two Corinthians.\" \"He mispronounced a book of the Bible. He cursed — twice. And on Martin Luther King Day, the GOP presidential candidate said he was honoring the slain civil rights leader by dedicating to him the record crowds he says he drew for the school\\'s opening convocation,\" reported NPR in January.  \"Students in the room snickered and laughed, and advisers to two of Trump\\'s top rivals, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, were quick to point out the gaffe on Twitter.\" Trump\\'s remarks at the American Renewal Project gathering in Orlando come not long after he referred to Hillary Clinton as \"the devil.\" Speaking at a campaign rally in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania earlier this month, Trump argued that former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders should have refused to work with Clinton and Democratic Party leadership due to their treatment of him. \"[Bernie] made a bad deal. He should have not made a deal. He would have gone down as [having] done something really important,\" said Trump.  \"This guy has buyer\\'s remorse. He looked at that and he was so angry when they were talking about him and his people are angry at him and they should be.\" Trump then added that Sanders should have refused to help Clinton and that Sanders \"made a deal with the devil. She\\'s the devil.\" Trump has claimed that he is a Presbyterian Christian, but also says he has never asked God for forgiveness because he hasn\\'t done anything wrong that needs forgiving. In a July interview with The Christian Post, Florida Pastor Paula White said that Trump has put his faith in Jesus Christ and asked for the forgiveness of his sins.

He remarked recently that he is highly educated and that he has \"the best words.\"\\n The study(Opens in a new window), entitled \"A Readability Analysis of Campaign Speeches from the 2016 US Presidential Campaign,\" didn\\'t find Trump\\'s rivals faring much better. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders all scored between sixth- and\\xa0eighth grade\\xa0levels. Trump also scored lowest in vocabulary, coming in at the seventh-grade level. Trump\\'s grammar isn\\'t just bad for this year -- he\\'s also pretty close to being the worst of any president measured. Trump barely ekes it out over -- go ahead and take a guess -- George W. Bush. Abraham Lincoln scored the highest.  Trump scored low, but he also showed the greatest ability to change his grammar depending the audience. In other words, Trump is a grammar chameleon who can change to suit his listeners. \"Candidates give speeches to differing types of audiences over time, ranging from small gatherings with a specific issue in mind to larger general ones,\" the study noted.\\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\nElliot Schumacher and Maxine Eskenazi of Carnegie Mellon authored the study, which looked at the campaign speeches of the presidential candidates and previous presidents.  The study also looked at the likelihood that candidates would use the same words in many speeches.\\xa0 By this measure, Clinton easily leads. Cruz comes in dead last, highlighting his tendency to touch on the same topics with the same words in each speech. \"We can see that Hilary Clinton has the highest standard deviation and so the biggest change of choice of words from one speech to another, while Ted Cruz varies the least in his choices,\" the study noted.

In fact, the Republican front-runner is so confident, he says his supporters would stay loyal even if he happened to commit a capital offense. \"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn\\'t lose any voters, OK?\" Trump remarked at a campaign stop at Dordt College in Sioux Center, Iowa. \"It\\'s, like, incredible.\" The businessman, whose Trump Tower stands on the major Manhattan thoroughfare, cracked the joke Saturday to a receptive audience at the Christian college. Reached by CNN immediately after the event, Trump declined to clarify the statement. On Twitter, he remarked on the rally, saying, \"Just left Sioux Center, Iowa. My speech was very well received. Truly great people! Packed house — overflow!\" \\n  Just left Sioux Center, Iowa. My speech was very well received. Truly great people! Packed house- overflow!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 23, 2016 \\n \\n \\n NPR\\'s Don Gonyea reports that so far, the reaction to Trump\\'s remarks has followed a familiar pattern. \"His audiences love it. His opponents try to use it against him — but so far, to no avail,\" Gonyea reports. \"I talked to some of his supporters and they say, \\'Yeah, sometimes he makes me cringe, but I still like him and I still think he\\'s the right thing for America.\\' \" One supporter, who spoke to ABC News, said he found Trump\\'s point clear — but mentioned Trump could have articulated it differently. \\n \"He probably could\\'ve worded it a little bit better,\" campaign volunteer Brandon Fokkema said.

Click through some of Donald Trump\\'s most controversial Tweets:  But some evangelicals have been reticent to back Trump because of his inflammatory rhetoric. That\\'s never been a problem for other GOP nominees, at least in modern history. And he\\'s been trying to make the appeal, meeting with church leaders and making callouts during speeches. During his acceptance speech, Trump said, \"The support that they\\'ve given me, and I\\'m not so sure I totally deserve it, has been so amazing.\" But Trump\\'s campaign doesn\\'t often mention the issues that evangelicals really care about. Issues like abortion and marriage equality rarely, if ever, come up, especially since Trump has turned toward the general election. He still didn\\'t mention those issues, even when asking those voters to help him reach the pearly gates.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n By \\n ,\\n senior writer at Grub Street\\xa0\\n who covers the people who work and eat in New York City’s restaurants\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Overcooked.\\n Photo: Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n Time and again, noted threat to democracy Donald Trump proves that he is the rare individual who can plumb social depths you never even knew existed. In a revealing article with the New York Times, Anthony Senecal, the current historian and former longtime butler of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, goes deep on life with the Donald. Among the revelations: Trump is apparently afraid to show his legs off, wears differently colored hats to signal his moods, and likes to be serenaded with “Hail to the Chief” when he’s feeling blue. The most galling part, however, comes early, as Senecal describes in no uncertain terms just how Trump takes his steak: “It would rock on the plate, it was so well done.” Sad!\\n Steak cooked to the point of it being “well done” basically ruins everything great about steak, and the fact that Trump likes his to resemble petrified wood should be further proof for all Americans that he shouldn’t be trusted. It might also help to explain why the now-famous Trump Steaks were, according to the executive in charge of actually selling them, such a dismal failure, saying recently, “We literally sold almost no steaks.” Clearly, Trump is a man who does not know meat.\\n [NYT]\\n \\n \\n Tasteless Donald Trump Loves Well-Done Steak\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n  Donald Trump imagined what sex with Lindsay Lohan would be like in a 2004 interview on Howard Stern\\'s radio show.\\xa0 \\'She\\'s probably deeply troubled and therefore great in bed,\\' Trump told Stern when asked by the shock jock if he could imagine bedding the \\'troubled teen.\\'\\xa0 Trump went on to say: \\'How come the deeply troubled women, you know, deeply, deeply troubled, they\\'re always the best in bed?\\' Lohan was just 18-years-old at the time of the interview.

Yet he\\'s also inclusive in a way that virtually no other candidate is (with the exception of Bernie Sanders, whom I\\'ll get to in a second). Trump has his villains, for sure, but they\\'re never in the room he\\'s addressing. They are always outsiders, and usually far, far away in places like China or Russia or Mexico—unless they are people like Jeb Bush whom he dresses down to their faces, which is itself an act of solidarity with the audience. Watching Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio or George Pataki get slapped around by Trump is like watching Moe Greene get hassled by Michael Corleone. Even if you like Moe Greene, you want to see him get roughed up by a master. Trump \"loves\" the poorly educated without qualification, just as he loves the rich and the poor, the naked and the clothed, the fat and the skinny. In Vegas on February 23, he was channeling Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman and the universal oversoul of the American family. As long as you vote for him, it\\'s all good. He will look out for you and your interests. He\\'s  happy that he won the Hispanic vote, because it proves that we\\'re all on the same side—his side—and we\\'re all in it together. It\\'s easy to be cynical about this (and to be frankly terrified of a Trump presidency), but Trump is the least cynical politician in the 2016 race. He may be unprincipled, unphilosophical and all over the place, but nobody doubts that he believes everything he says, at least at the moment he\\'s saying it. And he\\'s willing to thank every goddamn person who votes for him, no matter how big or how little, because he\\'s in the service industry and that\\'s what you do in the service industry. When he says he loves the country, it\\'s not like when Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz says it. You know that, deep down, they absolutely  hate  lots of things in America and about America. They know that too many of us are greedy or lazy, too white or too brown, too fat or too skinny, too racist or anti-abortion or pro-abortion or soft on the gays or tough on guns or whatever. At the very least, as Hillary Clinton put it in an early debate, if you\\'re a Democrat, you hate the Republicans, right? And vice versa. They—the regular party types—are the haters. Trump doesn\\'t give off that vibe. Because if you\\'re talking with him, by definition you agree with him, and everything is going to be all right. We can work things out, make a good deal for everyone, trust me.  Even the poorly educated!  When was the last time that an American politician acknowledged the poorly educated as something other than a tumor on the body politic that needs to be eradicated, much less thanked them? Which brings me to the other establishment irritant in the 2016 election: Bernie Sanders. Because of the Clinton machine and the stacking of the Democratic deck against insurgents via superdelegates, it seems unlikely that Sanders will knock off the former secretary of state. Indeed, his policy agenda may not even make it into whatever slate of issues the Democrats pretend to care about for very long. Hillary is running as Barack Obama\\'s third term after all: She\\'ll stick with Obamacare (it used to be called Hillarycare!); she\\'s good with Dodd-Frank and droning Muslims and all that. She\\'s also not addressing the one thing that makes Sanders interesting to Democrats. \"The American people are saying, \\'No,\\' to a rigged economy,\" Sanders has said. As Glenn Beck has put it, Sanders \"is right. People are tired of this rigged system. We have a corrupt capitalist system right now.\" At the same time, Beck points out that Sanders\\'s solution, which is long on class warfare and short on anything other than free stuff for more people, regardless of wealth or work status, alienates most Americans. We don\\'t want free stuff so much as we want a legit shot at earning our way, argues Beck. And we want someone to put a stop to the \"rigged economy.\" Beck is a prominent anti-Trump voice, even contributing to the National Review\\'s  attack package on the billionaire and endorsing Ted Cruz as an alternative. I think he is generally accurate about Sanders\\'s appeal and its limits. Trust in government is already  at historical lows; putting the government in charge of more things, as Sanders wants to do, is no way to win hearts and minds. What Beck and other Trump critics miss is that Trump is essentially sending the same message as Sanders: The Donald feels your pain. More than that, he feels your anger, your resentment, your sense of losing through no fault of your own. The Donald also feels this too. More than that, he loves you. He\\'s  proud of you. And he\\'s going to make things right for you, through a mix of great dealmaking and ball-busting and force and whatever it takes. Because you, my poorly educated friends and my highly educated friends, the young and the old—you\\'re all part of America, and nobody loves America more than Trump. He wants to make it great again after all, whereas all these other candidates do is bitch and moan about how awful this type of person is or that type of person is. It was an unintentional laugh line when Hillary Clinton, earlier this year, said she wanted to talk about  \"love and kindness.\" Her entire career is a testament to low-grade paranoia and the \"politics of personal destruction.\" The most common sense of her,  according to Gallup, is \"Dishonest/Liar/Don\\'t trust her/Poor character.\" People may not like Trump either—he\\'s the only candidate with even higher negatives than Clinton—but they\\'re more likely to believe that he will do what he says he\\'s going to do. And they are more likely to believe him when he talks of love and kindness too. Because he actually says it from time to time too.

JUPITER, Fla. (AP) — After winning the day’s two biggest prizes in the Republican race for president, Donald Trump was in the mood to celebrate. No, not his wins in Michigan and Mississippi. The front-runner for the GOP nomination wanted to celebrate his skill selling things to eat and drink, among other things, defending business ventures that have increasingly come under attack in ads and in debates. Before Trump’s arrival at a news conference at his golf course in Jupiter, Florida, club staff set up displays of Trump-branded products on either side of his podium. There were bottles of Trump red, white and rose wine, cases of Trump water and two butcher blocks heaping with stacks of giant, well-marbled “Trump Steaks.” And it wasn’t long after Trump started that he moved past Tuesday night’s election results and began to focus on the foodstuffs on display. “I brought some things up because, he said, ‘Water company is gone.’ I said, ‘It is?’ I didn’t know that,” Trump said. Trump was referring to a scathing speech delivered last week by 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who sought to undermine Trump’s success in this year’s campaign by outlining what he called the billionaire’s business failures. “Whatever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there’s Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks, and Trump Mortgage?” said Romney. “A business genius he is not.” Romney didn’t make reference to Trump’s defunct bottled water company, Trump Ice, in his remarks. But Trump nonetheless gestured to cases of Trump-branded “Natural Spring Water,” bottles of which are available at his hotels and golf clubs. “He talked about the water company. Well, there’s the water company. I mean, we sell water. And we have water, and it’s a very successful, you know, it’s a private little water company, and I supply the water for all my places, and it’s good. But it’s very good,” Trump said. Trump also touted a long list of his other assets, including the Trump International Golf Club in Jupiter, where friends and club members had gathered for the event. He stressed that he owns it and several other clubs outright, and they’re all debt-free. Trump then moved onto the steaks. “Trump steaks, where are the steaks? Do we have the steaks?” he said. “We have Trump steaks. And by the way, you want to take one, we charge you about, what, 50 bucks a steak?” But you can’t buy “Trump Steaks,” not anymore. The ones Romney mentioned in his speech were sold exclusively by The Sharper Image stores in 2007, in a venture that quickly fizzled. A page on the company’s website now reads, “Unfortunately, Trump Steaks are no longer available, but their legacy endures. And, whether you think Donald Trump’s candidacy is real steak or just sizzle, we hope you’ll enjoy this blast from the past.” A spokeswoman for Trump’s campaign did not respond immediately to a request for comment, but the labels on the steaks displayed Tuesday night appeared to match those of a company called Bush Brothers. A club staff member said that’s the butcher that supplies the club. Trump also showed off a copy of Trump Magazine, which is distributed at clubs and isn’t the same as the glossy magazine that folded in 2009. He also repeatedly defended his Trump University business seminars, which are the subject of several lawsuits. “So I wanted to put that to rest: So you have the water, you have the steaks, you have the airline that I sold. I mean, what’s wrong with selling?” he said. “Every once in a while you can sell something. You have the wines and all of that. And Trump University, we’re going to start it up as soon as I win the lawsuit.” ___ Follow Jill Colvin on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/colvinj  \\n \\n\\t   \\n WASHINGTON, D.C. – \\nTechnology has advanced well beyond what most of us would have ever dreamed up. Between the supercomputers in our pockets to Google’s self-driving cars, we live in an age of wonder. Japan has been at the forefront of another technology for many years in the form of sex robots, or uber-realistic robots that can be used for sexual pleasure and, frankly, not much else.\\nIt has recently been discovered that Donald Trump’s wife, Melania Trump, to whom the Donald has been married for the last 10 years, is actually a lab-created robot who was built for the Republican candidate on special order.\\n“She is beautiful, charming, and she’s an amazing lay,” said The Donald to a group of supporters, recently. “No woman in her right mind would be with me with those atributes. Not even with my wealth and power. I know that – I’m not as dumb as the media makes me out to be. No, instead, I had the best engineers in Japan build Melania for me in a lab. She is 100% to my specifications.”\\nTrump says that the best part about having a sex robot for a wife is that they “always give it up” when you want it, and it’s not even rape, because they’re not people.\\n“They also can’t get pregnant, which is fantastic, because no one likes pulling out, that’s for sure,” said Donald. “This model will be good on these batteries until long after I’m dead. It’s truly a marvel of modern technology.”\\nIf Trump wins the presidency, then Melania will be the first sex robot to become the first lady, as well as the first straight sex-machine\\xa0to sleep in the Lincoln bedroom since Marilyn Monroe had her affair with JFK.\\nComments  comments \\n\\t   As Donald Trump searched for a historic comparison for his\\xa0massive crowds and unexpected popularity, he settled on a revered Republican superhero: Ronald Reagan. “Now, Reagan had a little bit of this, but I don\\'t think to the same extent,\"\\xa0Trump said in an interview with Mark Halperin and John Heilemann\\xa0of Bloomberg\\'s \"With All Due Respect\"\\xa0on Wednesday night, having just finished a boisterous\\xa0rally before a crowd of more than 11,000 in Pensacola, Fla. \"But he also won.\\xa0So I haven\\'t been in that position yet... We have to see what happens.\\xa0I think that the closest thing that I can think of is Reagan, but I don\\'t think it\\'s the intensity that we have.\"  Trump said in the interview that the political movement he has sparked is historic, something that\\'s \"greater than anything we\\'ve seen in this country.\" But\\xa0he\\xa0added\\xa0that this unexpected popularity only matters if he wins the nomination and presidency.    Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump expressed frustration with the audio quality of his microphone and vowed not to pay the person who installed it. (Video: Reuters, Photo: Charles Ommanney/Reuters)    Republican presidential candidates frequently mention Reagan on the campaign trail —\\xa0but usually in a more reverent way.\\xa0Trump is not one to lowball his popularity. He obsesses over poll numbers and has been known to slightly or dramatically inflate his crowd counts, even though\\xa0he regularly\\xa0sees audience sizes that none of\\xa0his Republican rivals can match. Trump has said he expects historic numbers of voters to\\xa0turn out because of him, just as the televised Republican debates have experienced\\xa0historic viewership. And he plans to\\xa0do well not only with working-class whites, who seem to be his base of support, but also with African Americans and Latinos, despite some of his controversial comments that have enraged activists. \"If you think about it, if you take a look at what I\\'ve done, I\\'ve brought millions and millions of people to the Republican Party, and to the conservative party, because, as an example, the debate had 24 million people. If I wasn\\'t in the debate, would it have had three, or four, or two, or what would it have been?\" Trump said in an interview with the Washington Examiner that was published earlier this week. \"And you look at the kind of numbers that they\\'re doing on television, where every one of the stations, the networks that are covering us, and honestly in particular covering me, because I do seem to get a lot more coverage than anybody else, but their ratings are through the roof. So that focus is a very important focus because other people are allowed to take advantage of all of the eyeballs that I\\'m bringing to the screen.\"   Donald Trump says his supporters love him to death. In perhaps his most outrageous comments yet, the GOP front-runner insisted Saturday that his fans are so loyal they\\'d stick by him even if he carried out a massacre in the heart of Manhattan. \"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot people and I wouldn\\'t lose voters, okay,\" Trump said at a campaign event in Sioux City, Iowa. \"It\\'s, like, incredible.\" Trump made the unsettling boast as he slammed surging rival Ted Cruz\\'s support as \"soft,\" according to Texas Tribune reporter Patrick Svitek.    Trump’s supporters, who took a moment for prayer at his Iowa rally (pictured), are apparently more loyal than any other politician’s, ever. (Evan Vucci/AP)      HATERS IN CHIEF: FIND YOUR CANDIDATE BY WHAT THEY HATE   The billionaire mogul and Texas senator have stepped up attacks in recent days. The pair, who began the campaign singing each other\\'s praises, released dueling attack ads Friday. At his Saturday event, Trump said Cruz is \"going down big, big, big\" in the polls, according to Svitek.    While his supporters may be loyal, there are still many people who are just as dedicated to rejecting his hate-filled rhetoric. (Evan Vucci/AP)    The Donald also needled Cruz for drawing the support of ultra-conservative commentator Glenn Beck, who is planning to stump for the Texan in Iowa. \"I would much rather have Sarah Palin than Glenn Beck,\" Trump said, according to Svitek. \"Look, Glenn\\'s a loser.\"  rschapiro@nydailynews.com   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 21 July 2016, 16:33 | Updated: 21 July 2016, 16:34 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Presidential candidate said his teacher \\'didn\\'t know anything about music\\'.\\n \\n \\n \\n The Republican Party nominee in this year\\'s US Presidential elections is known for expressing himself forcefully.

To understand why, consider the billionaire’s ego not just as mere mortals might see it (an outsized allotment of conceit) but also as Trump himself understands it (an extraordinary drive for excitement, glamour and style that produces extraordinary success.)\\t\\nAs Trump once put it: “People need ego; whole nations need ego.”\\nThe race for the White House, then, may be Trump’s ultimate ego trip, guided by the same instincts he’s relied on in a lifetime of audacious self-promotion, ambition and risk-taking.\\nIt was those instincts that allowed a fabulously wealthy businessman to pull off a mind meld with the economic anxieties of ordinary Americans, elbowing aside the Republican A-team and breaking every rule of modern politics to become the party’s presumptive presidential nominee.\\n“I play to people’s fantasies,” Trump has acknowledged. And plenty of voters fantasize about bringing some of that Trump braggadocio to the American psyche.\\nTrump’s candidacy has given rise to a whole nation of armchair analysts with their own theories to explain the man: He’s a bully. He’s a champion. He’s insecure. He’s a rebel. He’s a narcissist. He’s an optimist. He’s calculating. He’s unscripted. He lacks self-awareness. He’s brimming with insight. He’s a pathological liar. He sees a larger truth.\\t\\nTrump himself shies away from self-analysis. But he’s acknowledged that for much of his life, it’s been all about the chase: Whatever it is, he’s in it to win it.\\n“The same assets that excite me in the chase often, once they are acquired, leave me bored,” he told an interviewer in 1990, as his boom years were sliding toward bust. “For me, you see, the important thing is the getting, not the having.”\\nThat mindset has generated plenty of speculation about whether Trump really wants to set aside his my-way lifestyle to shoulder the heavy demands of governing.\\nTrump bats away such talk. But his campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has sketched out a limited level of presidential engagement for Trump in discussing a strong role for the candidate’s vice presidential choice.\\n“He needs an experienced person to do the part of the job he doesn’t want to do,” Manafort told The Huffington Post in May. He said Trump sees himself as chairman of the board, not the CEO and certainly not chief operating officer.\\nAs a presidential candidate, Trump has a straightforward pitch.\\n“The country has been great to me and I want to give back,” he says. “And if people want me to do that, I think I’ll do a fantastic job for them.”\\nNot just fantastic. Perhaps even celestial.\\n“I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created,” Trump said in his announcement speech.\\nTrump’s unbounded confidence — and obsession with winning — has been a lifelong constant, evident in ways small and large.\\nGrowing up as one of five children in a well-to-do Queens real estate family, Donald was the brash one, a fighter from the start.\\n“We gotta calm him down,” his father would say, as Trump recalls it. “Son, take the lumps out.”\\nFor good or ill, it’s advice Trump never really embraced.\\nMilitary school helped channel his energy, but Trump’s rebellious streak remained.\\nTrump followed his father into real estate, but chafed within the confines of Fred Trump’s realm in New York’s outer boroughs.\\nManhattan’s skyline beckoned; Trump crossed the East River and never looked back.\\n“He’s gone way beyond me, absolutely,” an admiring Fred marveled. His son had made it big in Manhattan well before he hit 40.\\nSo successful at such a young age, Trump never did have to smooth out those lumps that his father had warned about.\\n“He was at the top of his own pyramid,” says Stanley Renshon, a political psychologist at the City University of New York who is writing a book about Trump. “Nobody was going to say, ‘Donald, tone it down.’”\\nTrump, who stresses his Ivy League education, revels in juvenile jabs, labeling his adversaries “stupid,” “dumb” and “bad.”\\n“I know words,” he declared at a December campaign rally where he criticized the Obama administration. “I have the best words. But there’s no better word than stupid, right?”\\nWith no one to shush or second-guess him, brashness has been Trump’s way, along with his trademark glitz and flash. (Flash, in Trump’s lexicon, registers a level below glitz.)\\nThrough years of boom, bust and more than a decade of reality-TV celebrity on “The Apprentice,” the deals kept coming and the price tags (and, often, the debt) kept growing — as did the hype.

Trump also brought up his disdain for the tent that the White House sometimes erects on the South Lawn for state dinners with world leaders. In his presidential campaign, Trump often tells of offering to build — and pay for — a “great, grand ballroom.”\\nAxelrod largely confirms Trump’s account — with one big exception.\\n“I honestly don’t recall him ever saying that he would pay for it,” says Axelrod. “That’s a line I would have remembered.”\\nHe’s not all chutzpah.\\nIvanka Trump tells of her “incredibly empathetic” father reaching out to help strangers he sees mentioned in the news whose stories of adversity touch him.\\n— A Mississippi man remembers Trump picking up the phone when his father wrote to ask for a loan to build a hotel back in 1988.

He appealed to the everyman tired of pate from political elites and hungry for red meat. (Even if some of his supporters don’t want to admit it.)\\nTrump’s challenge now is to balance his raging-bull persona with the policy details and presence that voters associate with a president.\\nIn the primaries, says Renshon, Trump “was the guy who had his finger on what people wanted.”\\nRenshon adds: “The traits that got him to where he has gotten are not necessarily the only traits he’s going to need to get across the finish line.”\\n AP News Researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this report. \\n\\t       Donald Trump reportedly told two 14-year-old girls in 1992 that he would be dating one of them “in a couple of years.”  A news brief published in the Chicago Tribune at the time said the girls were part of a youth choir singing outside the Plaza Hotel in New York City when Trump approached them and asked their ages.  “Wow,” Trump replied after being told they were 14, according to the account, which resurfaced this week. “Just think ― in a couple of years I’ll be dating you.” The crack was similar to one the GOP presidential nominee made about a 10-year-old in a recently resurfaced tape, also from 1992. In that clip, recorded for an “Entertainment Tonight” Christmas special, the then-46-year-old Trump greeted the girl on an escalator at Trump Tower. Turning to the camera, he said: “I am going to be dating her in 10 years. Can you believe it?”  The reports resurfaced after Trump was caught on audio saying he engaged in sexual assault, kissing women and grabbing their genitals without their consent. While Trump has repeatedly dismissed the comments as “locker-room talk,” several women have since come forward to accuse the real estate mogul of groping.    Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly   incites political violence   and is a   serial liar  ,   rampant xenophobe  ,   racist  ,   misogynist   and   birther   who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.        Before You Go       16 Things Donald Trump Has Said About Women, Round 2     Popular in the Community   You May Like\\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Donald Trump appears on \"The Dr. Oz Show.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Dr. Oz Show\\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump appeared on \"The \"Dr. Oz Show\" on Thursday to discuss his medical records, and he said he still feels like a man in his 30s.\\n \\n Trump insisted on the show that he\\'s in good health and said he has the stamina of a much younger person.

According to The Miami Herald, The Paint Spot claimed Trump has owed them the money since 2014. \\n \\n \\n Court records show the judge in the case canceled the scheduled foreclosure sale on Tuesday after a hearing, but the broader legal fight over the bill continues. \\n \\n \\n The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry into whether the bill was paid or a response to the investigations broadly. \\n \\n \\n In another case, the Philadelphia cabinet business of Edward Friel Jr. was never paid more than $83,000 for work completed in 1984, the weight of which Friel’s son said started the fall of the company.\\n \\n \\n USA Today analyzed at least 60 lawsuits and more than 200 mechanic’s liens for the report, also finding 24 citations since 2005 of Trump’s companies for violating the Fair Labor Standards Act “for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage.”\\n \\n \\n The court records showed not only a pattern of not paying, but also of Trump companies tying up small businesses and individuals in lengthy legal dealings until they either settle, give up or sometimes go out of business altogether. \\n \\n \\n In response to the report, Trump told USA Today in an interview that he only stiffs or shorts bills if the work is unsatisfactory.\\n \\n \\n “Let’s say that they do a job that’s not good, or a job that they didn’t finish, or a job that was way late. I’ll deduct from their contract, absolutely,” Trump said. “That’s what the country should be doing.”\\n \\n \\n And his spokeswoman provided The Wall Street Journal with a list of companies that reported good business dealings with Trump’s organization and in a few cases, bonuses for good work.\\n \\n \\n “I pay thousands of bills on time,” Trump told the Journal. \\n \\n \\n Trump weighed in on USA Today’s report again on Saturday, tweeting, “@USATODAY did article saying I don’t pay bills- false, only don’t pay when work is shoddy, bad, or not done! They should do same!”\\n \\n    As two more women came forward Friday with allegations of sexual assault by Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee used a campaign appearance in North Carolina to discredit his growing list of accusers as part of a vast media conspiracy against him, and insulted two of them as too unattractive for him to have groped. “Believe me, she would not be my first choice,” Trump said of Jessica Leeds, 74, who alleged in a bombshell New York Times story Wednesday that the real-estate billionaire had grabbed her breasts and stuck his hand up her skirt while seated next to her on a flight in the 1980s. He also mocked Natasha Stoynoff, a writer for People who alleged in a first-person account, also published Wednesday night, that Trump had forced himself on her during an interview in 2005. “Check out her Facebook page, you’ll understand,” he jeered, standing before a crowd of thousands of supporters at the White Oak Amphitheater in Greensboro. Trump also appeared to insult the appearance of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, telling the audience that when she walked in front of him during the last presidential debate, “believe me, I wasn’t impressed.” Continuing to rant, Trump claimed that journalists at The New York Times, which published allegations made by Leeds and another woman, Rachel Crooks, were “corporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim and Hillary Clinton,” referring to the paper’s largest individual share holder and Trump’s Democratic rival for the presidency. In recent days, Trump has targeted Slim, a Mexican billionaire, as part of a shadowy alliance of global elites trying to sabotage his candidacy. “We’ve seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special-interest friends, and her donors,” Trump said at a rally Thursday. While Trump has sought to portray his accusers as liars seeking fame, the list of his accusers continues to grow. Even as Trump was campaigning in North Carolina, two more women came forward with allegations of sexual assault at the hands of the G.O.P. nominee: one a former model who claims that the billionaire unexpectedly reached up her skirt while she was at a nightclub, and the other a former Apprentice candidate who said she had been assaulted while seeking a job with the Trump Organization.   The Washington Post  published a story about Kristin Anderson, who says she was an aspiring model in her 20s when Trump grabbed her without consent. According to Anderson’s account, she was at a club with her friends when she felt somebody grabbing her. She instinctively shoved the person away, and turned to face her assailant: it was Trump. “He was so distinctive looking—with the hair and the eyebrows. I mean, nobody else has those eyebrows,” Anderson, now 46, told the Post.   In a press conference held with celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred later Friday, Summer Zervos, a candidate from Season 5 of The Apprentice, gave another account of being assaulted by Trump in 2007. When she met with Trump in New York for the reality-TV show, he kissed her on the mouth twice, she said, rationalizing at the time that perhaps this was the way that Trump greeted people. That opinion changed, she said, when Trump invited her for dinner at the Beverly Hills Hotel shortly afterward, ostensibly to talk about a job. Instead, she alleged, Trump repeatedly attempted to kiss and grope her, at one point thrusting his genitals. Zervos had sent Trump an e-mail in April, as he closed in on the Republican presidential nomination, saying that she had been “incredibly hurt” by their interaction, but had not planned to come forward publicly until after video surfaced last week of Trump bragging about using his celebrity to grope women without their consent. “I felt like I had to speak out on your behavior. You do not have the right to treat women as sexual objects because you are a star,” she said. During the second presidential debate on Sunday, Trump denied ever having done any of the things he boasted about on tape, describing his comments as merely “locker-room talk” and that “no one has more respect for women” than he does. Days afterward, several news outlets published stories from different women, largely private citizens, who alleged that Trump had forced himself on them without their consent. Anderson and Zervos’s testimony brings the number up to at least 11. Anderson, who is neither a Trump nor Hillary Clinton supporter, had only told her story to a handful of associates over the years, and had not planned to come forward until a Post reporter, who had heard about the incident from a friend, had contacted her. Trump has repeatedly denied the accounts of his accusers. Spokeswoman Hope Hicks told the Post Friday that Anderson only wanted “free publicity.” The Trump campaign has also attempted to turn the scrutiny back on Bill Clinton, whose own history of alleged assault has been well known for years.

Mark Sanford said Friday that Donald Trump has a “callous disregard for details” that was on full display when the GOP presidential candidate told a private meeting of House Republicans he would fiercely defend articles of U.S. Constitution that don’t exist. \\n \\n \\n “I think what a number of us have been concerned about is a pattern of laxity with regard to details,” Sanford told CNN in an interview, explaining that details are critical to good governance, one day after he was part of a group meeting with the presumptive Republican presidential candidate. “It is the details that really matter in impacting people’s lives. It is the details that matter frankly in any legislative negotiation.”\\n \\n \\n The South Carolinian lawmaker, who has been critic of Trump, said that lack of respect for details could make it difficult for the businessman to be a successful president. \\n \\n \\n “I wasn’t particularly impressed,” Sanford told reporters after Thursday’s meeting at an event. “I think it was the normal stream of consciousness that’s long on hyperbole and short on facts. At one point there was mentioned – somebody asked about, you know, Article I powers and what would you do to protect them and you know, I think his response was ‘I want to protect Article I, Article II, Article XII – go down the list.’ As we both know there is no Article XII.”\\n \\n \\n Trump’s answer came in response to a question from a House Republican about whether Trump as president would defend the prerogatives of Congress that are laid out in Article I of the Constitution. The issue is highly important to lawmakers who are frustrated by the powers of the presidency, which are defined in Article II of the Constitution but that have expanded in recent years by the increased use of executive authority.\\n \\n \\n There are a total of just seven articles to the Constitution although there are many more amendments to the founding document, which could be what Trump was referring to accidentally.\\n \\n \\n The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to CNN for a comment about the apparent gaffe in the meeting or Sanford’s concerns.\\n \\n \\n RELATED: Trump clashes with GOP critic\\n \\n \\n When Trump made his comments “a number of people looked around at each other at that point with a little bit of a quizzical or curious eye,” Sanford told CNN Friday. \\n \\n \\n Sanford, who still hasn’t decided if he will back his party’s presumptive nominee, acknowledged Trump has successfully connected with voters even as he glosses over the minutia of governing. \\n \\n \\n “I would say we all love broad sweeping statements. They’re pleasant. At times they’re amusing, at times they’re interesting, but in terms of making a difference in people’s lives, it’s the details that matter,” Sanford said. \\n \\n \\n Sanford also defended Trump. \\n \\n \\n RELATED: Newt Gingrich defends Trump’s Star of David tweet\\n \\n \\n While “there seems to be a deliberate lack of detail” from the candidate, there is not “malfeasance” – as Sanford said was on display Thursday in a House committee that was examining Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s email usage while running the State Department. \\n \\n \\n “What we’re left with is a Faustian choice between malfeasance and very callous disregard for details,” Sanford said.\\n \\n \\n In the meeting with House Republicans, Trump repeatedly stressed the importance of a Republican winning the White House because of the balance of power on the Supreme Court. In the end, Sanford suggested that issue might be enough to tilt him to vote for Trump, something initially he didn’t think he would do. \\n \\n    THE VILLAGES, Fla. — A defiant Donald Trump touched off a political maelstrom Sunday that didn’t spare his Republican and Democratic presidential rivals, as he threatened to encourage supporters to stage protests against Sen. Bernie Sanders and drew escalating criticism from GOP opponents desperate to slow him ahead of Tuesday’s crucial nominating contests. The mogul’s impact on both political parties illustrated the unusual position he occupies in the race. His unpredictable and combative approach will face its biggest test yet this week in five primaries that offer him an opportunity to effectively put away his Republican competition. A new round of public polling showed Trump leading comfortably in Florida, Tuesday’s biggest prize.  In Ohio, another delegate-rich state that is seen by many Trump critics as perhaps the last best chance to force the front-runner into a lengthy battle for the nomination, surveys showed he was in a close fight with the state’s governor, John Kasich. Trump scrapped plans for a \\xadMonday-evening rally in Florida and replaced it with one in Ohio. The other primaries Tuesday are in Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina.  There will also be Republican caucuses in the Northern Marianas. Here in Florida, Sen. Marco Rubio made a last-minute push to avoid a humiliating loss in his home state that supporters fear would end his campaign. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas campaigned in North Carolina and Ohio, attempting to position himself to add to his delegate total, which is second only to Trump’s. Kasich, who has yet to win a state, made an urgent push on his home turf. On the Democratic side, front-runner Hillary Clinton tried to put more distance between herself and Sanders, who won an upset victory in Michigan last week. Throughout it all, the presence of Trump — who has come under heavy criticism from opponents who have bluntly accused him of fueling divisive discourse and violent clashes at his events — could be felt.  [Can Donald Trump keep blaming others for the anger of his campaign?]  The billionaire businessman did not bow to calls to soften his aggressive tone. Instead, he lashed out at his Republican competition and blamed San\\xadders’s supporters for forcing him to cancel a rally set for Friday in Chicago, where violence spilled onto the streets. “Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disrupters aren’t told to go to my events,” Trump said on Twitter.     Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign event at the Savannah Center in West Chester, Ohio on Sunday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  “Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours!” In a campaign stop in Bloomington, Ill., Trump said there would be a double standard if his backers disrupted rallies for the senator from Vermont. “They’ll lock you up for the rest of your life and give you the electric chair and say, ‘Oh, poor Bernie, poor Bernie, he had to endure this!’\\u2009” Trump said. “With us, they don’t say that.” At his hour-long event, Trump also called Cruz a “liar” and said Kasich was weak on trade. Further inflaming tensions, Trump said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he has instructed his staff to look into paying legal fees for a 78-year-old white man who has been charged with sucker-punching a 26-year-old black protester at one of the real estate magnate’s recent rallies.  Trump said in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he didn’t consider his “Be careful Bernie” social-media post to be a threat.  He repeated his charge that Sanders had lied when he said his campaign wasn’t behind an influx of protesters that led to the cancellation of the planned Chicago rally.  [Sanders has gotten nastier. Does that help explain his staying power?]  Appearing on the same program, Sanders said Trump was not being truthful. “This man cannot stop lying,” Sanders said. He said that he has many supporters and that while some may attend Trump events as a form of peaceful protest, they are not doing so at his direction. “I would hope my supporters will not disrupt meetings,” Sanders said. “We have millions of supporters, and people do things. But it was not our campaign.” He blamed Trump for creating the environment that has led to violence at his rallies. “This is a man who keeps implying violence, and then you end up getting what you see,” Sanders said. Trump’s three GOP competitors issued sharp denunciations of their own. “Do we really want to live in a country where Americans hate each other? Where people are incapable of talking through an issue?” Rubio asked a crowd gathered at a sprawling retiree community here in The Villages. Without naming Trump, Rubio said the country is seeing \\xad“images we have not seen since the 1960s.” Campaigning in Strongsville, Ohio, Kasich said of Trump: “Well, look, I can’t control him. I’ve already said that what he’s done is create a toxic atmosphere. I just do what I can do.” Speaking at an event put on by his super PAC in Concord, N.C., Cruz continued to argue that he is the only candidate who can beat Trump, urging people who support other candidates to throw their votes behind him to ensure Trump doesn’t get the nomination. “Come join us, come on in, the water’s fine,” he said. Surveys from NBC News, the Wall Street Journal and Marist College, as well as polling from CBS News and YouGov, showed Trump leading Rubio by double digits in Florida and Cruz threatening Rubio for second place. Rubio has campaigned before small crowds in recent days.  In Ohio, new polling showed Trump and Kasich in tight competition at the head of the pack. Ohio will award 66 delegates to the victor there. Florida will give all 99 delegates to its winner. For the Democrats, the five contests that will be held Tuesday could be key to shaping the rest of the race.  Clinton leads in the delegate chase and is looking to pull away. Sanders is aiming to build on his come-from-behind victory in Michigan with strong showings in the Midwestern states of Missouri, Illinois and Ohio.  Clinton has held wide leads in polling in Florida, and Sanders is angling to keep it close in North Carolina. A day after the former secretary of state lambasted Trump’s rhetoric as “political arson,” she focused her message for much of Sunday on jobs and trade as she campaigned in Ohio. But Sunday evening at a Democratic dinner in Columbus, she unleashed her most critical assessment of the real estate mogul yet, accusing him of doing anything to get votes. “Donald Trump is running a cynical campaign of hate and fear, for one reason: to get votes,” she said. “He’s encouraging violence and chaos to get votes. He is pitting Americans against each other to get votes.” In addition to his back-and-forth with Trump, Sanders took aim at Clinton during his rally in the St. Louis area, outlining what he said are “strong” differences on trade, accepting donations from Wall Street, and the Iraq War.  Sanders’s advisers argue that after Tuesday, the map becomes more favorable to him, with several Western states they argue they can win, including Arizona, which votes March 22. But to remain viable in a race where Clinton already boasts a commanding lead in the delegate count, Sanders needs to post some strong showings Tuesday. In Bloomington, Trump’s speech was interrupted several times by protesters, some of whom tore up campaign signs. Each time, Trump ordered them to leave. “You see where they put themselves? Right in front of the cameras,” he said as one protester was escorted out. “That’s all they care about,” Trump said. “Disgusting.”  Mary Jane Nelson, a Rubio backer who came to see the senator from Florida at The Villages, summed up her view of Trump succinctly: “I find him very scary.” Wagner reported from St. Louis, Guarino from Bloomington, Ill.

I was like, ‘What’s that Mr. Trump?” recounted Bluff, 54. “He said, ‘This is where the [club] ballroom is going to be.’ He had the vision and the passion – and it was 6:30 in the morning.’”\\nBluff is among a number of Woodbridge Road dwellers, neighbors of Trump, who planned to vote for the Republican frontrunner in Tuesday’s pivotal Florida primary.\\n“He’s remarkable and I really hope he becomes our next president,” said Buff. “He has a way where it’s, ‘If I think I’m right, I’m going to do it,’” he added. “Much to everyone’s surprise he’s very true to his word – and he is a family man.”\\nSupport for Trump on the 13-home block isn’t surprising given that its residents have the club initiation fee – reportedly at least $150,000 – waived, in part to assuage concerns over increased traffic.\\nIt also helps that a number of current or recent residents are related to the presidential hopeful.\\nHis sisters, federal judge Maryann Trump Barry and Elizabeth Trump Grau, who works in banking, both own multi-million dollar homes there.\\nHis nephew, Dr. David Desmond, sold his home at the end of the street in November for $8.9 million.\\nAnd Trump owns a corner property that he leases or reserves for club members – including singer Elton John.\\n“I’ve had so many good experiences with the family,” said Merrill Lochmaier, 57, an investment banker who has rented a home on the block since 2004.\\n A house on Woodbridge Road in Palm Beach, Florida.Yoav Gonen \\nHe recalled how Trump recently went out of his way to give a personal tour of Mar-a-Lago to US Army veteran and Congressional Medal of Honor recipient Colonel Jack Jacobs.\\n“He had a busy day but he took it upon himself to give us a tour of the club and a tour of his private quarters – he really stopped what he was doing in order to entertain this gentleman,” said Lochmaier. “When he says he’s for the veterans, he really is.”\\nLochmaier said Trump’s business know-how is needed to deal with the country’s $19 trillion debt, and he dismissed critics of the presidential hopeful’s temperament.\\n ‘If the Titanic is going down and you’ve got one guy that can run the life boats, you want him running the show’\\xa0-\\xa0Neighbor Merrill Lochmaier on Trump\\n“If the Titanic is going down and you’ve got one guy that can run the life boats, you want him running the show – it doesn’t matter if he’s not politically correct,” said Lochmaier.\\nOne man who works for a homeowner on Woodbridge Road said he remembers seeing Trump going for walks down the block with his children when they were young.\\nHe said the homeowner doesn’t get along with Trump but wouldn’t want to talk about it.\\nKnocks on the doors of other homes – one owned by a German drugstore kingpin, another by a Canadian developer – yielded no response.\\nBut a Hispanic landscaper working outside Tuesday, a Republican who said he’s never met Trump, expressed concern over how Trump’s aggressive style would play with foreign leaders.\\n“It’s one thing to run a business and tell people what to do.

Fuji. The scene was gruesome. The houseâ\\x80\\x99s white paper screens were spattered with blood. The 54-year-old had been stabbed as many as 150 times. By some reports the weapon of choice was a samurai-style sword.\\nThe crime was never solved, though it bore the hallmarks of a killing by Japanâ\\x80\\x99s criminal yakuza. Ostensibly a real estate investor, Kashiwagi was a mysterious figure reputed to have underworld connections. He was also one of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s top five gamblers, a â\\x80\\x9cwhaleâ\\x80\\x9d in casino parlance, willing to wager $10 million in a single gaming bender. And that is how he crossed paths with Donald J. Trump, then a budding Atlantic City casino mogul. In 1990 the two men had an epic and remarkably personal showdown in which millions of dollars changed hands in a matter of days, before it all ended in a flurry of recriminations. One of the Japanese mogulâ\\x80\\x99s last statements to the U.S. media, through an aide, involved his plans to burn a copy of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s book, The Art of the Deal. \\nAfter his murder, the New York Times reported that he owed at least $9 million to casinos in Atlantic City and Las Vegas. One unnamed casino Atlantic City executive told the paper that Kashiwagi had owed the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino $4 million.\\nTrump is obsessed with winning, a topic he usually brings up in the context of his merciless deal-making style. But a crucial question about any would-be president who may be confronted with questions of war and peace is his attitude toward risk. Some presidentsâ\\x80\\x94Barack Obama comes to mindâ\\x80\\x94are highly averse to it. Others roll the dice, as George W. Bush did when he invaded Iraq. \\nThe story of Akio Kashiwagi, drawn from Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s memoirs and news accounts from the day, offers a revealing window into Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s instincts. It shows that Trump isnâ\\x80\\x99t just a one-time casino ownerâ\\x80\\x94heâ\\x80\\x99s also a gambler, prone to impulsive, even reckless action. In The Art of the Comeback, published in 1997, Trump explains that until he met Kashiwagi, he saw himself as an investor who dealt only in facts and reason. But his duel with the great whale in action made him realize â\\x80\\x9cthat I had become a gambler, something I never thought I was.â\\x80\\x9d\\nPerhaps just as important, when gambling failed him, Trump didn\\'t quit: He doubled down. But he did it shrewdly, summoning a former RAND Corporation mathematician to devise a plan that would maximize his chance of fleecing his Japanese guest.\\nAnd it worked. Kind of. In Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s recollection, which he shared for this story, his showdown with Kashiwagi was another one of his many great wins. Just donâ\\x80\\x99t look too hard at the ledger. \\n***\\nIn February of 1990, Donald Trump flew to Tokyo, where he was promoting a heavyweight bout between Mike Tyson and Buster Douglas. At a party for friends and business partners the night before the fight, Trump took Tyson around the room for photos. When Trump spotted one man standing alone in a corner, the mogul threw his arm around him and positioned him for a shot with Tyson.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo picture! No picture!â\\x80\\x9d the man shouted, covering his face.\\nThat man was Akio Kashiwagi. By then Trump had been courting the mysterious businessman for weeks, hoping that, with some luck, his seemingly limitless bank account could help keep Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s latest business venture afloat.\\nA few years earlier, Trump had begun an aggressive move into the Atlantic City casino business. He had three hotel-casinos under his belt, including the Trump Taj Mahal, modestly dubbed the â\\x80\\x9ceighth wonder of the world.â\\x80\\x9d\\nBut those enterprises required huge revenues to turn a profit. Retirees playing their Social Security checks would only get Trump so far. High rollers promised not only quick winnings, but that lifeblood of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s career: publicity.\\nKashiwagi fit the bill. His game was baccarat, a fast-paced card game similar to blackjack that is favored by James Bond. And he bet big, wagering up to $250,000 per hand. He was also a murky figure. The son of a carpenter, he claimed income of $100 million per year and assets of $1 billion, owned a palatial Tokyo home and retained a private chef who cooked him marinated monkey meat. But an independent assessment found his real estate business had revenues of only $15 million and a handful of staffers. Rumors swirled about his ties to the yakuzaâ\\x80\\x94perhaps explaining his aversion to photographers.\\nThe high-roller world is small, and the highest rollers are discussed among top casino owners. Trump first heard about Kashiwagi from the late Sir James Goldsmith, a European financier and casino owner. Kashiwagi had recently won nearly $20 million at Goldsmithâ\\x80\\x99s Diamond Beach casino in Australia, almost bankrupting it. But heâ\\x80\\x99d also blown $6 million on baccarat at Steve Wynnâ\\x80\\x99s Mirage casino in Las Vegas a year earlier. \\nTrumpâ\\x80\\x99s top casino executive warned him against inviting Kashiwagi to Atlantic City. Too risky, he said. Trump couldn\\'t resist. He told Kashiwagi there was a penthouse waiting for him at the Trump Plaza. Kashiwagi, in turn, was â\\x80\\x9ceager to match stakes with the famous Donald Trump,â\\x80\\x9d John Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell, then the casinoâ\\x80\\x99s chief operating officer, wrote in a memoir.\\nA few days after dodging the photo with Trump and Tyson, Kashiwagi arrived in Atlantic City. Trump greeted him with an autographed copy of The Art of the Deal. Things got off to an odd start, Trump would later recall in his own memoir: Kashiwagi retired to his bi-level penthouse suiteâ\\x80\\x94featuring ocean views, butler service, a grand piano and an $800,000 jade Buddhaâ\\x80\\x94and didnâ\\x80\\x99t emerge for two days. Finally he reappeared on a Friday night. Piles of $5,000 chips awaited him at a table reserved for his play. One $250,000 stack stood over a foot high, according to Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s later account.\\nWith his black hair slicked back, Kashiwagi played marathon sessions at a table roped off for his private use. Surrounded by bodyguards and watchful casino officials, he was supplied with hot towels and given a private bathroom; Trump even hired a Japanese chef to cook for him. Amid the opulence, Kashiwagi cut a modest profile. â\\x80\\x9cSipping tea amid tuxedo-clad baccarat croupiers, Mr. Kashiwagi, in his rumpled blue-striped shirt and plain black slippers, has the look of a quarter slot-machine player just off the bus from Hoboken,â\\x80\\x9d the Wall Street Journal reported at the time.\\nDozens of low-rollers peered over a marble wall into a world they could barely fathom. â\\x80\\x9cAll that money,â\\x80\\x9d one woman told the Philadelphia Inquirer. â\\x80\\x9cHow can anyoneâ\\x80¦ I can\\'t imagineâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\nIt was just the sort of publicity Trump had been seeking. â\\x80\\x9cThat [Kashiwagi] chose Trump Plaza was an enormous coup for us,â\\x80\\x9d Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell wrote. He was â\\x80\\x9cthe perfect complement to the world-class image we were marketing, and enhanced the Trump image of elegance and excitement.â\\x80\\x9d Kashiwagi â\\x80\\x9ccould propel Trump Plaza into an entirely new realm of action,â\\x80\\x9d Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell believed.\\nBut the great whale Trump had harpooned was threatening to swamp his boat.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrom the very first hand, Kashiwagi started beating the hell out of us,â\\x80\\x9d Trump wrote in Comeback. Trump was down a million dollars within half an hour.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat the hell am I doing? I asked myself,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote. \"Cash flow is way down, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m playing with a guy who could win $40 or $50 million in a matter of days.â\\x80\\x9d Suddenly, it became clear that this was a PR triumph that could put the Trump Plaza out of business.\\nEvery casino game has a built-in advantage for the house. But Trump grew alarmed as he focused on the fact that baccarat offers a relatively narrow dealer\\'s edge.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt that moment I realized for the first time that I had become a gambler,â\\x80\\x9d Trump wrote. Yes, he had speculated on real estate, based on sound judgment. â\\x80\\x9cBut this had nothing to do with logic or reason. I was merely sitting on the sidelines watching as one of the best gamblers in the world played against me for $250,000 per hand, seventy times an hour.â\\x80\\x9d \\nTrump was nervous to his core. In what he says was a first, he called down to the casino floor late that night to check on the ledger. He learned that he was down $4 millionâ\\x80\\x94a figure that would soon double. Kashiwagi had so many chips he had to pile them on the floor.\\nBut in public, Trump was typically unflappable. \"Have you ever seen action like this?\" he told the Inquirer, which had come to document the action at Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s behest. He was speaking at 4 a.m.; Trump had stayed up until his casino closed to monitor the first nightâ\\x80\\x99s action. \"This guy is great, the best in the world. The best.\"\\nThe ledger swung wildly through the weekend. Kashiwagi went on hot and cold streaks, enduring wild swings of millions of dollars. He played quietly, sometimes just smiling when he lost hands. But at times he flung his cards down in annoyance after losing, or made fists and opened them as if releasing frustrated energy.\\nHe soon decided heâ\\x80\\x99d had enough. He was becoming irritable, and the gawkers and multiplying news stories were spooking a man obsessed with privacy. He abruptly announced that he was headed back to Tokyo.\\nWith $6 million of Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s money in his pocket.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe quit, Jack. What the fuck?â\\x80\\x9d a furious Trump said to Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell. Trump had expected Kashiwagi to play for several days; heâ\\x80\\x99d stayed for only two.\\nWhere many people would retreat into shame and self-recrimination, Donald Trump doubled down. He immediately courted Kashiwagi to make a return visit, like a heavyweight boxing rematch. One Trump executive even publicly proposed a date for Kashiwagiâ\\x80\\x99s return: December 7, the anniversary of Japanâ\\x80\\x99s 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.\\nBehind the trademark bluster, however, Trump grew more calculated. Having looked in the mirror and seen a gambler, he reverted to careful strategy. Trump consulted Jess Marcum, a mathematical probabilities expert who had been an early employee of the RAND Corporationâ\\x80\\x94a government-affiliated think tank then better known for modeling nuclear war with the Soviet Unionâ\\x80\\x94on how to maximize his odds in a second showdown with Kashiwagi. Marcum knew the only way to compensate for the houseâ\\x80\\x99s very slight baccarat advantage, of just over one percent, was to keep the game going for as long as possible. Time was on Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s side. So Marcum and an Atlantic City casino insider named Al Glasgow prepared a report for Trump proposing a â\\x80\\x9cfreeze outâ\\x80\\x9d agreement. Under the deal, Kashiwagi would bring $12 million to the table and play until he had either doubled itâ\\x80\\x94or lost everything. Even with huge bets, that would take a long time. Marcum simulated the match in detailed hand written notes. Kashiwagi might surge ahead early, he estimated, but after 75 hours at the table â\\x80\\x93 far longer than he had stayed the first time - his chances of winning would fall to 15 percent. The key was to prevent a repeat of Kashiwagiâ\\x80\\x99s first visit, when he had walked out while ahead.\\nKashiwagi, presumably fuzzier on the probabilities, agreed to the terms. There was no legal way to hold him to such a deal but Trump felt the men were honor-bound. â\\x80\\x9cGamblers are honorable, in their own wayâ\\x80\\x94at least about gambling,â\\x80\\x9d he later wrote.\\n***\\nKashiwagi returned to Trump Plaza in May, and Trump was again on the casino floor. And once again, his Japanese rival hit an early winning streak. One Trump biographer, Harry Hurt III, described the mogul as â\\x80\\x9cimpolitely â\\x80\\x98sweating the actionâ\\x80\\x99 in view of Kashiwagi and the other patronsâ\\x80\\x9d before excusing himself. After falling behind another $9 millionâ\\x80\\x94now $15 million in total over the two sessionsâ\\x80\\x94a stunned Trump considered stopping the game. But Marcum convinced him to be patient and wait for the probabilities to work.\\nThe gambling continued for more than five days. In Comeback, Trump recalled hearing from a pit manager that Kashiwagi hit a major losing streak, by pure chance, after his dealers changed from a team of men to a team of women. Losing faith in his expert-generated odds, Trump now seized on the only thing he had left: superstition: â\\x80\\x9cI want those women dealing to this guy all the time,â\\x80\\x9d Trump insisted. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t give a damn if itâ\\x80\\x99s a coincidence or not.â\\x80\\x9d The mogul even called the women directly to make clear he expected them to stay at the table.\\nTrumpâ\\x80\\x99s account, written years later, here diverges significantly from others. In his telling, the Kashiwagi saga unfolded over one epic visit. But several other fuller accountsâ\\x80\\x94including Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnellâ\\x80\\x99s detailed recollection and newspaper reports from the timeâ\\x80\\x94clearly describe two separate Kashiwagi trips to Atlantic City.\\nOne thing everyone agrees on is that Trump\\'s fortunes took a sudden turn, just as Marcum had predicted. After six days, Trump was up $10 million, meaning heâ\\x80\\x99d won back the $6 million from Kashiwagiâ\\x80\\x99s February visit plus another $4 million.\\nBut there is also disagreement over what happened next. â\\x80\\x9cRemembering our deal, I told my people to stop the play.â\\x80\\x9d Trump wrote in Comeback. Kashiwagi â\\x80\\x9cwas not particularly happy about this,â\\x80\\x9d Trump recalled, â\\x80\\x9cbut he agreed.â\\x80\\x9d Here Trump cited the gamblersâ\\x80\\x99 credo: â\\x80\\x9cWhen a deal is made, they usually abide by it.â\\x80\\x9d\\nKashiwagi saw things very differently. His aide told reporters that Trump had dishonorably violated their deal by calling off the game early. The deal had reportedly been for play to continue until Kashiwagi either won or lost $12 million. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s not what happened: Trump called the game after $10 million. \\nItâ\\x80\\x99s not clear, then, why Trump would later write that he was â\\x80\\x9c[r]emembering our deal\"â\\x80\\x94or why he would say that Kashiwagi agreed to stop play. But if Trump did change the terms of a deal at the last minute, it would not be for the first or last time. \\nKashiwagi departed in a rage, with his aide announcing plans for that autographed copy of Art of the Deal. â\\x80\\x9cWe are going to burn it soon,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nTrump might not have cared, except that Kashiwagi owed him a lot of money. He had been playing on credit, and left before a $6 million check drawn from a Singapore bank had cleared. Though the facts are unclear, the check apparently bounced or Kashiwagi canceled it. Trump executives publicly threatened lawsuits. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s account in Comeback never mentions any of this, although concerns about his guestâ\\x80\\x99s credit could explain his decision to end their showdown prematurely.\\nKashiwagi suggested that Trump, then in significant debt himself, was the one with a credit problem. His aide told the Journal that Trump Plaza had offered his boss a $5,000 shopping spree at Macyâ\\x80\\x99s in Atlantic Cityâ\\x80\\x94but that the store had rejected Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s credit at the register.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe pity Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s creditors,â\\x80\\x9d said the aide. â\\x80\\x9cNo wonder if they panic.â\\x80\\x9d Eventually, they did. All three of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s Atlantic City casinos were bankrupt by 1992. But Akio Kashiwagi didnâ\\x80\\x99t get to enjoy it. He was murdered in early January of that year.\\nIn Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s telling, it was Kashiwagiâ\\x80\\x99s visit to his casino that effectively ruined the secretive gamblerâ\\x80\\x99s life. He returned home to a media frenzy in Tokyo over his Atlantic City adventure. â\\x80\\x9cOne day he completely lost it,â\\x80\\x9d Trump wrote. â\\x80\\x9cHe ran outside to get away from two television cameras peering into his window. He tripped over the curb and broke his ankle. His chauffer pulled him into his black Mercedes and sped off.â\\x80\\x9d\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKashiwagi went into hiding and was never seen again until his body was found hacked to pieces by a samurai sword,â\\x80\\x9d Trump continued. â\\x80\\x9cThey never caught the killers.â\\x80\\x9d \\nJapanese authorities did make an arrest in the case, charging a man the Los Angeles Times described as \"a reputed local gangster\" acquainted with Kashiwagi\\'s son. The motive was unclear, but Japanese media noted that the killer did not steal Kashiwagiâ\\x80\\x99s diamonds or the hundreds of thousands of dollars stashed in the house. \\nIn a statement to POLITICO, Trump expressed respect for Kashiwagi (though no remorse for his death). â\\x80\\x9cI loved our matches with him,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said. â\\x80\\x9cHe was a great player who loved big numbers. He made me a lot of money when money was very tight and the economy was crashing.â\\x80\\x9d\\nBut itâ\\x80\\x99s not clear that Kashiwagi made Trump any money at all. The final ledger is murky. But if Kashiwagi won $6 million on his first trip to Atlantic City, then lost $10 millionâ\\x80\\x94and died owing Trump $4 million, then Trump at best broke even. If reports that Kashiwagi cashed in nearly $500,000 in chips on his way out of the casino are correct, then Trump finished in the red. \\nTrump did get the media attention that had always been part of his plan. But it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t enough to save the Trump Plaza or any of his other properties. Within a couple of years Trump would limp out of Atlantic City altogether, narrowly escaping personal bankruptcy. His great gambleâ\\x80\\x94on Kashiwagi, and on gambling itselfâ\\x80\\x94can hardly be called a success. Only in Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s world can that kind of wager be called a win.\\n Correction: This story originally described Jess Marcum as a co-founder of the RAND Corporation.

The Republican frontrunner in the US primaries told people working with him to help find a company known for producing quality merchandise on a mass scale. In the end, Mr Trump signed on with Phillips-Van Heusen, a manufacturer of affordable shirts produced in factories in 85 countries. The 2004 deal - one of the first of many merchandise-licensing arrangements in which Mr Trump attached his name to products made by foreign workers and sold in the US - is relevant today as the billionaire businessman wages a populist presidential campaign in which he accuses companies of killing US jobs by moving manufacturing plants overseas to take advantage of cheap labour and lax workplace regulations.   Documents and interviews reveal the personal role that Mr Trump played in negotiating the deal. Participants said they could not recall Mr Trump expressing a preference that products be made in the US.

Even as Mr Trump is trying to quash criticism of violence by his supporters, the contradiction between Mr Trump\\'s business decisions and his political agenda illustrates the sometimes-awkward transformation of an aggressive, profit-oriented marketer and real estate mogul into a firebrand champion of the struggling working class.

Credit:AP    When Mr Trump began cutting licensing deals more than a decade ago, many business executives and politicians in both parties argued that free trade and overseas production were beneficial to everyone - a needed boost for poor, developing economies abroad and a path to cheap goods for middle-class consumers in the US. Mr Trump, though, has emerged as the Republican presidential front-runner largely by tapping into growing anger among many voters who think more-liberal trade policies - such as the ones that have added to Trump\\'s personal fortune - have devastated US communities that have lost manufacturing jobs to Mexico, China and elsewhere.

Trump supporters line up for a rally in Florida on Sunday. Credit:AP    When news broke three weeks ago that Carrier was moving 1400 jobs from a plant in Indianapolis to Monterrey, Mexico, Mr Trump wrote on Facebook: \"We cannot allow this to keep happening. It will NOT happen under my watch.\" Moreover, Mr Trump has mentioned labour conditions overseas in support of his position that goods should be made in the US, telling CNN last year that Chinese labourers are \"paid a lot less and the standards are worse when it comes to the environment and health care and worker safety\".   Mr Trump has embraced the disconnect. As he explained during a Republican debate last week, he knows how to fix the policies that encourage outsourcing because he spent so many years successfully taking advantage of them. \"Nobody knows it better than me,\" he said. \"I\\'m a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We\\'re allowed to do it. . . . But I\\'m the one that knows how to change it.\" Mr Trump\\'s rivals for the Republican nomination have tried - so far to no avail - to undercut his popularity among working-class voters by portraying him as someone who rampantly outsources jobs. A similar line of attack proved effective four years ago against then-GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Senatior Marco Rubio, a rival in the primary campaign, has called on Mr Trump to announce that \"all the Donald Trump clothing will no longer be made in China and in Mexico but will be made here in the United States\". Mr Trump dismissed the statement, arguing that China\\'s currency policies \"make it impossible for clothing makers in this country to do clothing in this country\". After Mr Trump drew scrutiny over the summer for disparaging comments about Mexican immigrants, Macy\\'s, which sold his clothing line, announced it was ending its relationship with him. Phillips-Van Heusen, now called PVH Corp., quickly followed suit, saying that its licensing deal with Trump would be unwound.   Dana Perlman, a spokeswoman for the company, said this week that it no longer manufactures Trump clothing and declined to comment further.

Trump is extraordinarily thin-skinned; he can\\'t seem to let any attack roll off him. So last Tuesday he spent lots of time explaining why his various branding ventures — not just Trump U but also Trump Steaks, Trump Vodka, and many others — were not cons, but the most premium-quality experiences its customers ever had. But I suspect Trump wasn\\'t all that insulted by being called a con artist; his business is about branding and myth-making, and he knows that there\\'s a fine line between a con man and a great salesman. What Trump really couldn\\'t tolerate is being the guy on the other end of the con: a sucker. The fear of being a sucker seems to be one of the prime motivating forces in Trump\\'s entire life, one that shapes not only his business career, but how he views the country. In the recent biography Never Enough, author Michael D\\'Antonio singles out an event that occurred when Trump was a freshman in college as a seminal moment. Attending the opening of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge with his father, Trump saw how the elderly architect who designed the bridge, Othmar Ammann, was ignored by developer Robert Moses during the ceremony, not listed among the people Moses thanked. \"The lesson Trump took away was that somehow Ammann was to blame for being overlooked,\" D\\'Antonio writes. \"Trump decided he would remember the incident because \\'I don\\'t want to be made anybody\\'s sucker.\\'\" And suckers are worthy of nothing but contempt. That\\'s what animates Trump\\'s deal-making as he sees it — is he the sucker, or is the other guy? A sucker is someone who doesn\\'t understand the balance of power, who gets taken advantage of by someone smarter, who\\'s humiliated, emasculated, and ridiculed. It isn\\'t a surprise that Trump was drawn to the casino business, where every day millions of dollars are made by casino owners taking money from suckers who don\\'t understand that the game is rigged against them.   With that in mind, listen to how Trump talks about America and how it relates to other countries. For Trump, relations between countries, particularly when it comes to trade, are really just a question of who\\'s the sucker. And as he sees it, it\\'s us. For instance, you could view China or Mexico as nations that have pursued a growth model based on low-wage manufacturing, utilizing the comparative advantage they enjoy at this point (lots of people eager to work for not much money). But Trump sees only a con game, one where not only are we the marks, but — and this is critical — they\\'re laughing at us. \"If you don\\'t tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the United States and laughing at our stupidity,\" he said at Thursday\\'s debate, \"we\\'re going to continue to lose businesses and we\\'re going to continue to lose jobs.\" The idea that trade is not exactly a zero-sum game — for instance, that American consumers benefit from being able to buy imported goods at low cost — is not part of his calculation. Trump brings up the idea of other countries laughing at us so often that in January, The Washington Post charted over 100 instances of Trump asserting that others are laughing at America, from China (the biggest laugher, apparently) to OPEC to Mexico to Iran. Often he\\'ll just say that \"the whole world\" is laughing at us, which is the sucker\\'s ultimate fear: not just that you got scammed, but that everyone knows it, and points their fingers at you in mockery. When Mitt Romney gave a speech earlier this month attempting to dissuade Republicans from voting for Trump, he said, \"He\\'s playing members of the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat.\" Romney may be closer to Trump in this way than you\\'d think; in 2012, when he got asked about his low tax rate, he would say, \"I pay all the taxes that are legally required and not a dollar more. I don\\'t think you want someone as the candidate for president who pays more taxes than he owes.\" In other words, only a sucker wouldn\\'t hire a team of accountants to find every last loophole in the tax code, and how could someone like that be president? I can\\'t help but think that there\\'s a part of Donald Trump that doesn\\'t really mind when someone like Romney calls him a con man, so long as nobody takes it too seriously. Sure, he doesn\\'t want Americans to think that he\\'s just running a scam on them. But there\\'s one thing a lot worse than being the one pulling the con, and that\\'s being the one who got conned. Because then people might laugh at you.

True story -- as true as those thousands and thousands of Muslims in Jersey City, New Jersey he saw cheering on TV as the World Trade Center came tumbling down. It happened at Mar-a-Lago, not long after Trump bought the place. He wasn\\'t asking me about the real estate, though. He wanted to know what I thought about Li\\'l Donald. Back then, I could never have imagined he\\'d be running for president one day, or that I\\'d be privileged to vote for him. Or that Li\\'l Donald was the pet name that he\\'d given his d*ck, or that its size would turn out to be a campaign issue.  The size of his fortune? Sure, anyone could see that fight coming. If you don\\'t release your tax returns, some total loser is bound to say you\\'re stuffing a sock in your package.  But this Rubio salvo about Trump having small hands: That one took me by surprise.  You\\'d think Trump\\'s answer would have put away any doubts about how he measures up. \"I guarantee you there\\'s no problem. I guarantee it.\"  What\\'s not good enough about that? For millions of people during the primaries, that\\'s worked just fine for every other issue. Believe me, Mexico will pay for the wall. Believe me, torture works. The world is going to respect us again, believe me. I\\'ll bring those jobs back from China, India, Vietnam and Mexico, believe me. You\\'re going to see Merry Christmas in the department stores, believe me. Believe me, I\\'m a unifier. I hate to say it, but when it comes to his size, I\\'m afraid \"I guarantee it\" just isn\\'t going to stifle the suspicions. You know what\\'s bound to happen: When some network offers some former arm candy of his a reality show, she\\'s going to break the nondisclosure agreement he made her sign about Li\\'l Donald. Or maybe some embarrassing picture is going to go viral, and it won\\'t matter how many times he says, \"It\\'s been Photoshopped, believe me.\"   America needs Trump. The only way to pre-empt attacks like that is the truth, whatever it is. And better that truth come from a supporter like me than some lying loser trying to bring him down.   When Trump bought Mar-a-Lago, it was a wreck. This was in the \\'80s, when I used to go there to visit my girlfriend. He\\'d hired her to turn it into a swanky spa, and one of his conditions -- I wasn\\'t crazy about it, but the money was good -- was that she live on the property during the renovation. I didn\\'t want our relationship to suffer more than it had to, so I flew down to Palm Beach every month or so and stayed with her in a little cottage on the grounds.   It was dilapidated, but tolerable, except for the plumbing. If you wanted a decent shower, forget it. In those days, I was running two or three miles a day, and the last thing I wanted to do was clean the sweat off with a washcloth and water from a kettle on the hotplate. So I took to sneaking into the men\\'s locker room over by the tennis courts, where the pressure and the water were good and hot, and no one was ever around. But one morning, after a good long run, when I pushed open the locker room door I found myself face to face with two guys peeling off their sticky tennis whites. I didn\\'t recognize the big blond guy -- a tennis pro? -- but the other one was Trump. He had on a Lacoste shirt and a chain around his neck, and nothing else.  \"Who the f**k are you?\" he asked.  \"I\\'m Katrina\\'s boyfriend,\" I said. \"Nice to meet you, sir.\" I almost put my hand out to shake his, but under the circumstances it didn\\'t seem right to get any closer.   \"Katrina?\" the pro asked.  \"My spa designer,\" Trump told him. \"The ---- this putz is f--king.\" I tried to keep my eyes locked on his, but I must have glanced downward, and he nailed me. Guys don\\'t like to admit it, but we can\\'t help checking each other out. It\\'s kind of an alpha thing.  \"What are you looking at?\" Trump asked. It was actually the whiteness that had caught my eye. No, really. It wasn\\'t just that he wasn\\'t spray-tanned down there. It was also hairless as a baby\\'s butt. \"Nothing, sir.\" I was looking straight at him again, but I\\'d heard that shaving is supposed to be a way to make you look larger, and I couldn\\'t get what I\\'d seen out of my mind. \"You calling Li\\'l Donald \\'nothing,\\' boy?\" \"No, sir, I\\'m not. I\\'m, I\\'m --\" I stammered. \"Go ahead. Look at it.\" \"No, really, I -- \"  \"I said, look at it.\"  You know how, when he was asked in the debate last week what he would do if the military refused to obey an order from him to use torture, he said, \"They\\'re not gonna refuse me, believe me\" -- do you remember that? That\\'s how I felt right then. I couldn\\'t refuse him. So I looked. \"Do you like what you see?\"  They say that some guys are growers and some are showers. Trump was definitely not a shower. But it wasn\\'t obvious that he was a grower, either. There just wasn\\'t enough to go on to say. \"I said,\" he repeated, \"Do you like what you see, you little ---- ?\" Talk about trick questions.  No way could I say no. But yes? Based on what was visible, yes was manifestly unbelievable. Worse, it conveyed a level of enthusiasm that could only get me in more trouble. \"Yes, sir,\" I lied. Double lied. \"I do.\" \"Liar. You\\'re lying. He\\'s lyin\\', Ivan,\" he said to the pro.  Trump fixed me with that squinty look he sometimes has. I felt as though he were x-raying my mind. \"There\\'s only one right answer.\" \"Sir?\" \"\\'I have to see all of it,\\'\" he said. \"\\'Show me all of it.\\' That\\'s the right answer. Isn\\'t that right, Ivan?\" \"Da,\" Ivan said. \"Did I show you all of it?\" Trump asked him. It was clearly a rhetorical question. \"Tell him, Ivan.\" \"Da.\"  I should mention that during all of this, Ivan had not stopped undressing. By now I could see that Ivan had an enormous -- well, that his hands were yuge. It gave him some real standing on the topic. \"And did you like what you saw, Ivan?\" A dreamy smile suffused his face. He turned to me. \"Tre-men-dous,\" he said, lingering on each syllable. \"Belief me.\"  I did. It was like a command relayed from the commander-in-chief, an order I couldn\\'t refuse.  The two presidential candidates this fall are likely to be Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. There\\'s going to be a lot of back and forth about immigration and trade and all the other hot-button issues. But in the end, the presidential vote always comes down to, Which one of them do you believe? Do you believe she\\'s really going to take on Wall Street? Do you believe he\\'ll really make China roll over? Clinton\\'s supporters can speak to the question of her credibility. But as a Trump guy, I can\\'t think of a better sign of his trustworthiness -- and I\\'m speaking from personal experience here -- than what he\\'s been saying in this campaign about Li\\'l Donald. True, I may not have seen all of it, and I certainly didn\\'t whip out a ruler to measure it. But the smile that day on that tennis pro\\'s face is all the affidavit I need. Trump really is going to make America great again. I guarantee it.  Related  primaries GOP make america great again Donald Trump Satire       The Republican candidate’s political rise is an inversion of his story arc on Monday Night Raw.      Carlos Osorio / AP        Updated on March 15, 2016   Even this deep into the primaries, has anyone gotten Donald Trump quite right? The comparisons to fascist ideologues don’t quite work because of his reputation for disingenuousness. The impulse to dismiss him as pure “entertainment” or to discount his chances doesn’t quite work, either, because of the real, tangible current of American sentiment that supports him. But maybe commentators are just looking for answers in the wrong places. Perhaps no good historical political analogy to Trump exists. The key to understanding Trump, instead, could be the dirty, violent, machismo-laden world of his business past. Not real estate or reality TV—but professional wrestling. Really. Many other commentators, including my colleague James Fallows have noted Trump’s history with wrestling and drawn parallels between it and his political career. But that history seems even more salient now that violence has become such an important issue on the trail. Trump’s involvement with wrestling dates back 27 years, when World Wrestling Entertainment was still the World Wrestling Federation, and his casino helped bring its flagship pay-per-view event WrestleMania IV to New Jersey. His subsequent involvement in wrestling and his friendship with the WWE boss and fellow billionaire Vince McMahon have been well chronicled, but Trump’s true moment in the spotlight—and in the ring—came during the 2007 “Battle of the Billionaires” story arc, in which he actually played the good guy “babyface” (or “face”) counterpart to McMahon’s “heel,” or villain. In wrestling, most heels are incorrigible self-promoting jerks who often use below-the-belt moves and taunts. Babyfaces tend to be All-American types that play it straight. That arc saw a long run-up to the match between Trump and McMahon on episodes of the weekly show Monday Night Raw, featuring phallic boasts, celebrity endorsements, crowd-pleasing grandstanding, lots of bloody violence, and constant references to polls by Trump. He consistently botched lines and forgot the names of his endorsements and partners, a fact that only further endeared him to crowds. It ended at WrestleMania, with Trump giving McMahon a clothesline takedown and a haircut (an actual haircut, not a fancy wrestling move), and with Trump suffering a brutal stunner move at the hands of the beer-swilling Bionic Redneck and guest referee, Stone Cold Steve Austin. Although all the pieces don’t quite fit, and nobody expects Trump to deliver a signature wrestling move at the convention (although this year, nothing seems out of the realm of possibility), doesn’t this sound familiar? This past weekend made clear that the campaign is following a different story arc, with Donald “The Don” Trump now playing the heel, instead of the babyface persona he used in WrestleMania. Breitbart News suffered a potential schism over an alleged assault of journalist Michelle Fields at a Trump rally, protests stopped a Trump rally in Chicago, and Trump seemed to endorse the violence of his supporters and threaten other candidates with them. For heels in the ring, crassness is the norm, 7th-grade put-downs carry the weight of Socrates, violence is always the answer, women are hypersexualized and insulted, all publicity is good publicity, personas are created and shed as often as costumes, racial stereotypes are often played for laughs or fear, and the only cheap shots are the ones that referees see. “The Don” has mastered these elements in his path to the title. Like other legendary heels at their best—Mankind displaying the outer limits of human pain tolerance and endurance in a cage or Kane trapping his brother in the underworld—Trump has parlayed a messy, bloody, royal rumble of a primary fight into success as the Republican frontrunner. Trump’s improbable political career has always been oddly close to the world of wrestling. One earlier bid for president came in 2000 on the Reform Party, a potpourri of strange bedfellows including billionaire Ross Perot, Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, and Pat Buchanan. The party had just pulled off its first major victory in the election of Jesse Ventura as the Governor of Minnesota in 1998. Ventura, known in the ring as “The Body,” entered politics after a career as a wrestler in the WWE/F. He turned down an opportunity to lead the national Reform Party ticket, instead recommending that Trump challenge Buchanan’s hold on the Reform Party leadership as its candidate. Where did Trump and Ventura meet? WrestleMania . Trump the wrestler helped create Trump the politician. The 2000 candidacy would not last beyond its exploratory phase because of deep internal policy and leadership fractures in the famously ill-fated party, but Trump emerged with the lessons from his own campaign—and perhaps Ventura’s career. Americans cared about the show, even if it was sometimes scripted. Trump’s involvement in both professional wrestling and politics would continue, including a later arc and induction into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013 that saw him make some of his earliest statements about his ambition for a 2016 run. McMahon announced, “Donald might very well be a great president of the United States.” Trump wanted to take his showman’s talents, which were natural gifts in the sweat-soaked soap opera of Raw and WrestleMania, on to the next show. And so on the campaign trail, “The Don” became the perfect heel. “The Don” holds rallies where people are punched in the face. “The Don” makes mama and short jokes about opponents while bragging about his genitals on stage. “The Don” calls women ugly to their face and makes crude menstruation jokes. All he’s really missing is a steel chair or two, and who’s to say that isn’t coming? This doesn’t mean that Trump’s ascent should be any less alarming or that it should be treated as anything less than real political news with serious, long-term global and domestic repercussions. Indeed, viewing Trump through this lens should be even more alarming. Some in the media refuse to take his campaign seriously or have labeled it entertainment, and some still wring their hands and call his open bigotry and endorsement of violence un-American. But Trump’s heel turn plays on well-established and very American chords of racism, fear, and xenophobia. Trump is willing to take the stances he needs to win, but there is no guarantee that he won’t continue that same brand of crowd-pleasing showmanship if elected. A yuge wall? No problem! He’ll fly to Mexico himself and intimidate the country into paying for it. But what if the winds of popular opinion shift in favor of something even darker than deportation? Would Trump have the integrity to withstand such popular demands? The key to Donald Trump is that he understands what many Americans crave in an era of cynicism about the political process: a show that both promises high-flying acts and subtly acknowledges the wires involved. He’s so willing to dive into such a clearly created character that even his disingenuousness is transformed into a kind of earnestness. And like any good heel, it is hard to stop him by either playing it straight or attempting to out-heel him. So, how does one stop a heel? Perhaps Trump’s own babyface campaign against McMahon might serve as an example. The carefully scripted “Battle of the Billionaires” arc centered on Trump as the hero of fans who had become disgruntled with McMahon’s tenure. As Trump’s real-life rallies and events openly carry the stain of violence, and as the establishment continues to question the merits of an endorsement, it may be disgruntled Republicans and independents, even those who once supported Trump, who provide the three-count. But with polls still forecasting favorable results in Florida and a close race in Ohio, don’t expect Trump to hit rock bottom any time soon.        RALEIGH, N.C. — Donald Trump praised former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein Tuesday night, allowing that he was a \"really bad guy\" but had redeeming qualities when it came to his handling of terrorists. Trump lauded the former U.S. adversary for how \"well\" he killed terrorists, recalling that he \"didn\\'t read them the rights, they didn’t talk. They were terrorists, over.\" Now, Trump assessed, \"Iraq is Harvard for terrorism. You want to be a terrorist, you go to Iraq.\" Hillary Clinton\\'s campaign seized the opportunity to once more paint Trump has unfit for office. \"Donald Trump’s praise for brutal strongmen seemingly knows no bounds,\" Senior Policy Advisor Jake Sullivan said in an emailed statement. \"Trump\\'s cavalier compliments for brutal dictators, and the twisted lessons he seems to have learned from their history, again demonstrate how dangerous he would be as commander-in-chief and how unworthy he is of the office he seeks.\"  Related: Trump Calls FBI Decision on Clinton a \\'Tragedy\\'   This isn’t the first time Trump has cast the brutal dictator in a positive light — or called Iraq an Ivy League locale for aspiring terrorists. Throughout the primaries Trump glossed over Hussein’s violent history in favor of what he viewed as a more stable Middle East ruled by Saddam’s viciousness.     In an October exclusive with NBC’s Chuck Todd, Trump asserted that the Middle East would be better off today if Moammar Gadhafi of Libya and Saddam Hussein were still in power. \"It’s not even a contest,\" Trump told Meet the Press. Trump continued to push this idea at a rally in Franklin, Tennessee, telling the crowd that despite Hussein\\'s \"vicious\" rule in Iraq \"there were no terrorists in Iraq\" while he ruled. \"You know what he used to do to terrorists?\" Trump polled the Tennessee crowd. \"A one day trial and shoot him…and the one day trial usually lasted five minutes, right? There was no terrorism then.\" Trump didn’t just praise Hussein for keeping terrorists at bay, but seemed to tacitly accept the dictator\\'s use of chemical weapons. During a December rally in Hilton Head, South Carolina, Trump took a cavalier attitude toward Iraq\\'s use of chemical weapons under Saddam. \"Saddam Hussein throws a little gas, everyone goes crazy, \\'oh he’s using gas!\\'\" Trump said. Describing the way stability was maintained in the region during that time, Trump said \"they go back, forth, it’s the same. And they were stabilized.\" Trump lamented how the United States intervened in the region during a speech in South Carolina late last year. \"if you go after one or the other, in this case Iraq, you’re going to destabilize the Middle East. That’s what’s going to happen,\" he said. On Tuesday night, at rally focusing heavily on Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama, Trump revived the old riffs from his primary playbook. \"We shouldn’t have destabilized Saddam Hussein, right? He was a bad guy, really bad guy, but you know what he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good.\" Trump’s statements were noteworthy for the company he made them in. At Trump’s side Tuesday: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, who was on the trail with Trump for the day. Corker is being vetted for vice president and his trail time in North Carolina was considered by many to be an audition.

Donald Trump likes his steak cooked to a crisp.   \"It would rock on the plate, it was so well done,\" Anthony Senecal, Trump\\'s long-time butler, told The New York Times.  You may hate him for his lies or for his racism, but now you can hate him for how he takes his filet mignon. It\\'s almost as if he\\'s threatened by any possible life remaining in the meat. Trump wants everything he eats to be really, really, really dead.  Trump\\'s steak preference is considered offensive by most people who have an ounce of appreciation for food.  It\\'s one of the biggest crimes a person can commit while dining out. Steaks ordered \"well-done\" have been known to crinkle the noses of talented chefs.   \"WHY! Why don\\'t you just eat a burger!\", is what Peter D\\'Antonio, the executive chef of The Westin Waltham-Boston wishes he could say to those who order steaks like Trump. The Daily Meal goes as far to say that anyone who like their steaks well-done is a \"bad person.\" In Trump\\'s case ...  Let\\'s forget about taste for a minute and talk about health. Eating over-cooked meat can mess with your memory. A 2014 study from New York’s Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai found that consuming a lot of glycotoxins, which are found in excess in well-done meat, raises a person\\'s risk for age-related dementia. To rub a little more salt in the wound, a separate study revealed that men who eat a lot of ground beef and other red meat -- particularly if the meat is well-done -- are at higher risk for aggressive prostate cancer. Trump is basically making himself sick.  Finally, remember that Trump sold his own steaks, \"Trump Steaks,\" at Sharper Image in 2007.       Sharper Image   And he believed the above would be a good way to market said steaks. When you cast your vote for president this year, think about how the candidates interact with the world on a more intimate level. What would they do if they saw a stray dog on the side of the road? Would they be willing to let someone else take the last spot in the elevator, and wait for the next? How would they navigate a menu at a nice meal out? Remember: We are what we eat.

WASHINGTON — Donald Trump, apparently concerned the deadly blizzard was infringing on his media coverage, said Saturday that\\xa0he is so popular, he could shoot someone and not lose voters. Addressing a campaign rally in Sioux Center, Iowa, Trump bragged that his \"people\" are the most loyal. \"I\\xa0could stand in the\\xa0middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I\\xa0wouldn\\'t\\xa0lose any voters, okay? It\\'s,\\xa0like, incredible,\" Trump said. And in a move that any kindergartner knows would get them in trouble at school, Trump pointed his finger\\xa0like a gun and cocked his thumb, just to illustrate how such a scenario might play\\xa0out\\xa0in Manhattan. Trump\\'s\\xa0audience, for the record, laughed.    Donald Trump is loud and boastful on camera, but sometimes he operates more quietly off screen, like when he needed to solve a sewage problem beneath the streets of Manhattan—a problem that mysteriously evaporated one day in 1994, allowing a flood of cash that saved Trump from drowning in debt. This is a little-known aspect of how Trump bungled the chance to make billions of dollars building on the largest developable tract of land in America’s largest city, a story the late actor Christopher Reeve called “the American dream gone berserk.”  Way back in 1974, when Trump was not yet 30 years old, he acquired control of the old Penn Central rail yards on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. For a song, he had 57 acres of land along the Hudson River that ran 13 blocks from 59th Street to 72nd Street. Years later, after enough machinations to fill a Tolstoy novel, Trump proposed high-density residential apartment buildings mixed with other uses, notably new television studios for NBC, a project he called Television City. He also proposed the world’s tallest building, a 154-story skyscraper that would have cast long shadows over Central Park and much of the Upper West Side every sunny afternoon. That giant erection was what drew Superman’s ire. That was a little problem for Trump. His big one was sewage. As recently as 1986 most of the sewage generated in Manhattan flowed raw into the Hudson River, almost as if the city was the New Amsterdam of the 17th century with a few million more people emptying their chamber pots in the streets each morning. The city partially solved this problem by building a new sewage treatment plant. It was originally intended for the boat basin at 79th Street, but politically savvy and affluent Upper West Siders got their effluent pumped north to the Harlem waterfront, where the smell was godawful. About 200 million gallons of sewage came in each day to the sewage treatment plan, well above its design capacity of around 170 million gallons per day. So on dry days, about 30 million gallons of raw sewage continued flowing into the Hudson River. Rainy days swelled the volume. Ruth Messinger, the Manhattan borough president at the time, was adamant that no development would take place on the Trump property without proper sewage treatment for the estimated five million gallons per day his project was expected to generate. Messinger wrote a 1992 letter to the city environmental commissioner saying a “host of experts” agreed with her that Trump’s project should not get approved “unless there is sustainable, reliable, and certain commitment to mitigate the anticipated sewage flows” (PDF). Days later, Messinger testified that “there is no justification” for any claims that the existing sewage plant could handle the flushed toilets and other wastewater from 5,700 new apartments. Messinger, the Coalition for a Livable Upper West Side, and others stood firm. No Trump project would proceed until sewage inflows matched treatment capacity. Then something strange happened, something that would have gone unnoticed but for one Princeton-trained civil engineer checking the weekly city sewage flow reports. The document showed 24 million gallons less sewage on the Upper West Side. Rich Herschlag, Messinger’s chief borough engineer, thought it an inside-the-bureaucracy joke. It was, after all, April Fool’s Day 1994. When the next weekly report came Herschlag realized this was no joke. Day after day, rain or shine, the official sewage flow meter readings stayed about the same. Holidays, big events that drew people into the city, weekends when people left town—none of that influenced the effluent flow. “It was as if 150,000 Manhattanites just vanished,” Herschlag told me last week. Either that or Upper West Siders all stopped flushing, showering, and washing the dishes. Just to be sure, I checked the news clips. There were no stories about incredibly stinky New Yorkers riding the West Side subway lines as summer heat enveloped Manhattan in 1994. Eventually the United States Attorney for Manhattan, Mary Jo White, launched an investigation into the missing sewage. Herschlag meanwhile got busy trying to figure out how the system was being manipulated, complaining that something foul must be going on and asking how much it would take to bribe someone to play games with the sewer meters and computer software that continuously tracked sewage flows. About this time Messinger, hailed by many as a great liberal reformer and voice of integrity, decided to run for mayor. Herschlag got muzzled. He was told to stop carping about an insignificant issue that no one else cared about. Eventually Herschlag was forced out of his job, his final paycheck held up until he could be told that were he to consult with the Coalition for a Livable Upper West Side, which opposed the Trump project, he could be prosecuted for violating a city charter ethics rule. That’s when the best reporter in New York City, Wayne Barrett of the Village Voice, and one of his acolytes, Denise Kiernan, got on the story. On April 11, 1995, they published an article about “Ruth and Donald’s Artful Deal” (PDF). They exposed connections between Trump and various elected and appointed city officials that were as complex, and hidden, as the sewer lines running beneath city streets. For example, a former city councilman from the West Side named Ed Wallace registered as a lobbyist for Trump Management. New York’s Parks Council, which would have to approve a park for Trump’s project to proceed, was packed with officials and spouses on the Trump payroll. Messinger did a complete reversal, becoming an advocate for the Trump project that she had once so firmly opposed since there was no longer, or so it seemed, a problem of overloading the already overloaded sewage treatment plant with more wastewater. Indeed, she said in February 1995 that she had not called for preventing sewer hookups at the proposed Trump project. Mary Jo White, the federal prosecutor who is now chair of the federal Securities & Exchange Commission, dropped her inquiry. She has never been willing to answer questions about what motivated her reversal, including whether any instruction flowed down to her from the Bill Clinton White House, which at the time Trump courted and publicly supported. Herschlag went on to a fine career on his own. He eventually figured out how the sewer flow reports were manipulated to make 24 million gallons of filthy water a day seem to evaporate. It may be the raw sewage was simply diverted into the Hudson River, but Herschlag believes another answer is highly likely. He learned that there are two independent sets of sewage flow data. One is from the collector pipes, the other at the entry to the treatment plant. Herschlag believes someone tampered with the plant intake meter, but neglected to fudge the collector-pipe meters so their numbers would match, either out of hubris—what are the odds someone would compare the two?—or laziness. He later wrote a novel,  The Interceptor, about “a sly real estate mogul with a $4 billion deal at stake, a ruthless candidate for mayor in a heated election year and a lone civil engineer who uncovers a secret that could rock the lives of seven million New Yorkers.” It sold about 45,000 copies, an amazing number for a thriller about sewers. You can still buy a copy, for a penny plus shipping. The end of the story came in 1997 when Trump sold most of his interest in the land to Hong Kong investors. No one would have paid a penny if the land could not be developed because there was no place for it in a sewer system that was already full—showing once again how Trump speaks the truth when he talks about how a businessman who delivers campaign cash and favors gets politicians to do what he wants.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Donald Trump responds to \\'small hands\\' insult\\n \\n 01:57\\n \\n - Source:\\n CNN\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n  \\n Washington\\n CNN\\n \\xa0—\\xa0\\n \\n\\n \\n Republican front-runner Donald Trump on Tuesday brushed aside demeaning comments from Marco Rubio about the size of his hands, saying others disagree with the Florida senator.\\n \\n \\n “He said I have small hands – I’m actually 6’3”, not 6’2” – but I’ve always heard people say, ‘Donald, you have the most beautiful hands,’ ” Trump said at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, on Super Tuesday.\\n \\n \\n Trump was responding to an unusual attack from Rubio over the weekend. \\n \\n \\n “He’s always calling me Little Marco. And I’ll admit he’s taller than me. He’s like 6’2”, which is why I don’t understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 5’2”,” Rubio said at a rally in Virginia Sunday night. “And you know what they say about men with small hands? You can’t trust them.”\\n \\n \\n \\n It was just one of a series of personal attacks that Rubio has made in the last few days about Trump.\\n \\n \\n New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has endorsed Trump, also took a jab at Rubio at an Ohio rally on Tuesday. \\n \\n \\n “Sen. Rubio is on the air of desperate,” said Christie, who dropped out of the presidential race after the New Hampshire primary. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Marty Rosenberg has sat across the negotiating table from Donald Trump, and he says it cost his business nearly a half-million dollars when the man who currently reigns as the Republican presidential front-runner didn’t live up to his end of the deal.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n The year was 1990, and Mr. Trump’s newly constructed Taj Mahal hotel and casino was hurtling toward bankruptcy, while Mr. Rosenberg’s Atlantic Plate Glass (APG) and scores of other contractors who built the lavish megacasino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, waited for more than $60 million in overdue payments.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n “We got to the end of the job, and I think he owed APG about $1.5 million,” Mr. Rosenberg recalled in a recent interview. “I was waiting for my check, and it didn’t come.”\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Mr. Rosenberg, who was vice president of Atlantic Plate Glass at the time, helped form a committee of construction firms and suppliers stiffed by Mr. Trump. He then served as a member of the so-called Group of Seven leading the committee’s negotiations that resulted in the contractors getting partial payments.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Atlantic Plate Glass lost about $450,000 in the settlement, said Mr. Rosenberg, adding that his personal finances took a hit because of his minority stockholder stake in the firm, and that the company struggled but overcame the loss.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Others fared worse, he said, including smaller businesses that didn’t survive.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n “From my experience, he is definitely ego-driven, disingenuous and will say whatever he has to say at the time,” Mr. Rosenberg, 73, said of the billionaire businessman. “Trump says whatever is on his mind at the time that will get him off the hook.”\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Mr. Trump questioned Mr. Rosenberg’s motives for telling his story now. He said he didn’t remember Mr. Rosenberg, but he remembered the glass job at the Taj Mahal cost a total of about $10 million.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n “To the best of my knowledge, I never even met him. Just another publicity-seeker,” Mr. Trump said in an email to The Washington Times.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Newspaper reports from the time corroborate the version of events related by Mr. Rosenberg, who said he was registered as an independent and voted for President Obama in 2012.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Mr. Rosenberg, who is retired and lives near Atlantic City, said he wasn’t motivated by partisanship or a desire to boost another presidential candidate, although he vowed that he would never vote for Mr. Trump.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Still, his misgivings about Mr. Trump echo criticism leveled by the front-runner’s rivals and GOP leaders desperate to derail his candidacy.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n At the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, Republican presidential contender Sen. Ted Cruz warned the crowd of conservative activists that Mr. Trump would “stick it to ya” if he makes it to the White House.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Back in the summer of 1990, Mr. Trump was hustling to keep the Taj Mahal afloat and juggling roughly $3 billion in debt to banks and junk bond holders.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n His empire of casinos, Trump Airline and real estate holdings were not generating cash fast enough to pay debts and support his extravagant lifestyle. He was spending nearly $1 million per week on his homes, yacht, Boeing 727 and other personal expenses, according to news reports.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n He eliminated the equivalent of 1,000 jobs at the Taj Mahal and bargained with Mr. Rosenberg and other contractors to pay them a fraction of what they were owed.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n All these years later, Mr. Rosenberg still fumes about his dealings with Mr. Trump, first when they negotiated the price for the job and then later when forced to haggle over getting paid.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n “The bottom line is negotiations are when you start a job and you come up with a price, and they want to cut you down, not at the end of the job,” he said. “That’s not negotiations. You’re under duress. What are you going to do? You take what you can get. And that’s what happened.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n “His art of the deal is getting to the point where you have no choice but to do what he says,” said Mr. Rosenberg, referring to Mr. Trump’s best-selling business book “The Art of the Deal.”\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n In addition to the partial payment, the agreement gave the contractors and suppliers the right of first refusal for future jobs at the Taj Mahal. But Mr. Rosenberg said he never worked for Mr. Trump again for fear of another shakedown.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n The deal with the construction firms and suppliers allowed Mr. Trump’s casino venture to avoid an involuntary bankruptcy lawsuit. But Mr. Trump filed for bankruptcy about six months later, the first of his four bankruptcies for his hotels and casinos.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Mr. Trump and the bondholders emerged from the Taj Mahal bankruptcy relatively unscathed.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n By 1996 the publicly traded Trump Hotel and Casino Resorts bought the Taj Mahal, paying the bondholders $40.5 million for their half of the equity, while Mr. Trump pocketed $40.5 million in THCR stock for his half.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n When challenged about his record of repeated bankruptcy filings for his businesses, Mr. Trump has defended himself by saying he has “taken advantage of the laws of this country.”\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Mr. Rosenberg has a different view.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n “If ethics and morality have nothing to do with business, then he’s a phenomenal businessman,” he said.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    The story of Jesus’s entrance into Jerusalem, the Last Supper, and his Betrayal, Crucifixion, and Resurrection, as interpreted by leading Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.  Jerusalem -- big city! Biggest city. You know, Jerusalem, it used to be great. Now it’s just terrible! Terrible! We gotta get great biblical cities again. Gotta get great. So Jesus — really nice guy. Too nice. Way too nice. People are too nice now. That’s why we’re losing. Losing all the time. So Jesus, he’s going into Jerusalem. So he asks a disciple to get a … a donkey. And that’s why he’s a loser! That’s why Jesus Christ is a loser. Why are people trying to act like this loser on a donkey? When Donald Trump goes into a city, he’s getting the best. The absolute best. A Trump horse. A Trump stallion. You know they measure horses in hands? Well, they measure Trump horses in Trump hands. The biggest hands. So the people, the people of Jerusalem, they just love Jesus. Love him! Love that guy! They’re all, “Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!” Then the ESTABLISHMENT, and they’re not funding me, by the way, I am totally, completely self-funded, they TELL Jesus, “Hey, you gotta stop these people!” And Jesus is like, “No way!” I know what that’s like, because we have these thugs at my events, and then my people will punch them in the face, and the ESTABLISHMENT tells me, “Hey, you gotta stop people from being violent at your campaign events.” I’m pretty similar to Jesus. But, you know, I’ve been way more successful. Way more. I’m not a loser. Jesus, I don’t know about that guy. I just don’t understand it. So he’s the king, right? He’s the king. Son of God. The big God. But he knows, he knows that something is about to happen! Those lyin’ Pharisees and their thugs are just -- they’re sniffing around. You know if I’m in that situation, I am spilling the beans on them! And their wives. Got a lot on those wives. Going after those wives. But Jesus, he doesn’t do anything! Doesn’t do a thing. Little Jesus! Too scared to go after the big guys. That’s why, like I said, he’s not a winner. I’m a winner. We’re going to make America great again, guys. And not by acting like this loser Jesus. So Jesus, he’s got this big holiday to celebrate. Big holiday. Not the biggest. Not a Trump holiday. But it’s Passover, there’s some food. But Jesus, he’s washing feet! Washing the feet of his disciples. He knows one of them, one of them is going to betray him! Gonna just lie and lie, and help the ESTABLISHMENT, and Jesus isn’t doing anything! That’s why we’re not winning. When we’re trying to be like LITTLE JESUS with his LOSER ATTITUDE, we’re not winning. So he washes all of their disgusting feet. Disgusting. It’s just terrible. And then Peter, Peter is going to deny Jesus. Do it three whole times! And Jesus knows it, and he doesn’t do anything about it. I just can’t believe this. Get a load of this Jesus guy. Telling people he loves them. Telling people to love one another as he loves them. Saying you gotta lay your life down for your friends. Love, love, love. What a loser. So Jesus, he’s a loser, and he’s a rule breaker. You know what I say about rule breakers: You gotta punish them. We’re not punishing people anymore. That’s our problem. We’re too nice. We gotta make America great again, and we gotta punish people. Punish everyone! So Jesus, he’s praying. Praying in this garden. It’s not a nice garden. Not a nice one at all. And then Judas, he comes in, with these soldiers and priests, and Jesus, he knows what’s going on. But he doesn’t do anything! Little Jesus, the son of God, and he’s not doing anything! Simon Peter pulls out his sword and cuts off a guy’s ear, but Little Jesus, he’s like, “Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?” Jesus is just going to let this happen. I can’t believe it. Can’t believe it! The soldiers and priests, they take him away. They take him to two high priests, real big guys, real important, and Jesus, he says he’s been open, he doesn’t have any secrets. Talking like that, to the high priests! That’s why we’re not great anymore, that’s why we’re losing all the time. No respect for authority. So they take him to Pontius Pilate, and Pilate’s asking Jesus these questions, and Jesus says that the reason he was born was to testify to the truth. He won’t say he’s the king of the Jews. Won’t say it. Not a leader. Not a real leader. Little Jesus. And then Pilate’s asking the Jews around the palace if they want Jesus released. And they say that they want Barabbas. Barabbas, now that’s a leader. Real man of the people. Real man. Big man. Big hands. And then, they take Jesus, and they really beat the crap out of him. Whips and the whole deal. Real punishment. We gotta get back to that. Then they take him, and they put a crown of thorns on him, and they show him to the people around there, and they say they want him crucified. You gotta listen to the people. We’re just not doing that right now. No one listens to the little guy who wants Jesus Christ crucified. I will. I’ll crucify whoever you want. And Jesus, he doesn’t say anything! Not a leader. Just says that Pilate wouldn’t have power over him if he hadn’t been granted that power from above. Little Jesus. Always losing, just giving himself away. So they take Jesus, and they nail him to a cross on Golgotha. Nail him right on it. He’s just on this cross. Not doing anything about it. Talks to his mother, talks to a disciple, but doesn’t fight back. Not a leader. Can’t believe it. The son of God, nailed to a cross, not punching anyone or doing anything at all. And he gives up his spirit. Just gives up. So Jesus, he’s dead now. Real dead. Joseph of Arimathea, wealthy guy, small-business owner. We gotta do more for the Josephs of Arimathea in this country. Good people. So anyway, Joseph, he’s a follower of Jesus. So he asks for Jesus’s body, and he and this guy, Nicodemus, they prepare Jesus’s body, and they bury it in a tomb. Not a nice tomb. Not a big tomb. I’m gonna have a huge tomb. So Jesus, he’s lying in this tomb. He’s dead. But then, Mary Magdalene, not an attractive woman, not smart, blood coming out of her whatever, not a good lady, she’s here. And it’s a couple of days later. And the stone in front of the tomb, it’s gone. She goes back and tells everyone, and they all come, and they see that the tomb is empty. But it’s been a few days. So who knows what happened. But then Jesus, he’s back. He took three whole days to come back. Three days! That’s not a leader. Should have been putting those Romans and priests on stretchers. Lazy. Not a real leader. Waiting three whole days to come back from the dead. That’s why we’re losing in this country. Too many people trying to be like this loser Jesus Christ. Not enough people being like me, being a leader with big hands and a lot of big ideas and a whole lot of hate. Not enough hate in this country. Make America more hateful. That’s what we gotta do. Not like Jesus. Jesus was a loser. Real loser. Little Jesus. Didn’t even have a hot wife or anything. Not one hot piece of ass. Just a lot of talk about love. Sad! The Word of the Lord.    The reports spread rapidly last week across Christian media: Evangelical icon Billy Graham had prophesied over Donald Trump. The story came from charismatic televangelist Paula White, who told a Florida Trump rally about her close friendship with the magnate and how he’d asked her for a Bible signed by Graham, one of the most\\xa0popular American spiritual leaders of the last century. It was for Trump’s 60th birthday, White told the crowd, and she got it in 2005.  “For his 60th, Billy Graham wrote a prophetic word to Mr. Donald Trump. Can you hear me? I’m saying [Trump] loves God,” she said to cheers in a video posted on Charisma News, a site for charismatic Christians. Describing Trump, she said: “I don’t believe anything is coincidence. I believe there is such a thing as destiny and God will raise up such a main for such a time as this.” Graham’s office, however, denies there was anything but a basic good wish in the Bible. “In 2005, Paula White reached out to Mr. Graham asking him to sign a Bible for Donald Trump as a gift from her for his 60th birthday,” the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association told The Post on Monday. “A Bible was sent to Ms. White with the inscription: ‘To Donald Trump, God Bless you always. Billy Graham.’ We have no record of a prophetic word from Billy Graham to Donald Trump.” The association also said Trump and his wife attended a party in November 2014 for Graham’s 95th birthday, and “at this time another Bible was mailed to Mr. Trump. The letter with the Bible was a simple message of encouragement similar to what a number of guests received.” The idea that Graham had “prophesied” about Trump may mean different things. To some Christians it might simply mean an uplifting message, but for most charismatic Christians – to whom White appeals – it means that such a message came from God. White’s comments were made March 5 to about 10,000 people in Orlando, Fla., according to the Christian Post, which first reported on the Graham story. Billy Graham is 97 and in ill health and doesn’t appear regularly in public. His son, evangelist\\xa0Franklin Graham, however, told Fox Business last week that he is not endorsing anyone this year. “I have no hope in the Republican Party and I don’t have any hope in the Democratic Party,” he said. “I’m staying out of the race. The politicians have messed this country up big time. I’m unaffiliated [and] I’m independent. I’m just fed up with the politicians. I think the only hope for this country is God.” In 2011, Franklin Graham sounded somewhat open to Trump. “When I first heard about him entering, I thought it was a joke. The more I listen to him, the more I say: ‘Maybe he’s right.’ … Certainly, America needs somebody like a Donald Trump who’s got business experience to get us out of the mess that Republicans and Democrats alike have gotten us into,” he told Christianity Today in 2011.\\xa0“No question, the guy’s got a lot of baggage. He owns casinos. He’s had multiple marriages. I did not endorse him.” The Christian Post, a major evangelical publication, ran an editorial last month encouraging its readers “to back away from Donald Trump.” “Trump claims to be a Christian, yet says he has never asked for forgiveness. Trump is a misogynist and philanderer. He demeans women and minorities. His preferred forms of communication are insults, obscenities and untruths. While Christians have been guilty of all of these, we, unlike Trump, acknowledge our sins, ask for forgiveness and seek restitution with the aid of the Holy Spirit and our community of believers,” the editorial said. Trump’s candidacy has revealed dramatic divisions among evangelical Christians. White is among a group of high-profile televangelists who were investigated for years by U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley\\xa0(R-Iowa), who raised questions about church spending on things like luxury homes and private planes. Several of the ministries would not provide full information to Grassley, according to the Associated Press, including White’s. His probe ended in 2011 with no penalties and no conclusions about whether the ministries broke the law, the AP reported. White is one of the country’s most high-profile female Pentecostal pastors and preaches a controversial but booming form of Christianity called prosperity gospel. Many conservative Christians condemn the hugely popular gospel, which teaches that God rewards the faithful with material wealth.  Want more stories about faith?

According to a 1990 Vanity Fair interview, Ivana Trump once told her lawyer Michael Kennedy that her husband, real-estate mogul Donald Trump, now a leading Republican presidential candidate, kept a book of Hitler\\'s speeches near his bed. \"Last April, perhaps in a surge of Czech nationalism, Ivana Trump told her lawyer Michael Kennedy that from time to time her husband reads a book of Hitler\\'s collected speeches, My New Order, which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed ... Hitler\\'s speeches, from his earliest days up through the Phony War of 1939, reveal his extraordinary ability as a master propagandist,\" Marie Brenner wrote. Hitler was one of history\\'s most prolific orators, building a genocidal Nazi regime with speeches that bewitched audiences. \"He learned how to become a charismatic speaker, and people, for whatever reason, became enamored with him,\" Professor Bruce Loebs, who has taught a class called the Rhetoric of Hitler and Churchill for the past 46 years at Idaho State University, told Business Insider earlier this year. \"People were most willing to follow him, because he seemed to have the right answers in a time of enormous economic upheaval.\"    Amazon  When Brenner asked Trump about how he came to possess Hitler\\'s speeches, \"Trump hesitated\" and then said, \"Who told you that?\" \"I don\\'t remember,\" Brenner reportedly replied. Trump then recalled, \"Actually, it was my friend Marty Davis from Paramount who gave me a copy of \\'Mein Kampf,\\' and he\\'s a Jew.\" Brenner added that Davis did acknowledge that he gave Trump a book about Hitler. \"But it was \\'My New Order,\\' Hitler\\'s speeches, not \\'Mein Kampf,\\'\" Davis reportedly said. \"I thought he would find it interesting. I am his friend, but I\\'m not Jewish.\" After Trump and Brenner changed topics, Trump returned to the subject and reportedly said, \"If, I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them.\" In the Vanity Fair article, Ivana Trump told a friend that her husband\\'s cousin, John Walter \"clicks his heels and says, \\'Heil Hitler,\" when visiting Trump\\'s office. Here\\'s the entire Vanity Fair interview.  \\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president and self-described “king of debt,” offered a glimpse into his deal-making playbook Wednesday morning as he defended himself from Hillary Clinton’s attacks.\\n“I’m the king of debt. I’m great with debt. Nobody knows debt better than me,” Trump told Norah O’Donnell in an interview that aired on “CBS This Morning.” “I’ve made a fortune by using debt, and if things don’t work out I renegotiate the debt. I mean, that’s a smart thing, not a stupid thing.”\\n“How do you renegotiate the debt?” O’Donnell followed up.\\n\\n\\n“You go back and you say, hey guess what, the economy crashed,” Trump replied. “I’m going to give you back half.”\\nClinton blasted Trump’s economic views in a speech on Tuesday, accusing him of gambling with the full faith and credit of the United States by flirting with a default on the debt.\\n“That could cause an economic catastrophe, and it would break 225 years of ironclad trust that the American economy has with Americans and with the rest of the world,” Clinton said. “Alexander Hamilton would be rolling in his grave. You see, we pay our debts.”\\nThe real estate mogul countered that while he’s benefited from taking on debt in his business dealings, the U.S. is “sitting on a time bomb” with its national debt. President Barack Obama has grown the debt, Trump said, and Clinton “doesn’t have a clue” when it comes to debt reduction.\\nIn a different interview Wednesday morning on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” Trump defended his use of bankruptcy laws in business dealings. The GOP nominee, who has been through four corporate bankruptcies, said he has “used brilliantly the laws of this country” in the business world, but never in his personal life. He said his history of bankruptcies is not unique within the business community.\\n“I’m running a business, you’ve got to understand. I’m running a business,” Trump said when asked if those bankruptcies had hurt average Americans. “I’m running a business for myself, for my company, for my employees and for my family.”\\nTrump, presented by O’Donnell with reports from independent economists who say his proposals would balloon the national debt by $30 trillion, also said his plans would reverse the flow of corporations and jobs leaving the United States. He said he would turn the U.S. into an attractive destination for businesses by lowering tax rates.\\n“Companies now are leaving the United States, corporate inversion, they’re leaving the United States. We have almost five trillion dollars sitting out there, they can’t get the money back,” he said. “They can’t bring it in because there’s no mechanism to bring it back in and the tax is so high. I’m going to bring tremendous amount of money, tremendous amounts of jobs, tremendous amounts of companies.”\\n\\n\\n\\n  Ever wonder what Donald Trump is like? No, really like? Say, at home? Anthony Senecal, Trump’s longtime butler at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., knows better than almost anyone else. “You can always tell when the king is here,” Senecal told the New York Times for a profile (“A King in His Castle: How Donald Trump Lives”) that was published Tuesday.        White hat: Good mood. Red hat: Watch out! (Photos: Getty)  The 74-year-old Senecal, who’s worked at the 118-room estate for nearly 60 years, revealed some little-known quirks about the Republican frontrunner. Among them: • Trump likes his steak well done — cooked through so thoroughly it “rock[s] on the plate.” • “Mr. Trump insists — despite the hair salon on the premises — on doing his own hair.” • Senecal once hired a bugler to play “Hail to the Chief” as Trump stepped out of his limousine after receiving “an urgent warning from Mr. Trump’s soon-to-land plane that the mogul was in a sour mood.” • Mar-a-Lago staffers have figured out how to tell if Trump is in one of those sour moods — by observing the color of his hat: “If the cap was white, the staff noticed, the boss was in a good mood. If it was red, it was best to stay away.” • When he is in a good mood, Trump sometimes peels “$100 bills from a wad in his pocket to give to the groundskeepers.”  • “Mr. Trump rarely appears in bathing trunks, for example, and does not like to swim.”   • After the real estate mogul bought the estate in 1985, he turned the library into a bar and hung a painting of himself, in tennis whites, on the wall. “I’ve been in other homes in Palm Beach — same exact painting,” Senecal said. “Just a different head.”  • Senecal tried to retire in 2009, but Trump wouldn’t have it, elevating him to “a kind of unofficial historian” at Mar-a-Lago instead:    “Tony, to retire is to expire,” Mr. Trump told him. “I’ll see you next season.”    • And while Trump is “abundantly proud of his ability to drive a golf ball,” Senecal would sometimes lie to his boss when asked how far his ball went:    “Tony, how far is that?” Mr. Trump would ask. “It’s like 275 yards,” Mr. Senecal would respond, though he said the actual distance was 225 yards.

Republicans who tolerated years of insults against the Democratic president helped create the environment in which Trump could take over the party, Obama told a crowd in Columbus, Ohio. “The people who knew better didn’t say anything,” Obama said. “They didn’t say ... we can’t allow our politics to descend into the gutter. They stood by while this happened.” Obama echoed the words of First Lady Michelle Obama, who said at a campaign event for Democrat Hillary Clinton earlier Thursday that Trump’s words on a 2005 audio tape, in which he brags about sexually assaulting women, had “shaken me to my core.” Dozens of Republicans have unendorsed or stepped away from Trump since the recording came to light. Voters shouldn’t give those Republicans “points,” Obama told the crowd at the annual “state dinner” of the Ohio Democratic Party. He specifically called out Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman, who is fighting off a challenge from former Democratic governor Ted Strickland. Obama repeatedly pointed to Portman as one of those Republicans who stood by while members of the party questioned Obama’s citizenship and religion, and opposed almost everything he tried to achieve. “They don’t get credit for, at the very last minute, when finally the guy that they nominated … is caught on tape saying things that no decent person would even think, much less say, much less brag about.… You can’t wait until that finally happens and then say, ‘That’s too much,’” Obama said.    Melania Trump demands partial retraction of article by one of her husband’s accusers  By\\xa0Seema Mehta   Melania Trump, the wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, demanded Thursday that People magazine retract a portion of an article that alleged he made an unwanted advance on the author while she visited the Trumps’ Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida to write about the couple’s first wedding anniversary. But the letter does not mention the most provocative parts of the article – that as Melania Trump, then pregnant, went upstairs to change, Donald Trump guided writer Natasha Stoynoff into a room, closed the door behind them, pushed her against a wall and shoved his tongue down her throat. Stoynoff, in an article published on People’s website Wednesday night, wrote that she tried to “unpin” herself, but that Donald Trump only stopped when a butler interrupted them to say that his wife was returning. Melania Trump is demanding a retraction and apology about a portion of the article where Stoynoff recounts running into the former model months later in front of Trump Tower in New York. Stoynoff wrote that Melania Trump asked why the couple no longer saw the author and gave her a hug. By then, Melania Trump had given birth to a boy, Barron, and Stoynoff wrote that she affectionately squeezed the boy’s foot. Trump’s attorney says all of this is false. “The true facts are these: Mrs. Trump did not encounter Ms. Stoynoff on the street, nor have any conversation with her. The two are not friends and were never friends or even friendly. At the time in question, Mrs. Trump would not have even recognized Ms. Stoynoff if they had encountered one another on the street,” wrote attorney Charles J. Harder. The letter says if People magazine does not make a retraction and apology within 24 hours, Trump would consider legal action against the magazine. Marnie Perez, a spokeswoman for People, confirmed the magazine had received Trump’s letter and said People stands by the story. The retraction demand comes as Donald Trump battles allegations from multiple women that he touched their bodies and kissed them against their will. The women, including Stoynoff, said they decided to speak out about their years-old experiences because the GOP presidential nominee dismissed a recording of him speaking crassly about women as “locker room talk.”  Trump has responded by dismissing all the allegations as false concoctions and threatening to sue the New York Times. He also spoke out against Stoynoff on the campaign trail on Thursday, saying that the writer wrote a beautiful “love story” about the couple and questioned why she did not include the groping allegation in her piece, which he said would have made it “one of the biggest stories of the year.” Trump, speaking to supporters in West Palm Beach, Fla., then alluded to the writer’s looks.  “Take a look at her. Take a look at her words. You tell me what you think,” Trump said. “I don’t think so.”    Trump, reeling from groping allegations, makes pitch to young people  By\\xa0Kurtis Lee      (Evan Vucci / Associated Press)    Reeling from accusations that he groped women, a subdued Donald Trump told a crowd of young people in Ohio on Thursday that the media was working with his opponent to unfairly discredit him. “The Clintons and the corporate media are one in the same,” Trump told hundreds of millennials at an invitation-only event in Columbus. “They collaborate and conspire together.” He alluded to recently published emails by WikiLeaks that show communications earlier this year between Donna Brazile, then-Democratic National Committee vice chairwoman and CNN contributor, and the Clinton campaign about questions posed to candidates at a CNN town hall event in March. “This Washington establishment will stop at nothing to stop all of us,” Trump said. In national polls, young voters widely offer unfavorable opinions of both candidates. Trump called for college affordability and said he would simplify student loan programs to make it easier for students to pay back college debt. “A vote for me is a vote for you,” he said. Earlier on Thursday while in Florida, a much more animated Trump lashed out at the women stepping forward to tell their stories about being kissed and touched by him against their will. A writer for People magazine said Trump forced himself on her when she was in Florida conducting an interview in 2005 at his Mar-A-Lago estate. Trump appeared to allude to the writer’s looks in his speech. “Take a look at her,” Trump said. “Take a look at her words. You tell me what you think. I don’t think so.”    Donald Trump once told 14-year-old girls, ‘In a couple of years, I’ll be dating you’  By\\xa0Seema Mehta   Donald Trump appears to have a pattern of trying to charm young girls with a line about dating him.  In a December 1992 wire brief in the Chicago Tribune, Trump is described as having spotted a youth choir singing Christmas carols at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. He asked two girls how old they were. When they said they were 14, Trump, then 46, replied, “Wow! Just think — in a couple of years, I’ll be dating you.” On Wednesday, CBS News reported a similar scenario involving a 10-year-old girl around the same time, when Trump was between his first and second marriages. In footage from the archives of CBS-owned “Entertainment Tonight,” Trump asks the child if she is planning to ride the escalator at Trump Tower. After she says yes, Trump turns to cameras taping a Christmas special for the show and says, “I am going to be dating her in 10 years. Can you believe it?” In both instances, the line appears to be somewhat in jest, though the girls’ ages and recent accusations of sex assault against Trump call that into question. The Trump campaign did not immediately return a request for comment. The revelations come as Trump is being buffeted by allegations by multiple women that he groped and kissed them against their will. The women said they decided to come forth publicly after Trump dismissed a recording of him speaking crassly about women as “locker room talk” rather than an indication of sexually aggressive behavior. Trump has vehemently denied the allegations made by the women.    Hillary Clinton’s advice for coping with a negative campaign: Watch cat GIFs  By\\xa0Michael A. Memoli      (Andrew Harnik / Associated Press)    Don’t boo, GIF! That’s Hillary Clinton’s digitally inspired take on one of President Obama’s favorite edicts to supporters when they jeer their political opponents -- “Don’t boo, vote!” Speaking at a fundraiser in San Francisco on Thursday, the Democratic presidential nominee reflected on the starkly negative turn of the campaign’s final month. “It makes you want to turn off the news. It makes you want to unplug the Internet or just look at cat GIFs,” she said. “Believe me, I get it. In the last few weeks I’ve watched a lot of cats do a lot of weird and interesting things.” But Clinton urged supporters not to succumb to the temptation to tune out the campaign and stay away from the polls on election day. “We have a job to do, and it’ll be good for people and for cats,” she said. “We need to demonstrate that we have a hopeful, positive, unifying vision for our country in the face of all this ugly [rhetoric].” Clinton made no specific reference to new allegations that GOP nominee Donald Trump inappropriately touched women against their will. But the “whole world has heard Trump brag about how he mistreats women,” she said.  “The disturbing stories just keep coming, but it’s more than just the way he degrades women, as horrible as that is,” she added. “He has attacked immigrants, African Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and our military, which he’s called a disaster. There’s hardly any part of America that he’s not targeted.” For those needing a break from the news, here’s a cat GIF to get you started:    In leaked emails, top advisor asks how Tom Steyer could help Hillary Clinton’s campaign  By\\xa0Kurtis Lee   A team of advisors to Hillary Clinton debated how billionaire California environmentalist Tom Steyer could help the campaign without violating campaign finance laws, according to newly leaked emails.  The exchange is part of a new batch of emails from the private account of Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta, obtained and posted on Thursday by WikiLeaks. Steyer, who spent more than $74 million on congressional and gubernatorial campaigns in 2014, oversees the political action group NextGen Climate Action Committee.  “Assume he can’t host an event with her or one of us,” wrote Podesta in an April 2015 email. “Correct?” Campaign finance rules prohibit coordination between campaigns and outside groups that can spend unlimited sums in support of a candidate.  “Not easily. If important to do so, let me know and we can come up with our best options (which may not be good),” wrote Marc Elias, a lawyer at the firm Perkins Coie, which serves as the campaign’s general counsel. Dennis Cheng, Clinton’s national finance director, suggested Steyer host an event for Clinton, then focus on his group.  In May 2015, Steyer did host a fundraiser in San Francisco for Clinton, separate from NextGen Climate Action. Steyer’s group has spent millions on ads in opposition to Donald Trump. Many of the ads, in both Spanish and English, urge young people to get out and vote.  The San Francisco Democrat is considered by many to be a potential California gubernatorial candidate in 2018.    Trump denies groping allegations, lashes out at media  By\\xa0Seema Mehta      (Evan Vucci / Associated Press)    Donald Trump angrily denied allegations by several women of sexual misconduct and lashed out against the media as an arm of Hillary Clinton’s campaign hell-bent on preventing him from winning the White House. “These vicious claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false,” the Republican nominee told a rally in West Palm Beach, Fla. “These claims are all fabricated. They’re pure fiction and they’re outright lies. These events never happened.” Trump said the allegations that he kissed and groped women without their consent, emerging four weeks before the election, are evidence that the political establishment and special interests are frightened by Trump’s campaign and his supporters. “Our campaign represents a true existential threat like they haven’t seen before,” Trump said. “This is not simply another four-year election. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization.” Trump response came after multiple women complained in news accounts about Trump touching their bodies and kissing them against their will.   The women said they decided to speak out, years after the alleged misconduct, because Trump had dismissed a recording of him making crude comments about women as “locker room talk” rather than sexually aggressive behavior. Trump had special ire for the New York Times, which published a page one story Thursday about two women who allege that Trump made unwanted advances years ago. One said Trump had groped her on an airplane and the other said Trump had forcibly kissed her at Trump Tower. In an exchange of letters Thursday, the newspaper’s lawyer rejected a demand from Trump’s lawyers to retract the article and to apologize. Trump also mocked an article published Wednesday night by a former People magazine writer who wrote that Trump mauled her when she visited his Mar-A-Lago club in Florida to write a story about the first anniversary of Trump’s marriage to Melania, his third wife. Trump said the writer wrote a “beautiful” story about the couple, and questioned why she did not include the groping allegation in her piece, which he said would have made it “one of the biggest stories of the year.” Trump then appeared to allude to the writer’s looks. “Take a look at her. Take a look at her words. You tell me what you think,” Trump said. “I don’t think so.” Trump said the allegations had been personally painful and he tried to use them to rally his supporters to go to the polls. “The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you,” he said.    New York Times rejects Donald Trump’s demand for a retraction  By\\xa0Kurtis Lee   An attorney for the New York Times has rejected a demand from a law firm representing Donald Trump to remove and retract a story about women who claimed the Republican presidential nominee had engaged in sexual misconduct with them. Trump’s attorneys claimed the newspaper committed libel when it published a report Wednesday that quoted two women who said that Trump had groped them, and Trump publicly vowed to sue the newspaper. “You ask that we ‘remove it from [our] website, and issue a full and immediate retraction and apology,’ ” David E. McCraw, the newspaper’s lawyer, responded Thursday. “We decline to do so.” McCraw all but dared Trump to sue the paper, writing that the newspaper welcomes “the opportunity to have a court set him straight” about libel law. McCraw denied that the paper had committed libel, noting that “the essence of a libel claim, of course, is the protection of one’s reputation.” “Mr. Trump has bragged about his non-consensual sexual touching of women” and he has “acquiesced to a radio host’s request to discuss Mr. Trump’s own daughter as a ‘piece of ass,’ ” he wrote, alluding to a 2005 tape of Trump making lewd comments about women and his past appearances on the “Howard Stern Show,” in which he has talked about his daughter Ivanka.  Moreover, McCraw wrote that the two women quoted in the front-page article “spoke out on an issue of national importance” because of the presidential election. Jessica Leeds, 74, told the newspaper that Trump had grabbed her breasts and tried to slip his hand up her skirt as they sat in the first-class cabin of a plane more than three decades ago. “He was like an octopus,” Leeds told the paper. “His hands were everywhere.” Rachel Crooks told the Times that Trump abruptly kissed her on the mouth when she introduced herself to him in front of an elevator in 2005 while she was working as a 22-year-old secretary in Trump Tower in New York. In a rally in West Palm Beach, Fla., Trump angrily denied the women’s claims and blamed his rival, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, for the story. “These vicious claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false,” Trump said. “And the Clintons know it, and they know it very well. These claims are all fabricated. They’re pure fiction, and they’re outright lies.”    Michelle Obama delivers emotional rebuke of Trump  By\\xa0Evan Halper   First Lady Michelle Obama delivered a powerful rebuke of Donald Trump and his behavior toward women during one of the most emotional speeches of the presidential campaign on Thursday. “This is not normal,” Obama said in the New Hampshire address. “This is not politics as usual. This is disgraceful. This is intolerable.” Obama framed the election as a crucial moment for the history of women — not just because voters have the opportunity to elect their first female president, but because they can send a message that the country no longer tolerates the attitudes toward women that Trump represents. She said that tolerating another minute of Trump’s behavior, including the lewd remarks caught on a hot mic and the allegations several women are now making that he groped and kissed them against their will, is hurting women and sending a dangerous message to America’s youth.   Read More     Kaine: How did Trump not see this coming?  By\\xa0Evan Halper   Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine said he is not surprised to see multiple women stepping forward to accuse Trump of groping and kissing them against their will. During an interview on ABC’s “The View,” Kaine said what surprises him is that Trump didn’t see it coming. “I was surprised onstage Sunday night when he said, ‘I just said that, I never did it,’ ” Kaine said, referring to Trump’s insistence during the presidential debate that his bragging about making unwanted sexual advances on a recently disclosed video was just “locker room talk.” “I felt like, OK, how many days is it going to be until folks are coming out and saying, ‘No that’s exactly the way he treated me,’ and now we are seeing that happen,” Kaine said. He added that he is “not surprised, but it is shocking.” Kaine predicted voters are unlikely to be impressed by the Trump campaign’s effort to paint Bill and Hillary Clinton as even worse victimizers of women, mostly by putting the spotlight on Bill Clinton’s alleged bad behavior. “Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are the two on the ballot,” Kaine said. “That is the relevant comparison. After Donald lost the first debate, he said, ‘Now I’ve got to make the Clintons’ marriage an issue.’ It’s not an issue for the voters.”    These astrologists vow to predict who the next president will be  By\\xa0Anh Do      (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times)    Are the celestial bodies aligned in favor of Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump? The answer may emerge during a meeting this week of astrologists from around the globe, who are vowing to study charts and planetary positions to predict who will be the next U.S. president.  About 500 members of the International Society for Astrological Research will gather in Costa Mesa from Thursday to Sunday for a symposium tackling a wide variety of topics, including the financial markets, relationships and roller-coaster politics.

Oh he knew what Aleppo was, he just didn’t copy on the context. He thought it was an acronym.  — Bill Weld, vice presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party, speaking to MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” about Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson’s blunders on foreign policy questions    Trump campaign strains to respond to his accusers  By\\xa0Evan Halper   Donald Trump’s campaign is reeling from the fallout of new allegations by women that he groped and kissed them without consent. The campaign has responded by saying the GOP presidential candidate is the victim, calling the accounts false and defamatory, and threatening to file lawsuits.  But the volume of incidents -- which emerged separately Wednesday evening in the New York Times, People magazine and the Palm Beach Post -- appear to be giving Trump surrogates pause. By 8 a.m. on the East Coast, not a single elected official appeared on CNN to defend Trump. North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, who had been scheduled, canceled his appearance. The task of defending Trump was left mostly to his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who is on CNN’s payroll. “He said unequivocally these things didn’t happen,” Lewandowski said. “What I do find very interesting is the timing of this. ... He’s been running for president for two years now. And they wait until 25 days before an election.” Lewandowski called the timing of the reports “a little egregious,” as he struggled to pursue the Trump campaign talking point that it is the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who have victimized women. “I never saw this,” said Lewandowski, who was a longtime Trump employee before the businessman announced his bid for the presidency. “He was the least sexist boss I ever had.” On Fox, former presidential candidate Ben Carson, a staunch Trump supporter, strained to make the case that the multiple reports of unwanted sexual advances were a distraction ginned up by the mainstream media. “Look, if you’re willing to come out and say something, we’ll give you fame, we will give you whatever you need,” Carson said.    Trump bailing on Virginia?  By\\xa0Evan Halper   The electoral map for Donald Trump continues to shrink. The Republican presidential candidate’s vows to make a big push in Virginia have faded amid news reports that his campaign is shifting resources out of the battleground state. The move reflects not just the recent reports of Trump’s inappropriate behavior with women, but the demographic realities of the state. The population explosion in Virginia’s northern suburbs have, politically at least, turned the once solidly GOP Southern stronghold into a mid-Atlantic swing state that leans Democratic. At the same time, Trump is also flailing in Pennsylvania. A new Bloomberg poll has Trump 9 points down in that battleground. Any inroads Trump may have made in the economically struggling western part of the state are overshadowed by his tepid support among the moderate voters in the Philadelphia suburbs, who are crucial to victory in Pennsylvania.    Trump attorneys demand New York Times retract story on assault allegations  By\\xa0Seema Mehta      Donald Trump campaigns Wednesday in Lakeland, Fla.  (Evan Vucci / Associated Press)    Multiple women recounted being kissed and groped by Donald Trump without their consent in reports published Wednesday, saying they came forward because the GOP presidential nominee dismissed his lewd comments caught on tape as “locker room talk,” not actual sexual aggression. Trump, already reeling from the fallout of the 2005 recording that emerged Friday, denied the reports. His attorneys demanded a retraction from the New York Times, saying the paper’s article about two women’s claims is “reckless, defamatory and constitutes libel per se.” If the paper does not retract the article and remove it from its website, says the letter to Dean Baquet, the paper’s executive editor, Trump will “pursue all available actions and remedies.” Late Wednesday, People magazine also published an account from one of its former writers who described being attacked by the GOP nominee when she went to Mar-a-Lago to interview Trump and his wife, Melania, for a story about their first wedding anniversary.

Four years ago, Velasquez knocked on doors for Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, but he can’t abide Donald Trump and his showman’s style of campaigning. “I’ve never taken him seriously,” said Velasquez, the son of Honduran immigrants, who takes politics and political involvement very seriously.  Read More          PELLA, Iowa /ANKENY, Iowa (Reuters) - U.S. Republican front-runner Donald Trump expressed confidence on Saturday that he could push back attempts by his rivals to knock him off his top perch, saying he could stand on New York’s Fifth Avenue “and shoot somebody,” and still not lose voters. Nine days from the first nominating contest in Iowa, however, it was Republican rival Marco Rubio who won the endorsement Saturday from the Des Moines Register, the state’s biggest and most influential newspaper. On the Democratic side, the Register picked Hillary Clinton. The endorsements were big developments for both Rubio and Clinton. Rubio, a Florida senator, has been running third behind Trump and Texas Senator Ted Cruz in Iowa, while Clinton has struggled to fend off a challenge to the Democratic nomination from Bernie Sanders. Trump and Cruz, Trump’s chief obstacle to a victory in Iowa, held competing rallies across the state while in New Hampshire, other candidates battled for votes in that state’s Feb. 9 first-in-the-nation primary for the Nov. 8 election. Trump, the New York billionaire and former reality TV star who has been virtually impervious to attacks from his opponents, pushed the limits of his political rhetoric again in Sioux Center, Iowa. “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose any voters,” he said. Trump has been a difficult target for criticism from his rivals because not all of his supporters are conservatives and many are most interested in his projection of strength, not where he stands on a particular issue. The latest Reuters-Ipsos tracking poll had Trump pulling in 40.6 percent support of Republican voters nationally. A CNN/ORC poll has Trump up in Iowa with 37 percent to 26 percent for Cruz, who has led in some other Iowa polls. Trump did not repeat the “shoot somebody” line at a later rally in Pella, while stressing to the crowd there that he would tone down his rhetoric as president.    U.S. Republican presidential candidate and businessman Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally at the South Point Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada January 21, 2016. REUTERS/David Becker    BECK BACKS CRUZ Cruz responded to Trump at an event in Ankeny, where he picked up the endorsement of conservative firebrand Glenn Beck, a counterweight of sorts to Trump’s endorsement by 2008 vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin. “Listen, I will let Donald speak for himself. I can say I have no intention of shooting anybody in this campaign,” Cruz said. Beck was more direct. “There is one thing to have a healthy ego, there is another to give a man who believes those kind of things, who has a habit of anyone who stands in his way of destruction,” Beck said. “To give that man the full power and scope of the office of the presidency is something we will grow to regret.” Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley was an introductory speaker at Trump’s Pella event. Grassley did not endorse Trump but repeated Trump’s signature phrase, saying Republicans have a chance to “make America great again.” During his speech, Trump called Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly biased and said she should not be a moderator at a Fox-hosted Republican debate in Des Moines on Thursday. Kelly’s questioning at an Aug. 6 debate in Cleveland had prompted Trump to unleash a series of insults at her. There was no indication that Fox planned to remove her as a moderator. “Megyn Kelly has no conflict of interest. Donald Trump is just trying to build up the audience for Thursday’s debate, for which we thank him,” said a Fox News spokesperson. BLOOMBERG CONSIDERING INDEPENDENT BID The potential for more chaos in what has been a turbulent race on both the Republican and Democratic sides emerged on Saturday with the news that former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg might launch an independent run for president. A source said part of Bloomberg’s concern was the problem that Clinton is having in defeating Sanders. “I hope he runs,” Trump told reporters in Pella. At a First In The Nation forum for candidates in Nashua, New Hampshire, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush was notably withering in his criticism of Trump. He reminded voters of Trump’s dismissal of Senator John McCain as not a hero because he got captured during the Vietnam War. McCain spent 5-1/2 years as a prisoner of war. He was a two-time winner of the New Hampshire primary and the 2012 Republican presidential nominee. “It is not strong to insult women. It is not a sign of strength when you insult Hispanics. It is not a sign of strength when you say that a POW was a loser because they got caught. John McCain is a hero,” Bush said.

Here\\'s what sparked the idea — and how the plan unraveled.\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tDonald_Trump_Studios - Getty - H 2016\\n\\tGetty Images\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t \\nThe spring of 2012, Donald Trump was at a crossroads. The Apprentice, his once hugely successful NBC reality show, had been off the air for two years, while its spinoff, Celebrity Apprentice, was slumping in the ratings. He still had Miss Universe, but Trump University had folded, as had his gambling, vodka and steak businesses. Not for the first time, Trump contemplated a run for the presidency but instead ended up endorsing Mitt Romney. Then, out of the blue, a prospect presented itself that the real estate baron couldn’t resist, a chance to wield the sort of raw, fearsome power mere presidents can only dream of.\\nHow would he like to own a movie studio?\\nThe little-known tale of Trump World Studios — the time the Donald almost became a film and TV mogul — is not one Trump is particularly eager to recount. “It was a job I was thinking of doing, but I didn’t do it,” he told THR recently, brushing off a question about the failed venture attempted three years before he actually did run for president. But the story begins in April 2012 in Florida, where Trump was opening his newest golf resort, the Trump National Doral in Miami. And the first spark of the idea was ignited at a dinner Trump had arranged at Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach property, with a new friend on the Miami-Dade planning commission named Joe Martinez, a former cop and background actor (he did some work on Miami Vice) who at that time happened to be running for mayor of Miami.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tRelated Stories\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\nMartinez was shocked by Trump’s invitation — “We lived in two different worlds,” he says — but instantly recognized a once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity. Over dinner, as Martinez’s wife chatted with Melania Trump about “perfume and jewelry,” Martinez seized his chance. “I said, ‘Forgive me for bringing up business,’ then I made my pitch.” He proceeded to explain how, a decade earlier, he had attempted, with $50 million in backing from an Israeli investor, to turn an airplane hangar in Homestead, Fla., into a small film studio. The plan fell apart, but perhaps Trump might be interested in developing his own film and TV studio? “His wife liked the idea,” Martinez remembers, “which is always a good thing.”\\nBut Trump, being Trump, thought Martinez should think bigger. Instead of merely turning an old airplane hangar into a rinky-dink studio, Trump envisioned an entire studio city, built on 800 acres of undeveloped, government-owned land in Homestead — a rural, economically depressed part of Miami-Dade that still was recovering from Hurricane Andrew two decades earlier. In fact, what Trump had in mind was nothing less than the largest film and TV studio in the nation, twice the size of the Universal Studios Florida theme park. For Martinez, who long had looked for a way to increase development in Homestead — and who could certainly use a jobs-growing scheme to run on in the upcoming mayoral election — it was better than hitting the jackpot at an Atlantic City casino.\\n \\n \\n\\t?Architectural renderings of Trump Studio City — later renamed Trump World Studios. \\nTrump wasted no time in moving ahead on the project. He immediately engaged his favorite design firm, John Fotiadis Architect, to draw up plans. “He wanted a world-class facility,” recalls Fotiadis. “It was really like a city, with residential, commercial, retail, restaurants. It even had a grid, boulevards and a main plaza.” The massive production campus included 15 backlots, multiple sound studios ranging in size from 25,000 to 250,000 square feet (for a total of 1 million square feet of indoor space) and even a housing complex for employees. Fotiadis cranked out the plans as fast as he could — “Trump doesn’t waste people’s time; when he calls, we get to work right away,” he says — and within two months presented the finished designs to Trump and Martinez.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tRelated Stories\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\nOn June 5, 2012 — just two months after Martinez dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago —Trump World Studios was being pitched to the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners. The Trump exec doing the pitching was Michael Cohen, Trump’s special counsel and all-around consigliere.\\nBut Fotiadis was there, too, with his blueprints, as was Martinez, who a bit earlier had shared the plans with director Michael Bay, then shooting Pain & Gain in Miami. “I told him, ‘I need three minutes of your time,’ ” Martinez recalls, cornering Bay at a special proclamation ceremony they both were attending. “He said, ‘Nah, I gotta get back to The Rock and Mark Wahlberg.’ But I showed him the plans. He told me he could have shot Transformers [at Trump World Studios] if it were available.”\\nInspired by his chat with Bay, Martinez marched into a commissioners meeting and delivered a rousing, Braveheart-esque speech about the benefits of Trump building a studio in Homestead. “What does Hollywood have that we don’t?” he asked the commissioners. “What does L.A. have that we don’t? They are not as close to Central and South America as we are. They are not as close to the financial capital of the world as we are. They are not as close to Europe as we are. … Why can’t we have an industry that even the environmentalists like — the movie industry!”\\n \\n \\n\\tAt 800 acres (10 times the size of Disneyland), Trump Studio City would have been the largest film and TV production campus in America. \\nThe commission agreed to undertake a feasibility report — and that’s when things started to unravel. The plan presented by Trump involved him leasing the 800 acres from the government for one dollar a year. In return, Trump would spend “hundreds of millions” building the facilities. But as Cohen and his team delved deeper, they discovered that they needed to deal with about two dozen different entities to get the contiguous land they desired, and some of those entities already had plans for the property. Eighty-five acres had been set aside for “homeless assistance,” 35 for public schools and 213 for a park, and other acres already were being leased by the U.S. military. Plus, there were environmental concerns: The area was home to the eastern indigo snake, an endangered species. Trump dispatched another exec, Ed Russo, an “environmentalist” (and onetime Ernest Hemingway look-alike contest finalist) on whom Trump had called in the past to smooth feathers on ecologically sensitive deals (like when Trump turned John DeLorean’s 500-acre Victorian estate in New Jersey into a golf club).\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tRelated Stories\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\nBy all accounts, Trump was deadly serious about the project. “It was an opportunity for creating an economic development zone and thousands of jobs,” Cohen tells THR. “It would have done tremendous things for a lot of people.” But the obstacles seemed insurmountable, and in September 2012, Cohen told the media that the project was on hold. Still, Trump wasn’t ready to give up. A month later, he contradicted his counsel, sending a letter to the County Commissioners, stating, “I want to confirm my interest in pursuit of creating this new industry in South Florida and I know it will be a spectacular success.” Privately, Trump was reported to have told his lieutenants to “get it done.”\\nBut there was one problem that not even the mighty Trump could get past: noise. It turned out that he wanted to build Trump World Studios on land right next door to the worst neighbor a film studio could have — the Homestead Air Reserve Base, where military jets constantly were landing and taking off. “I actually said, ‘Can you move the Air Force base?’ ” Trump admitted, laughing. The answer was no, they couldn’t. The final nail in the coffin appears to have been Martinez losing his bid for mayor to a candidate not quite so keen on Trump World Studios. By November 2012, the project was officially dead. “The whole thing just went away,” says Sandy Lighterman, Miami-Dade’s film commissioner. “We offered to find other property, but Trump’s people weren’t interested.”\\nSince then, Lighterman says, others have kicked the tires on the Homestead acres, imagining another film studio in Florida, but it’s a tougher sell than ever since the state cut its tax-incentive program for filmmakers (it winds down completely June 30). Meanwhile, the land in Homestead remains largely vacant and undeveloped. And Trump has gone on to apply for a different job.\\n This story first appeared in the June 24 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

Blame Graydon Carter.   Nearly thirty years ago, when he was the co-editor of Spy magazine, Carter called Trump a \"short-fingered vulgarian.\" According to Carter, Trump has never forgotten the insult.   Carter, now the editor of Vanity Fair, resurrected it late last year as Trump surged ahead in the polls. Trump\\'s allegedly small hands have become a favorite target of Trump\\'s critics -- allowing for an easy segue to other parts of his anatomy.   Marco Rubio brought it up on the campaign trail last weekend. So that\\'s why Trump seemingly invoked his hand size -- and penis size -- in a shocking moment during Thursday night\\'s GOP debate.   \"He hit my hands. Nobody has ever hit my hands. I have never heard of this,\" Trump said. He held up his palms to the cameras and said look: \"Are they small hands?\"   The audience laughed approvingly.     Trump then pivoted back to Rubio and delivered what was, according to Facebook, the \"top social moment\" of the debate: \"And he referred to my hands, if they are small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there is no problem. I guarantee.\"   The Fox moderators didn\\'t acknowledge what was almost universally agreed to be a self-assessment of his penis.   But it was an OMG moment among professional commentators and ordinary viewers.   \"American politics has crossed the Rubicon of penis size,\" The New Republic editor Gabriel Snyder tweeted   \"Hope children aren\\'t watching this,\" said historian Michael Beschloss.   Trump\\'s remark was seen by some as the ultimate assertion of strength, of virility, in a campaign premised on winning.   To others, it was a sign of insecurity.   Trump said on stage that he had \"never heard of\" the small hands insult, but according to Carter\\'s editor letter in last November\\'s Vanity Fair, Trump has never forgotten it.   The \"short-fingered vulgarian\" line first appeared in print in 1988, when Carter and Kurt Andersen were running \"Spy,\" a satirical magazine.   \"To this day, I receive the occasional envelope from Trump,\" Carter wrote last November. \"There is always a photo of him — generally a tear sheet from a magazine. On all of them he has circled his hand in gold Sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers. I almost feel sorry for the poor fellow because, to me, the fingers still look abnormally stubby.\"   Carter said he received a \"See, not so short!\" message from Trump as recently as early 2015.   In January, the bodily critique gained new life among a group of conservative Trump opponents. Some of them shared pictures of Trump\\'s hands and compared them to baby hands.   Rubio invoked it last Sunday during a campaign stop in Virginia.   \"He\\'s like 6-foot-2\" but \"his hands are the size of someone who\\'s 5-2.\"   Rubio mocked Trump and set up a penis joke, saying, \"You know what they say about men with small hands?\" He paused, let the crowd cheer, and said, \"You can\\'t trust \\'em!\"   That same day, HBO host John Oliver brought up the \"short-fingered vulgarian\" line and Carter\\'s assertion that Trump has never forgotten about it.   \"Look, his fingers seem fine,\" Oliver said, \"But the very fact he\\'s so sensitive about them is absolutely hilarious.\"   Later in the segment, Oliver referred to Trump\\'s \"cocktail sausage fingers\" and \"tiny, tiny fingers.\"   All of this inspired The Washington Post to conduct a tongue-in-cheek investigation. For the record, its conclusion was that Trump \"is not short-fingered.\"   CNNMoney (New York) First published March 4, 2016: 8:38 AM ET    From the moment 17-year-old Donald Trump was named a captain for his senior year at New York Military Academy, he ordered the officers under his command to keep strict discipline. Shoes had to be shined. Beds had to be made. Underclassmen had to spring to attention. Then, a month into Trump’s tenure in the fall of 1963, came an abrupt change. The tall, confident senior with a shock of blond hair was removed from that coveted post atop A Company and transferred to a new job on the school staff — another prestigious assignment, but one with no command responsibilities. He moved out of the barracks and into the administration building, swapping jobs with a fellow high-ranking senior who took command of Trump’s old group. Explanations vary as to what actually happened. In Trump’s telling, he was elevated as a reward for stellar performance. “I had total control over the cadets,” he said in a recent interview. “That’s why I got a promotion — because I did so good.”    Donald Trump, on the “popularity poll” page of the1964 New York Military Academy yearbook. The caption below his photo reads “Ladies\\' man: Trump.” (Courtesy of New York Military Academy)  Former cadets recall the change differently. They say school administrators transferred Trump after a freshman named Lee Ains complained of being hazed by a sergeant under Trump’s command. School officials, those cadets say, were concerned that Trump’s style of delegating leadership responsibilities while spending a lot of time in his room, away from his team, allowed problems to fester. “They felt he wasn’t paying attention to his other officers as closely as he should have,” said Ains, who lives in Connecticut and works in the aerospace industry. Bill Specht, the cadet who switched places with Trump, recalled an administrator telling him about the hazing incident and saying that “the school has decided that they are going to make a switch.” The incident, previously unreported, offered an early glimpse into a pattern that would follow Trump through much of his life and has been evident in his rise as a leading Republican presidential candidate. Often the center of controversy, he finds a way to emerge by declaring victory and claiming success, even if the facts are more complicated and some people around him are left with sour feelings. The commandant who ordered the transfer, Col. Joseph C. Angello, has since died. School officials declined to comment. Trump often points to his five years at the academy in Cornwall-on-Hudson, about 60 miles from his home town of New York City, as a formative period in his life that helps qualify him to be commander in chief. Although he received educational and medical deferments from the Vietnam War draft, he has said that the school provided him “more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military.”    Donald John Trump, pictured in his 1964 New York Military Academy yearbook. (Courtesy of New York Military Academy)  “I did very well under the military system,” Trump said in an interview. “I became one of the top guys at the whole school.” Interviews with cadets who knew him well and a close mentor reveal a more complex picture of Trump’s experience at the school. As a maturing teenager, he began to exhibit some of the traits the world would come to know through his fame as a real estate mogul, reality TV star and White House contender. Even at an academy renowned for imposing strict standards on its cadets, Trump often managed to play by his own rules. He often left campus on weekends and drew the envy of fellow students for his habit of bringing attractive women to the school. He also stirred resentment from some in his orbit. A half-century later, discussing that time triggers discomfort and some bitterness among Trump’s former classmates. Ains, for instance, spoke of the episode reluctantly, after months of not returning phone calls, and only through a cracked door when a reporter appeared at his Connecticut home. Trump, 69, vigorously rejected the accounts of his former classmates’ recollections, lashing out at The Washington Post over the course of three phone interviews for “doing a lousy story.” He attacked his former fellow cadets, calling Ains’s account “fiction” and accusing him of speaking only “to get himself a little bit of publicity.” Regarding Specht, the cadet who replaced him in A Company, Trump said the transfer “was a promotion for me, and it was a demotion for him.” After an initial interview, Trump called The Post twice to argue his point. “I was promoted. The word is ‘promoted’ — Mark it down,” Trump said. ‘I liked to test people’ Trump’s military school education began in 1959. He was a 13-year-old with a history of trouble at school, and his father, Fred Trump, a prominent New York real estate developer, sent him to the academy to be straightened out. “As an adolescent, I was mostly interested in creating mischief,” Donald Trump wrote in “The Art of the Deal.” “I liked to stir things up, and I liked to test people.” New York Military Academy was founded in 1889 by Civil War veteran Charles Jefferson Wright. The school boasted of its record whipping rebellious youths into shape. “Courageous and gallant men have passed through these portals,” reads an inscription over the front door where frustrated parents dropped off their defiant sons. The school was as conservative in both its content and culture. Students were not allowed off campus during the week. On top of such courses as math and English, students tackled military history and learned how to fire rifles and mortars. Girls would not be allowed to attend until more than a decade later. Theodore Dobias, a World War II veteran and Army colonel who was a training officer at the school, said in an interview that he recalled the young cadet needing time to acclimate to the rigors of academy life. “At the beginning, he didn’t like the idea of being told what to do, like, ‘Make your bed, shine your shoes, brush your teeth, clean the sink, do your homework’ — all that stuff,” said Dobias, who became a mentor to Trump. Before Trump’s ascent to the rank of captain during the summer preceding his senior year, Trump was promoted steadily but unremarkably his first four years. During that time, he rose to the rank of supply sergeant while some fellow juniors were already lieutenants. He was quieter and humbler than he is now, some classmates said, and did not brag about his family’s wealth. “I remember having a conversation with him where he said his dad was a builder, and I said, ‘My dad was a builder, too,’\\u2009” said Jeffrey Pollack, who was in A Company. It wasn’t until several years later that Pollack picked up a news magazine, read about the Trump family fortune and realized what his classmate had meant. But even within the confines of a military school, there were hints of the brash and boastful persona now known as “The Donald.” Playing baseball, he stood out as a great first baseman, Dobias said. “Even then, he wanted to be number one,” Dobias said. “He wanted to be noticed. He wanted to be recognized. And he liked compliments.” Thanks to his athletic prowess, Dobias said, Trump was a “big shot” on campus. “And you get that by working hard, and he did work hard,” Dobias said. Fellow cadets recalled discussing how Trump carried himself as if he were destined for success, even if they were never sure if it was because of his charisma, his rank, his family’s wealth or some other reason. “There was some air about him,” recalled Michael Pitkow, “as if he knew he was just there passing time until he went on to something greater.  “He was self-confident and very soft-spoken, believe it or not, at the time,” added Pitkow, who said he overlapped with Trump for one year at the academy. He also noted that Trump, when he commanded A Company, seemed friendlier than other high-ranking students. “Occasionally, he inspected my company. He might have said something like, ‘Your shoes look good.’ He was usually pretty positive, unlike other commanders, who could be very driven by their egos and the power they commanded.” Philip Beckerman, who played varsity soccer with Trump, remembered his teammate as a “decent guy” with a lot of friends. “I always liked him,” Beckerman said. “He was very different than he projects himself today. He was down to earth.” ‘Definitely privileged’ Some former classmates said Trump seemed to enjoy luxuries others did not. His higher rank during his senior year allowed him to leave campus on weekends and holidays when other students remained at the school. Trump and several friends went on a chaperoned school trip to Bermuda, some former cadets said. Trump never received favorable treatment, Dobias and the candidate said. Yet some lower-ranking cadets wondered whether Trump’s wealth played a role. “He was definitely privileged,” said Douglas Reichel, who said he was a year behind Trump and a member of A Company. “That group of people got treated much differently. They got promoted each year.” Trump often brought young women to the school — although they weren’t allowed as far as his room — earning him the title of “Ladies’ Man” in his senior yearbook. “They were beautiful, gorgeous women, dressed out of Saks Fifth Avenue,” remembers George White, a former cadet who at the time spelled his last name Witek. Trump describes his time at the academy as a crucible in which he proved himself and learned to lead. “I think I was treated very much like everyone else,” he told The Post. “They had a lot of drill sergeants there. Literally, drill sergeants. And they were tough, and it was less politically correct than it is today. They were really rough cookies. You had to learn how to survive, essentially, with some of these guys. I learned discipline — how to dish it out and otherwise.” Trump’s appointment prior to his senior year as captain, presiding over NYMA’s most prestigious company, surprised some of his fellow cadets, particularly a handful who were ranked higher than him as juniors but suddenly found themselves behind him as seniors. “He was really an afterthought,” White said. “He didn’t show much as a freshman, sophomore or even a junior, because he would have already been more than a supply sergeant.” During his short stint as head of A Company, Trump had a hands-off approach to his position, according to five former cadets interviewed by The Post. He would usually head straight from dinner to his room, leaving his officers to inspect the cadets. In his absence, he would order his officers to keep younger cadets in line, and the atmosphere within A Company quickly became tense. Hazing was an integral part of school culture, and without the firm hand of A Company’s commander, underclassmen felt at risk, cadets said. “He was a delegator,” said Ains, the former cadet who said he was hazed. “I think he knew a lot of things [going on in the barracks], but I don’t know how far he dug into it.” Ains took the rare step of complaining to school administrators about the alleged hazing incident, in which he said a sergeant threw him against a wall. The sergeant was demoted, Ains remembers, and Trump was moved from A Company to the school staff. White, who as battalion commander was NYMA’s top-ranking cadet and the top member of the staff that Trump was switched to, recalls being shocked when the school commandant called him into his office to announce that Trump would be taking Specht’s spot. The move took place “to get him out of the barracks,” recalled White. “What was I going to say? That was the order.” Specht, Trump’s replacement, immediately cracked down on hazing in A Company, Ains said. “He would come around to the different rooms at any time and make sure that the students were studying and that they weren’t being interfered with by any older cadets,” Ains said. Specht said he remembers well the moment the school commandant gave him the news. “Colonel Angello called me down and said, ‘You’re going to go to A Company, and Donald is taking your position on the staff as a captain,’\\u2009” Specht recalled. Specht said Angello referred to a “hazing incident” in A Company as he explained that “the school has decided that they are going to make a switch.” The sudden swap was a disappointment for Specht, who had been at or near the top of his class since arriving at NYMA. “I obviously wasn’t happy about the switch, because it was more work for me,” he said. Specht, who served in the Navy after graduating from NYMA and is a Trump supporter, said he didn’t want to get into a public spat with the billionaire candidate. His wife, however, took the phone from her husband during an interview to challenge Trump’s account. “It’s a fact,” Christine Specht said. “I’m Bill’s wife, and he was not demoted.” Trump told The Post that he never saw any hazing at the school. “I did a good job, and that’s why I got elevated,” he said. “You don’t get elevated if you partake in hazing.” Trump, who in 2012 offered $5\\xa0million for the release of President Obama’s college transcript and other documents, said he would not give The Post permission to review his records from the military academy. “I’m not letting you look at anything,” he said. “Why would I let you look at my records? You’re doing a lousy story.” Dobias, Trump’s mentor, said he had no knowledge of the hazing incident that allegedly took place during Trump’s command. Dobias said he recalled that Trump’s replacement had been brought into A Company to keep a closer watch on cadets. Moving Trump “was the choice of the commandant, and there must have been a good reason for it,” Dobias said. “I think the guy who took over A Company was a little tougher on the kids than Donald was, so they moved [Trump] up onto the staff.” When told during a phone interview last month of Dobias’s comments, Trump called The Post back an hour later with the 89-year-old retired instructor on the line. “Dobie, let me ask you this,” Trump said, using his mentor’s nickname. “Did I have total control over everybody when I ran the company?” “Yes, you did,” Dobias answered. For 20 minutes, Trump pressed his former instructor to back up his account of receiving a “major promotion.” “Would you tell him officially that the word is ‘promoted’?” Trump told Dobias. When asked directly about Dobias’s comment that Trump had been switched out of A Company because he wasn’t tough enough on the cadets, Trump shot back: “I guarantee he didn’t say that.” A moment later, Dobias seemed to strike a middle ground: “Donald Trump wasn’t tough enough on the kids, so he got promoted on the staff.” Whatever the reason for Trump’s transfer, it ultimately served as a de facto promotion. It was Trump, not Specht, who chaperoned visiting dignitaries around the academy during their senior year. And it was Trump, not Specht, who, just a few days after the transfer, was put in charge of a special drill team for New York City’s Columbus Day parade. White, the school’s top cadet, recalled being told by the commandant to let Trump lead the school during the event. “He was singled out as early as October for special treatment,” said White. “They were keeping Trump busy and out of mischief.” On Oct. 12, a white-gloved Trump led not only NYMA but the entire parade down Fifth Avenue to St. Patrick’s Cathedral, where he was met by Cardinal Francis Spellman. For Trump, the photos of that day are proof enough that his time at NYMA was nothing but successful. “I was always good at that school,” he said. “Take a look at the pictures. I’m standing at the head of the whole place.” Alice Crites contributed to this report.   LET\\'S STOP BICKERING and just stipulate that Donald Trump is a creep. A real crumb bum, as the late Frank Rizzo would say. Or, as Mayor Kenney tweeted this week, a \"weirdo perv.\" Take your pick. The Trump campaign was in a tailspin Thursday as America finally came to the realization that the Republican presidential nominee is actually one of the reasons parents tell their kids not to talk to strangers. But did you know that Trump is also a bad tipper? Yep. Just ask Mike, a 35-year-old Delaware County nurse who once caddied for Trump as a teenager at a golf course in Westchester County, N.Y. It was an outing for some high rollers, Mike recalled this week. Other caddies pocketed tips ranging from $100 to more than $200. But Trump turned to Mike, then 14 years old, and slipped him three bills. They weren\\'t C-notes. We\\'re talking three lousy dollar bills. \"Not the craziest or greatest story,\" Mike said, \"but it did happen.\" That puts Trump - the \"carrot-colored charlatan,\" as Daily News columnist Helen Ubinas calls him - squarely in LeSean McCoy territory when it comes to crappy-tip stories, a staple of celebrity gossip columns worldwide. \"As I was taking his clubs to his car, he pulled out a \\'million\\' dollar bill and asked me if I had ever seen one before,\" Mike told Clout in an email. \"I laughed, knowing it was fake but still expecting a good payday. He put the fake bill back and then pulled out three one-dollar bills and handed them to me and said, \\'Thanks,\\' with a smirk on his face.\" We know what you\\'re thinking, Trump zealots: Who is this Mike character? Why is this surfacing now? Simmer down. Clout can vouch for him. He is family of longtime friends. We reached out to him after hearing of the story from a friend. Mike, in a telephone interview Thursday, asked us not to publish his last name because \"I don\\'t need Trump supporters coming to my door.\" We agreed, not because we have low standards - although we do - but because he has a valid concern, considering that people who have spoken out against Trump this year have received death threats. Anyway. Mike, who grew up in New York, had caddied for some time prior to crossing paths with Trump. He\\'d never experienced such a figurative slap in the face. Trump didn\\'t suggest that he had done anything wrong, either, so it was a mystery - just a billionaire being a prick, it seems. It left young Mike at a loss for words. \"I was 14 at the time. I was so shocked. Like, \\'OK, thanks,\\' \" he said. As onlookers rushed over asking how much Trump had tipped him, he walked back to the clubhouse in disbelief. They were expecting a huge figure from a man who Forbes estimates is worth $3.7 billion. \"Everyone was like, \\'Why didn\\'t you throw it back at him?\\' \" Mike said. \"I was so shocked, I just took it and walked away.\" Hey, Mike, maybe you\\'ll receive total consciousness on your deathbed like America\\'s greatest caddie, Carl Spackler.

       "'  Of the myriad groundbreaking firsts of Donald Trump\\'s presidency—the first billionaire president, the first reality television star president, the first admitted sexual assault-committing president, and so on and so forth—few of them are stranger than his status as the first president to have hours of radio interviews with satellite radio shock jock Howard Stern, many of which haven\\'t been revisited since his ascendance from occasional media personality to President of the United States. The good people at the Daily Beast have been going through some of the recently-published archival recordings, a task that I sincerely hope entails hazard pay. While uncomfortable anecdotes about his sex life with Melania or his wedding night with Marla Maples seem grimly unremarkable in the context of everything else we know about the president, this fun story, which Trump shared with Stern in July 2008 while discussing his lifelong aversion to blood, is a bit... different. Once upon a time, Trump explained matter-of-factly, he was hosting a charity ball at Mar-a-Lago at which several members of the Marine Corps were in attendance, along with a host of rich people \"eager to get their picture in the Palm Beach Post,\" as he put it. Lo and behold, at some point during the evening, an 80-year-old man—\"very wealthy,\" Trump adds, but also, \"a lot of people didn\\'t like him\"—fell off the stage and hit his head. Trump thought the man had died. \"And you know what I did?\" How do you, a functional adult with the capacity for empathy and/or human emotion writ large, react when you see someone undergoing a bona fide medical emergency? Do you instinctively go to that person? Do you render aid, even if your lack of expertise limits that task to asking if they are alright, and if they need help? Even if you know you have a strong aversion to blood, perhaps you adapt to this idiosyncrasy by calling 911, or by asking if anyone in the immediate vicinity is a physician, or other medical professional, or just a non-hemophobe who might be able to provide more efficacious assistance. These are all rational, humane responses to the situation in which Donald Trump found himself, and yet, in news that will shock you, he did not choose any of them.  I said, ‘Oh my God, that’s disgusting,’ and I turned away. I couldn’t—you know, he was right in front of me, and I turned\\naway. I didn’t want to touch him.  As Stern and company yukked it up at this expertly-delivered punchline, Trump continued.  He’s bleeding all over the place, I\\nfelt terrible. You know, beautiful marble floor, didn’t look like it.\\nIt changed color. Became very red.       Sign up to our Evening Headlines email for your daily guide to the latest news Sign up to our free US Evening Headlines email     Donald Trump found it difficult to concentrate during a visit from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe because he was \"obsessed with the translator’s breasts\", according to the editor-in-chief of Vanity Fair magazine.   Graydon Carter claimed a source told him the US President admitted he was preoccupied with the woman during Mr Abe\\'s stay in Washington DC and visit to Mr Trump\\'s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last month.  During the visit in February, it was reported Trump crafted his response to a North Korean ballistic missile test in the crowded dining room off the club. It was the test of President Trump\\'s vow to get tough on isolated North Korea, which tested nuclear devices and ballistic missiles last year at an unprecedented rate. “The president told an acquaintance that he was obsessed with the translator’s breasts,\" Mr Carter wrote in his latest editor\\'s letter for the magazine. He added that Mr Trump had \"expressed this in his own, fragrant fashion.\" Read more In an email to the  New York Daily News , Mr Carter insisted that he had a credible source for his remarks, but declined to elaborate further. Mr Carter has an ongoing feud with Mr Trump and has used all of his editor’s letters to attack the President since he was elected.  His headlines have included: “Donald Trump: A Pillar of Ignorance and Certitude”; “Trump\\'s White House: The Gang That Couldn\\'t Shoot Straight”; and the most recent one, containing the allegations about the translator is entitled: “The Trump Presidency Is Already A Joke.” The US leader lashed out against the magazine in December after it published a review of his Trump Tower steakhouse which said it could be the worst restaurant in America.  Taking to Twitter within hours of its publication, he wrote: “Has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine. Way down, big trouble, dead! Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out!” After his outburst, the magazine\\'s subscriptions increased, according to circulation statistics.  Mimicking Mr Trump\\'s style on the social media site, Vanity Fair tweeted: “Vanity Fair: Way up, big success, alive! Subscribe today!” Mr Trump suffered a series of set backs in understanding Mr Abe during his visit. At a joint news conference with his Japanese counterpart the US leader was caught not using his translation earpiece and was instead forced to smile, nod along, and take cues from members of the audience who could understand what Mr Abe was saying.   \\n\\n\\n\\nVisiting a fourth-grade class in Florida on Friday, President Donald Trump advised one student to “make a lot of money” in her career and offered to make two other 10-year-old students “famous” by taking a picture with them.\\nTrump visited with the class at St. Andrew Catholic School in Pine Hills, Florida, on Friday afternoon alongside his education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Sen. Marco Rubio — and Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner. The president was at the school to discuss school choice, policies advocated by DeVos.\\nAccording to a pool report, Trump stopped by the class of about 25 students, some of whom gasped when they saw the president in the hallway.\\n\\n\\nTrump described the class as “beautiful,” and then two 10-year-old students welcomed him. He chatted with some of the students, including one girl who told him she wanted to start her own business someday. \\nTrump, himself an entrepreneur, replied: “That’s a good idea. Make a lot of money, right? But don’t run for politics after.”\\nBefore Trump left the classroom, the two students who had welcomed him said thank you and gave him a card they made to honor Florida’s birthday. Trump offered to pose for a photo with them, and said, “We’re going to make you famous, OK?”\\n\\n\\n\\n   President Trump paid $38 million in federal taxes in 2005 on income of $153\\xa0million and reported a $105\\xa0million write-down in business losses, according to a copy of his tax return first revealed Tuesday night. Trump paid an effective tax rate of 24 percent and saved millions of dollars in additional taxes by claiming the losses, according to the document, the first two pages of which were obtained by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Cay Johnston and first reported by DC Report, a nonprofit news site he runs, and on MSNBC\\'s\\xa0“The Rachel Maddow Show.”  The return shows that Trump paid $36.5\\xa0million in income tax, of which about $31\\xa0million was in the form of an “alternative minimum tax,” a supplemental tax designed to cut down on filers with excessive deductions. He also paid about $1.5\\xa0million in Medicare and Social Security taxes. The document offers a rare snapshot of Trump’s personal finances, considering he has refused to disclose his tax returns to the public. The White House issued a statement chastising MSNBC for reporting on Trump’s taxes — “totally illegal,” read the statement — but also confirming top-line numbers from the return and defending Trump. Still, Trump tweeted early Wednesday that the report was \"FAKE NEWS\" and asked: \"Does anybody really believe that a reporter, who nobody ever heard of, \\'went to his mailbox\\' and found my tax returns?\" Trump’s taxes were a major flash point in last year’s campaign and continue to be a subject of intense scrutiny from Democrats and others who believe they would show whether he has financial relationships with any Russian entities. The newly revealed pages from his 2005 return do not detail his financial ties, but they do seem to disprove the theory that some Democrats advanced in last year’s campaign that Trump avoided paying any federal income taxes during that period.    Video: What you need to know about Trump\\'s 2005 tax return (Video: Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)    In their first general-election debate, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton speculated about Trump, “maybe he doesn’t want the American people — all of you watching tonight — to know that he’s paid nothing in federal taxes.” At that, Trump quipped, “That makes me smart.” Donald Trump Jr., the president’s oldest son, tweeted, “Thank you Rachel Maddow for proving to your #Trump hating followers how successful @realDonaldTrump is& that he paid $40mm in taxes! #Taxes” Last fall, the New York Times revealed that Trump reported a massive $916\\xa0million loss in 1995, which he could have carried over to allow him to offset taxable income and avoid paying income taxes for up to 18 years. Though Trump was able to use those net losses as a deduction in 2005, the returns show, they did not zero out his tax obligation altogether. Trump used real estate deductions to pay no federal income taxes in 1978 and 1979, according to Trump tax returns submitted years ago to New Jersey regulators. Much of those losses came from a deduction offered to real estate developers, like Trump, allowing them to subtract from their income on the basis that buildings depreciate in value over time.    Trump could have used a dubious tactic called a \\'stock-for-debt\\' swap to avoid paying taxes. Here\\'s how that work (Video: Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)    Trump repeatedly has refused to release his income tax returns — breaking with four decades of tradition for presidential nominees — claiming that he has been under audit and that his lawyers have counseled him not to release them. The Internal Revenue Service has not confirmed that it is auditing Trump’s taxes. The Washington Post could not independently verify the 2005 return, but a statement from the White House indicated that it is authentic. The statement, issued to reporters anonymously to be attributed to a White House spokesperson, accused MSNBC of unlawfully releasing Trump’s tax returns. “You know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago,” the statement said. It added that Trump, as “one of the most successful businessmen in the world,” paid “no more tax than legally required.” The statement went on to say: “Mr. Trump paid $38\\xa0million dollars even after taking into account large scale depreciation for construction, on an income of more than $150\\xa0million dollars, as well as paying tens of millions of dollars in other taxes such as sales and excise taxes and employment taxes and this illegally published return proves just that. Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns. The dishonest media can continue to make this part of their agenda, while the President will focus on his, which includes tax reform that will benefit all Americans.” The tax documents were sent to Johnston, a veteran investigative reporter who specializes in taxes and formerly worked at the New York Times. He speculated on air to Maddow that Trump himself may have sent him the returns. The return shows Trump and wife Melania paid most of their income taxes as an alternative minimum tax. Taxpayers requesting many itemized deductions must pay the AMT in certain circumstances. The AMT rejects specific deductions, including for dependents and assorted real estate write-downs. In his tax-reform plan, Trump has called for eliminating the AMT. The return shows that Trump’s business income in 2005 totaled roughly $42\\xa0million, with capital gains from investments totaling roughly $32\\xa0million and income from partnerships, trusts and so-called “S corporations” totaling roughly $67\\xa0million. Trump used roughly $103\\xa0million in net operating losses, carried over from previous years, to greatly lower that tax obligation. Trump also used such losses, likely from a series of costly business failures and Atlantic City bankruptcies, to lower his tax bill in 1995. Trump has routinely taken pride in his aggressive working of the nation’s tax laws. “I have brilliantly used those laws,” Trump said at a campaign event in October. “I was able to use the tax laws of this country, and my business acumen, to dig out of the real estate mess — you would call it a depression — when few others were able to do what I did.” Trump’s reported income in 2005 may call into question his net worth. Trump says he is now worth more than $10\\xa0billion, but independent estimators have said that figure may be overstated. In 2005, Trump said he was worth more than $5\\xa0billion. Trump sued author Timothy O’Brien after his 2005 book, “TrumpNation,” cited anonymous sources suggesting Trump was instead worth $150 to $250\\xa0million. In depositions from that case, O’Brien’s attorneys revealed estimates from two lenders to Trump, North Fork Bank and Deutsche Bank, who suggested Trump’s net worth was between $800\\xa0million and $1.2\\xa0billion. Trump’s current finances are set to face a new test with the coming April 18 tax deadline. He has steadfastly refused to release his returns, pointing both to ongoing audits and to his belief that Americans do not care to see them. However, a Pew Research Center survey in January found that 60 percent of Americans believe that Trump has a responsibility to release his returns. All U.S. presidents are automatically audited every year, as prescribed by a guideline in the Internal Revenue Service manual in place for presidents and vice presidents since the 1970s. Trump could urge Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to change that provision, legal experts said. Trump has not said whether he would do so.  \\n\\n\\n \\n   \\nPresident Donald Trump pauses alongside students before signing a memorandum to expand access to STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education in the Oval Office at the White House, on September 25, in Washington, D.C. \\nKevin Dietsch-Pool/Getty Images\\n    Donald Trump has said he is a germaphobe who washes his hands frequently throughout the day and needs to drink through a straw because he wants to avoid contamination. The president discussed his obsessive-compulsive tendencies during the course of 15 hours of interviews with The Howard Stern Show between 1993 and 2015 that have been obtained exclusively by Newsweek.  In a 1993 interview, Stern said: \"Today, we learned some interesting things [about Donald Trump]: He\\'s very wealthy and yet he\\'s a prisoner of obsessive-compulsive disorder.\" Trump was asked: \"You have to wash your hands, how many times a day?\" He responded: \"Well as many as possible.\" The Republican also said he liked to drink through a straw rather than straight out of a glass. \"I\\'d prefer drinking through a straw if I\\'m going to a restroom,\" he said. Stern asked: \"Because you are afraid that the glasses can be contaminated?\" \"They certainly can be,\" Trump replied. The host told Trump that his obsessive hand washing could be a sign of a psychological problem, to which Trump responded: \"It could be a psychological problem,\" adding that he had managed to sit through the interview without leaving to wash his hands. \"I like it. I like cleanliness. Cleanliness is a nice thing. Not only hands, body, everything,\" Trump added, telling Stern he had never sought professional help for his compulsive behavior. The pair also discussed urinals, with Trump telling Stern he often had people come up to shake his hands after they had used the bathroom and held onto the urinal for support. \"OK, now tell me, tell me, you ever watch, I watch in amazement. They\\'re standing there grabbing the urinal for balance,\" Trump said. \"And then they come up and they say, \\'Mr. Trump I\\'m a big fan. I\\'d like to shake your hand….\\' I may be a bad guy, when you say excuse me, you were just holding the urinal,\" he continued. The president added he didn\\'t believe people knew what they were doing, explaining: \"They go up and they, they want to shake your hand. They\\'re not doing it to be bad people.\"  \\n   The grieving father stood with his guitar and his cowboy hat in the cold, crowded lines for hours, driving to towns big and small in nearly every corner of the country. Beginning in January 2016, Kraig Moss traveled to 45 rallies, belting out songs in support of Donald Trump and telling the story of his late son, Rob, who died three years ago from a heroin overdose. In this way, the musician earned the title of \"the Trump Troubadour,\" a true believer said to symbolize \"the voice of unheard America.\" He stopped making his mortgage payments and sold the equipment for his construction business to stay on the campaign trail, galvanized by Trump\\'s promise to help young people —\\xa0like Moss\\' late son —\\xa0who struggle with drug addiction. Trump, Moss thought, was the candidate most capable of bringing an end to the heroin epidemic sweeping the nation. Trump made this promise to Moss personally at a rally in Iowa in January 2016. Speaking through a microphone to the crowd, he addressed Moss directly: \"The biggest thing we can do in honor of your son ... we have to be able to stop it.\" \"I know what you went through. And he\\'s a great father,\" he said of Moss to the crowd. \"I can see it. And your son is proud of you.\" But about two weeks ago, Moss caught his first glimpse of the Republican proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act. The proposed health care bill, slated for floor vote in the House Thursday night, would eliminate a requirement that Medicaid cover basic mental-health and addiction services in states that expanded it, a mandate that covered nearly 1.3 million people. \"This bill is just the absolute opposite,\" Moss told the Washington Post. \"I felt betrayed. I felt let down.\" He had put all his weight behind the Republican\\'s promise, sacrificing his business and his livelihood to sing Trump\\'s praises. But this bill backed by the president \"disgusted\" him. He no longer sings songs about Trump, and he now wonders if any of his sacrifices were worth it. \"You hear that echo?\" he said in a phone interview from his home in upstate New York. \"That\\'s because there\\'s no furniture in this house. It\\'s completely gutted.\" \"The one platform that I was just so genuinely involved in with my heart was the one thing that he just turned right around,\" Moss said. \"He\\'s turning his back on all of us.\" He had hoped to see provisions in the bill calling for boosted resources for addiction treatment centers, lower deductibles and lower overall health care costs. If Trump wanted to, Moss said, he could \"wave his pen\" and provide funding necessary to supply emergency responders in every small town in America with naloxone kits to reverse possible heroin overdoses. \"Every one of those doses of Narcan represents a saved life,\" Moss said. \"If the emergency squad that came down to save my son had that dose, my son would\\'ve been alive today.\" That day was Jan 6, 2014. Moss, a single father, came home from work and called out Rob\\'s name, like he always did. \"I didn\\'t hear anything,\" he recalled. In the basement bedroom downstairs, Moss found his 24-year-old son lying unconscious in bed with his arms resting across his chest. Next to him was the book he had just been reading, The Wise Man\\'s Fear. Later, Moss would find the needle. He called 911 and tried to revive his son through mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. An emergency response team arrived and was unable to bring him back. An autopsy later confirmed the cause of death: an overdose of fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller up to 100 times stronger than morphine. Trump had told the father, \"I know what you went through.\" \"We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth,\" he said in his speech before Congress on Feb. 28, \"and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.\" Now, Moss said he wishes he could ask the president, \"Have you even read the bill?\" The health care proposal would roll back the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act — commonly known as Obamacare —\\xa0which would affect many states bearing the brunt of the opiate crisis, including Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia. The Republican overhaul is spearheaded by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), and backed by Trump. Republicans argue that the change would give states additional flexibility in coverage decisions, and believe they would continue to provide addiction and mental-health coverage to Medicaid recipients if needed. But advocates say the overhaul could be crushing for addiction treatment services, particularly for the poorest, most vulnerable patients. A record number of people —\\xa033,000 — died of opiate overdoses in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Pay close attention to what you tell people you\\'re going to do and make some kind of effort to follow through,\" Moss said. \"Pay more attention to the needs of the people.\" Moss said he initially supported many of Trump\\'s other promises as well, such as his pledge to build a border wall with Mexico. But lately he has been upset hearing the stories of families being separated by deportations. \"If I contributed to anything like that I\\'d be ashamed of myself,\" he said. Many have been criticizing Moss for publicly voicing his disappointment with Trump, but he knows there must be many others feeling similar pangs of regret or betrayal. \"I was very instrumental in getting these \\'closet Trumpsters\\' to come out\" during the presidential campaign, Moss said. In a similar way, he hopes he can encourage other disillusioned Americans to speak up about their concerns with the new administration. \"I\\'m not the lone ranger out here doing this,\" he said. \"It\\'s a little guy like me that put Trump in the office,\" and it\\'s the \"little guys\" who can call lawmakers and ask for a new health care proposal, he said. \"Don\\'t turn your head on this problem Mr. Trump,\" Moss said.   WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said he wanted what amounted to a nearly tenfold increase in the U.S. nuclear arsenal during a gathering this past summer of the nation’s highest-ranking national security leaders, according to three officials who were in the room. Trump’s comments, the officials said, came in response to a briefing slide he was shown that charted the steady reduction of U.S. nuclear weapons since the late 1960s. Trump indicated he wanted a bigger stockpile, not the bottom position on that downward-sloping curve. According to the officials present, Trump’s advisers, among them the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, were surprised. Officials briefly explained the legal and practical impediments to a nuclear buildup and how the current military posture is stronger than it was at the height of the buildup. In interviews, they told NBC News that no such expansion is planned.     The July 20 meeting was described as a lengthy and sometimes tense review of worldwide U.S. forces and operations. It was soon after the meeting broke up that officials who remained behind heard Tillerson say that Trump is a “moron.”  Revelations of Trump’s comments that day come as the U.S. is locked in a high-stakes standoff with North Korea over its nuclear ambitions and is poised to set off a fresh confrontation with Iran by not certifying to Congress that Tehran is in compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal.     Trump convened a meeting Tuesday with his national security team in which they discussed “a range of options to respond to any form of North Korean aggression or, if necessary, to prevent North Korea from threatening the U.S. and its allies with nuclear weapons,” according to the White House. The president’s comments during the Pentagon meeting in July came in response to a chart shown on the history of the U.S. and Russia’s nuclear capabilities that showed America’s stockpile at its peak in the late 1960s, the officials said. Some officials present said they did not take Trump’s desire for more nuclear weapons to be literally instructing the military to increase the actual numbers. But his comments raised questions about his familiarity with the nuclear posture and other issues, officials said. Two officials present said that at multiple points in the discussion, the president expressed a desire not just for more nuclear weapons, but for additional U.S. troops and military equipment. Any increase in America’s nuclear arsenal would not only break with decades of U.S. nuclear doctrine but also violate international disarmament treaties signed by every president since Ronald Reagan. Nonproliferation experts warned that such a move could set off a global arms race.  An inert Minuteman 3 missile in a training launch tube at Minot Air Force Base in 2014. Charlie Riedel / AP file  “If he were to increase the numbers, the Russians would match him, and the Chinese” would ramp up their nuclear ambitions, Joe Cirincione, a nuclear expert and an MSNBC contributor, said, referring to the president. “There hasn’t been a military mission that’s required a nuclear weapon in 71 years,” Cirincione said. Details of the July 20 meeting, which have not been previously reported, shed additional light on tensions among the commander in chief, members of his Cabinet and the uniformed leadership of the Pentagon stemming from vastly different world views, experiences and knowledge bases.  Related: Tillerson\\'s Fury at Trump Required Intervention From Pence   Moreover, the president’s comments reveal that Trump, who suggested before his inauguration that the U.S. “must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability,” voiced that desire as commander in chief directly to the military leadership in the heart of the Pentagon this summer. Some officials in the Pentagon meeting were rattled by the president’s desire for more nuclear weapons and his understanding of other national security issues from the Korean Peninsula to Iraq and Afghanistan, the officials said. That meeting followed one held a day earlier in the White House Situation Room focused on Afghanistan in which the president stunned some of his national security team. At that July 19 meeting, according to senior administration officials, Trump asked military leaders to fire the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and compared their advice to that of a New York restaurant consultant whose poor judgment cost a business valuable time and money. Two people familiar with the discussion said the Situation Room meeting, in which the president’s advisers anticipated he would sign off on a new Afghanistan strategy, was so unproductive that the advisers decided to continue the discussion at the Pentagon the next day in a smaller setting where the president could perhaps be more focused. “It wasn’t just the number of people. It was the idea of focus,” according to one person familiar with the discussion. The thinking was: “Maybe we need to slow down a little and explain the whole world” from a big-picture perspective, this person said. The Pentagon meeting was also attended by Vice President Mike Pence; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Gen. Paul Selva, the vice chairman; Defense Secretary James Mattis; Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan; Stephen Bannon, then Trump’s chief strategist; Jared Kushner, the president\\'s son-in-law and senior adviser; and Reince Preibus, then chief of staff. Sean Spicer, then the White House spokesman, and Keith Schiller, who was director of Oval Office operations at the time, also accompanied Trump to the Pentagon that day.  Related: Donald Trump Has History of Mixed Messages on Nuclear Weapons   Asked for a response to the president’s comments, a White House official speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the nuclear arsenal was not a primary topic of the briefing. Dana White, spokesperson for the Pentagon said “the secretary of defense has many closed sessions with the president and his cabinet members. Those conversations are privileged.” President Trump responded Wednesday morning on Twitter: Later Wednesday, the president said he \"never discussed increasing\" the size of the nuclear arsenal, repeating his claim of \"fake news.\" \"Right now, we have so many nuclear weapons,\" Trump said at a press availability with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. \"I want them in perfect condition, perfect shape. That\\'s the only thing I\\'ve ever discussed.\" Defense Secretary Mattis also called the NBC report \"absolutely false.\" At the time of the meeting, White told reporters that the meeting “covered the planet,” and that the president’s advisers “went around the world,” outlining what she described as the challenges and opportunities for the U.S. Two senior administration officials said the president’s advisers outlined the reasons an expansion of America’s nuclear arsenal is not feasible. They pointed to treaty obligations and budget restraints and noted to him that today’s total conventional and nonconventional military arsenal leaves the U.S. in a stronger defense posture than it was when the nuclear arsenal alone was larger. Still, officials said they are working to address the president’s concerns within the Nuclear Posture Review, which is expected to be finalized by the end of 2017 or early next year. “He’s all in for modernization,” one official said. “His concerns are the U.S. stopped investing in this.”     Officials present said that Trump’s comments on a significantly increased arsenal came in response to a briefing slide that outlined America’s nuclear stockpile over the past 70 years. The president referenced the highest number on the chart — about 32,000 in the late 1960s — and told his team he wanted the U.S. to have that many now, officials said. The U.S. currently has around 4,000 nuclear warheads in its military stockpile, according to the Federation of American Scientists. The Pentagon is currently undergoing the long-planned posture review. Modernizing the arsenal is a step presidents continuously take that doesn’t put the U.S. in violation of treaty obligations, Cirincione said. “You don’t get in trouble for modernizing,\" he said. \"You do get in trouble if you do one of two things: if you increase the numbers. The strategic weapons are treaty limited. Two, if you build a new type of weapon that is prohibited by a treaty.\"  Related: Tillerson Summoned to White House Amid Trump Fury   It’s unclear which portion of the Pentagon briefing prompted Tillerson to call the president a “moron” after the meeting broke up and some advisers were gathered around. Officials who attended the two-hour session said it included a number of tense exchanges. At one point, Trump responded to a presentation on the U.S. military presence in South Korea by asking why South Koreans aren’t more appreciative and welcoming of American defense aid. The comment prompted intervention from a senior military official in the room to explain the overall relationship and why such help is ultimately beneficial to U.S. national security interests. Trump has been inconsistent with regards to his stance on nuclear weapons. At one of the earliest Republican debates, in December of 2015, then-candidate Trump seemed to stumble through a question about the nuclear triad, the land, air, and sea-based systems present in a traditional nuclear arsenal. Asked three months later about U.S. policy on nonproliferation, Trump said on CNN: \"Maybe it’s going to have to be time to change, because so many people, you have Pakistan has it, you have China has it.” When pressed, he allowed, \"I don’t want more nuclear weapons.” But his suggestion that the world could see an increase in nuclear weapons after decades of post-Cold War reductions rattled America’s allies and drew criticism from foreign policy experts and U.S. officials at the time. The president left the Pentagon on July 20, telling reporters the meeting was “absolutely great.”   Many white nationalists have been praising President Trump after he doubled-down on blaming \"both sides\" in the deadly Charlottesville protests. \"What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt?\" Trump asked reporters in an explosive press conference Tuesday. \"What about the fact they came charging with clubs in hands, swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do.\" The remarks were widely panned as an endorsement of white supremacy following the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, but were embraced by some racist hate groups.     \"Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists,\" tweeted former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. Baked Alaska, another far-right-wing activist, thanked Trump for \"condemning the alt-left antifa [anti-fascist] thugs who attacked us in Charlottesville.\" Members of Trump\\'s staff told NBC News they were stunned by the direction the president took at the press conference, which was supposed to focus on infrastructure, a day after the White House had quelled the controversy over Trump\\'s initial response to the protests. After reacting to critics on Monday who argued he didn\\'t take a strong enough stance the first time, Trump doubled down a day later on his insistence that both the white nationalists and the counter-protesters shared responsibility for the violence over the weekend. One of those counter-protesters, Heather Heyer, was killed when a car rammed into the crowd.  Related: Democratic, Republican Lawmakers Decry Trump’s Latest Charlottesville Remarks   While one senior White House official told NBC News that Trump “went rogue” on Tuesday, his impromptu comments were welcomed by alt-right leader Richard Spencer, who told the Atlantic he felt they were \"fair\" and \"down to earth.\" And William Johnson, a white nationalist, told NBC News\\' Jacob Soboroff on Wednesday he was thrilled by what Trump said. \"I think that America needs to take a different direction,\" Johnson said. \"We have a festering racial problem that\\'s only going to get worse. I think the only solution is separation ... and Donald Trump is going to, I think, help us overcome the racial divide.\" He added that he felt Trump is emboldening Americans “to be proud of their heritage — whether it is white, whether it is Confederacy, whatever it is.” Johnson called Trump \"honest\" for reiterating that he thinks there is \"blame on both sides.\" \"He is the most honest president since George Washington and the cherry tree,\" Johnson said. \"That is an honest man saying what he believes in his heart.\" This is not the first time Trump has flirted with white supremacists. Last year, he ignited a firestorm when he declined to renounce support from KKK leader Duke before eventually being forced to disavow him. Another time, his presidential campaign tweeted an image of Hillary Clinton with a Jewish star that originated from an extremist, then claimed it was a sheriff’s badge, drawing ire. And Trump has tweeted fake, racist crime statistics saying black people are more violent, while defending their credibility. All these moves, said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, embolden white nationalists. \"This is nothing new. President Trump\\'s disastrous statements yesterday are just the latest example of an unbroken series of green lights to the white nationalist movement,\" Levin said.  Related: Trump’s Latest Charlottesville Remarks Are Condemned Abroad   That\\'s cause for alarm, given the effect that past statements from Trump have had, he added. \"We saw a dramatic spike in hate crimes, anti-Muslim hate crimes, in the five days after President Trump\\'s Muslim ban proposal, and we\\'ve had more of these mega-large, white nationalist rallies in the last two years than we\\'ve had in the previous 10 or 20,\" he said. \"Words matter.\" Arno Michaelis, a former white supremacist who has renounced his racist past, told MSNBC the Trump administration speaks \"the same kind of language\" as hate groups.     \"I think it\\'s very emboldening for hate groups to see a policy that reflects things that they\\'ve been saying for a long time. Hate groups exist on fear, they cultivate fear. That\\'s their bread and butter. And when we have an administration that also deals in fear, they\\'re all speaking the same kind of language,\" Michaelis said. Members of Trump\\'s own party seared him after Tuesday\\'s remarks.     \"Pathetic,\" Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich told the TODAY Show on Wednesday. \"What are we doing to our children? To not condemn these people who went there to carry out violence and to somehow draw some kind of equivalency to somebody else reduces the ability to totally condemn these hate groups.\" Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney also refuted Trump\\'s insistence that both sides were to blame. \"No, not the same. One side is racist, bigoted, Nazi. The other opposes racism and bigotry. Morally different universes,\" he tweeted.       Politics apparently wasn\\'t President Trump\\'s only focus when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited the White House last month. While Abe was in town, Trump allegedly told a friend that he was \"obsessed\" with a translator\\'s breasts, according to Vanity Fair editor-in-chief Graydon Carter. \"He expressed this in his own, fragrant fashion,\" Carter wrote in his most recent editor\\'s letter, published Wednesday.

(CARLOS BARRIA/REUTERS)    Repaying the presumably unintended favor, Vanity Fair tweeted, \"Vanity Fair: Way up, big success, alive! Subscribe today!\" Carter, for his part, has blasted Trump in every single editor\\'s letter published since Election Day. Headlines for those letters include \"Donald Trump: A Pillar of Ignorance and Certitude,\" \"Trump\\'s White House: The Gang That Couldn\\'t Shoot Straight\" and the most recent one, containing the \"breast\" allegations, \"The Trump Presidency Is Already A Joke.\"   \\n A lawyer for Donald Trump wrote a letter to the Onion, a satirical news website, more than four years ago to complain that an \"absolutely disgusting piece\" about the businessman be taken down.  \\n  The mock article in question, back from January 2013, shows Trump as the author. It\\'s headline is: \"When You\\'re Feeling Low, Just Remember I\\'ll Be Dead in About 15 or 20 Years.\"  \\n  New York Magazine reports that Michael Cohen, then a special counsel for the Trump Organization, demanded the Onion take the piece down or face legal action. Cohen is no longer affiliated with the Trump organization, working as President Trump\\'s personal attorney.  \\n  \"Let me begin,\" Cohen wrote in the letter, \"by stating the obvious ... that the commentary was not written by Mr. Trump. Secondly, the article is an absolutely disgusting piece that lacks any place in journalism; even in your Onion. I am hereby demanding that you immediately remove this disgraceful piece from your website and issue an apology to Mr. Trump.\"  \\n  In the piece, the fake Trump personality envisions a number of ways he could die, including a \"slow, excruciating kidney failure,\" \"a massive heart attack while I\\'m delivering a speech to investors,\" Alzheimers or \"a vicious form of cancer that at first appears to be responding well to chemotherapy but then takes a rapid and inescapable turn for the worse.\"  \\n  \"In the not-very-distant future I will die and then be gone from the world for all eternity. You may even get to watch me in a casket on national television being lowered into the ground, never to be seen again. I bet you\\'re smiling just thinking about that,\" the piece reads.  \\n  The Onion\\'s editor-in-chief, Cole Bolton, said the site \"never apologized,\" and noted that the article is still online.  \\n  The Onion continued to feature stories from faux Trump. Three published during the 2016 campaign, including one from August 2016 titled: \" I Spend Every Waking Moment Holding This Fragile Facade Of A Person Together, And I\\'ll Do The Same For America.\"  \\n  Bolton added that at the Onion, \"We\\'ve always thought of him as a horrendous buffoon, an objectionable person.\" \\n   \\n \\n\\t \\t\\n \\n This is an archived article that was published on sltrib.com in 2017, and information in the article may be outdated. It is provided only for personal research purposes and may not be reprinted.\\n \\n  It has been said, \"Nobody speaks for Donald Trump but Donald Trump.\" He says so many things that are untrue that his credibility is little to none. His penchant for conspiracy theories overrides his ability to absorb sound, logical information. He has weak impulse control, and he is an addictive cycle of rage and Twitter abuse.   Now that he is in the spotlight of notoriety, he is acting as if he is guilty of something. He made an unfounded allegation about President Barack Obama ordering surveillance on him. He lashed out with a lie that reflects his own sense of guilt. I think that the gravity of this situation is of the most serious nature in the history of this country. Who in the world would believe this man? The Republicans must stand up and stop him from politicizing the truth.   Trump never takes responsibility for his actions. He has blamed everyone around him for the disarray in his administration. He has a tremendous need to justify his behavior with the affirmation, gratitude and respect of his fans. This is an alternate reality show running amok. \\t\\n \\n\\t Who knows how deep his ties to the Russians go? Why will he not release his tax returns? It could be possible that his financial dealings could run afoul of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act on some of his projects. It is not the future that troubles me as much as repeating all of the past normalizations of the bad behaviors of our clueless leader. \\n  President Trump defended the white nationalists who protested in Charlottesville on Tuesday, saying they included “some very fine people,” while expressing sympathy for their demonstration against the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. It was a strikingly different message from the prepared statement he had delivered on Monday, and a reversion to his initial response over the weekend. Speaking in the lobby of Trump Tower at what had been billed as a statement on infrastructure, a combative Trump defended his slowness to condemn white nationalists and neo-Nazis after the melee in central Virginia, which ended in the death of one woman and injuries to dozens of others, and compared the tearing down of Confederate monuments to the hypothetical removal of monuments to the Founding Fathers. He also said that counterprotesters deserve an equal amount of blame for the violence. “What about the alt-left that came charging at, as you say, at the alt-right?” Trump said. “Do they have any semblance of guilt?” “I’ve condemned neo-Nazis. I’ve condemned many different groups. But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me,” he said. “You had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists,” Trump said. “The press has treated them absolutely unfairly.” “You also had some very fine people on both sides,” he said. The Unite the Right rally that sparked the violence in Charlottesville featured several leading names in the white-nationalist alt-right movement, and also attracted people displaying Nazi symbols. As they walked down the street, the white-nationalist protesters chanted “blood and soil,” the English translation of a Nazi slogan. One of the men seen marching with the fascist group American Vanguard, James A. Fields, is charged with deliberately ramming a car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing 32-year-old counterprotester Heather Heyer. Trump on Tuesday made an explicit comparison between Confederate generals and Founding Fathers such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. “Many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee,” Trump said. “This week, it is Robert E. Lee. And I notice that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you have to ask yourself, where does it stop?” The substance of Trump’s unscripted remarks hewed more closely to his initial reaction to Charlottesville on Saturday, when he blamed “many sides” for what happened. On Monday, after two days of relentless criticism, Trump gave a stronger statement, saying “racism is evil” and specifically condemning white supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan, and neo-Nazis. Speaking to reporters shortly afterward, white nationalist Richard Spencer told reporters he didn’t see Trump’s remarks as a condemnation of his movement. Tuesday’s appearance made it even clearer that those words had been forced on the president. Throughout his campaign, he was reluctant to disavow the white nationalists who have formed a vocal segment of his supporters. Asked if he had spoken to Heyer’s family in the days since her death, Trump said “we will be reaching out.” Trump also addressed swirling rumors about the status of his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who has come in for another round of speculation this week that his job may be in danger. Trump is reportedly angry about the recent book Devil’s Bargain, by the Bloomberg Businessweek writer Joshua Green, which portrays Bannon as the key reason for Trump’s election victory. The president defended Bannon as having been unfairly attacked as a racist in the press, but declined to say if he still has confidence in him. “I like Mr. Bannon, he is a friend of mine,” Trump said. “But Mr. Bannon came on very late. You know that. I went through 17 senators, governors, and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that. I like him. He is a good man. He is not a racist, I can tell you that. He is a good person. He actually gets very unfair press in that regard. We’ll see what happens with Mr. Bannon. But he is a good person, and I think the press treats him, frankly, very unfairly.” The remarks echo what Trump told the New York Post  earlier this year during a similar moment of uncertainty about Bannon’s position. “I like Steve, but you have to remember he was not involved in my campaign until very late,” Trump told the Post in April.   \\nThe New York Times: Digital and Home Delivery Subscriptions\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Offer for a New York Times News subscription; current subscribers not eligible.

But that\\'s what happened on Saturday night, when Trump popped by to offer his congratulations and compliment the \"beautiful bride\" as the reception was winding down around 10:30 p.m. \"I had to run to the bathroom at one point in the night,\" Piatowski (now officially Kristen Gladhill) told me over phone this week. \"And when I heard the whole audience roaring, I knew it was happening.\" She washed her hands, dried them on her dress, and made her way back to the reception \"like a bat out of hell,\" telling the notably germ-averse Trump once she arrived, \"I promise this is just water—I just washed my hands!\"       Bride and groom Kristen and Tucker Gladhill with President Trump drewnoelphotography.com   For the three or four minutes that the president was in the room and took pictures with the couple, they say, \"it felt like time stood still.\" He\\'d been having dinner upstairs at the golf club. Never one to miss an opportunity to soak up some adoration—and reinforce his role as the de facto face of the Trump club network—the president met the couple in the club\\'s downstairs library.   It was not meant to be a political wedding by any means. —The bride   Trump wasn\\'t on the Greenhills\\' guest list, but they might have had an inkling he\\'d stop by. A now-discontinued wedding brochure for the club suggested that “If he is on-site for your big day, he will likely stop in & congratulate the happy couple. He may take some photos with you but we ask you and your guests to be respectful of his time & privacy.”        Trump stopped by his club’s library during the wedding festivities. drewnoelphotography.com   \"I can’t say it was something we dreamed about since we’ve been children,\" Tucker says of the president\\'s visit, \"but when we found out there was a possibility that he may make an appearance, there was a level of excitement.\" \"Regardless of my feelings personally or how we voted,\" the bride says, \"it’s an honor to have the person who’s running the free world come show up at our wedding.\" And despite cheers of \"USA! USA! USA!\" and \"Looking good, Donald!\" the bride insists it \"was not meant to be a political wedding by any means.\"       There was a double rainbow in Bedminster for the Gladhill wedding on Saturday. drewnoelphotography.com   It wasn\\'t their only Trump family sighting over the course of the weekend. The couple and their families rented houses on the property for the weekend, and Ivanka Trump and her family were around as well. In fact they ran into Ivanka at the pool with her children, and with Marine One landing and the Secret Service around, Kristen says she has \"never felt more safe in my whole life.\" This isn\\'t the first club wedding Trump has attended as president. In February he made an appearance at Vanessa Falk and Carl Lindner\\'s wedding at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, and he greeted the bride and groom on multiple occasions over the course of their weekend at the club. Unlike the Bedminster wedding, Trump was invited to that one. \"My parents have been members of Mar-a-Lago for years,\" says the bride, who recently moved from her native Nashville to Cincinnati, where her new husband\\'s father is co-CEO of insurance giant American Financial Group, Inc. \"We got his reply card and he wrote, \\'Will try to stop by if in town—Best Wishes,\" Falk Lindner says. About a week before the wedding, his attendance was confirmed. On Saturday morning February 11, after he returned to Mar-a-Lago from golfing with Japan\\'s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump saw the wedding party on the lawn and took the opportunity to pose for a photo with his characteristic thumbs-up pose.       President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pose with the Falk/Lindner wedding party at Mar-a-Lago in February. Kortnee Kate Photography   Trump recounted the experience when he addressed the crowd at the reception that evening: \"I know both families very, very well. One of them has been members of this club for a long time. They paid me a fortune,\" the president said. \"These are two great families. Perhaps, more importantly, this is a really beautiful couple. ... They\\'re going to have many, many years of love and success and everything that goes with it. I saw them out on the lawn today and I said to the prime minister of Japan, I said, \\'Shinzo, let\\'s go over and say hello. Look how beautiful they are.\\' So they have pictures, which are pretty good pictures, with the prime minister of Japan and the president.\" A video of the full speech, which has not been released until now, is below:     The Lindners chose Mar-a-Lago as their venue last August. \"We said to each other,\" Vanessa told me, \"\\'How cool would it be if Donald wins and he\\'s there?\\'\"  They know from experience that \"it\\'s not uncommon that he socializes with members when he is on-site,\" Vanessa says. \"He is always jovial and friendly.\"       Donald Trump’s reply card and guestbook message for the Lindners’ wedding Courtesy of Vanessa Falk Lindner   Their guests apparently loved Trump\\'s presence as much as they did. \"My father got on the microphone and said, \\'Everyone please take your seats, everyone remain calm,\\'\" Vanessa said. But \"instead of sitting down they were climbing on chairs and it turned into wild animals and everyone going nuts, including our parents\\' friends in their 60s and 70s,\" she says. Vanessa said that they had to make a few small changes to their plans once Trump\\'s attendance was confirmed, including moving a few events to other rooms at Mar-a-Lago to accommodate a request from the Secret Service, and changing the trolley schedule so that guests arriving from other hotels would have enough time to get through the club\\'s security checkpoints.  Those security checks are a requirement for anyone who wants to hobnob with the president, even the Far Hills Country Day School celebrating their eighth-grade graduation at Trump National in Bedminster on Friday night.  Trump crashed that party, too, and a parent at the party told the Bernardsville News   that \"even the students were \\'wanded\\' with metal detectors.\" The surprise visit from POTUS was worth it though; a grinning Trump posed for photographs with the roughly 35 students. The White House did not respond for a request for comment.

In an interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Trump put into words what many people have long been suspecting, that were it not for his mastery of hyperbole in 140 characters, he would not now be occupying the most powerful office on Earth. “Let me tell you about Twitter,” the president began. “I think that maybe I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for Twitter.” Lump together his followers on Twitter and Facebook, Instagram, @Potus and “lots of other things”, Trump said, and he has the combined ability to publish directly to as many as 100 million people. “Twitter is a wonderful thing for me, because I get the word out … I might not be here talking to you right now as president if I didn’t have an honest way of getting the word out.” Or “dishonest way”, he might have said. Many of his most memorable tweets have been demonstrable lies, such as his claim that millions of people voted illegally in the presidential election.    In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 \\n  Or his contention that global warming was a hoax invented by the Chinese.    The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 \\n  And then there was that little matter earlier this month in which Trump sparked a firestorm by claiming on Twitter, without producing any evidence, that President Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower.    How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 \\n  Carlson pressed Trump on his relaxed approach to accuracy on social media. “Why not wait to tweet about it until you can prove it? Don’t you devalue your words when you can’t provide evidence?” the Fox News host asked.  To which the president of the United States replied, slightly indignantly, that there had been evidence: he had read about wiretapping in the New York Times – “the failing New York Times” he corrected himself quickly, realizing he had just committed a faux pas by crediting one of his “dishonest media” enemies as a reliable source. Not only that, he hastened to add, he even heard Fox News’s own Bret Baier use the word. “If you watched the [sic] Bret Baier and what he was saying and what he was talking about and how he mentioned the word wiretap, you would feel very confident that you could mention the name.”   Who needs the combined might of the intelligence agencies – commanded, as it happens, by one President Trump – when you’ve got the “failing” New York Times and the Bret Baier to lean on? “And don’t forget,” Trump added, “when I say wiretapping, those words were in quotes. That really covers, because wiretapping is pretty old fashioned stuff, but that really covers surveillance and many other things. And nobody ever talks about the fact that it was in quotes, but that’s a very important thing.” But if the president says something that cannot be proved or is demonstrably untrue, doesn’t that devalue his own currency, Carlson asked a second time.  “Let’s see whether or not I proved it,” said the Twitter master. “I think we have some very good stuff. And we’re in the process of putting it together, and I think it’s going to be very demonstrative.”        Image source, AFP Image caption, Mr Trump (centre) jokes with Mr Lavrov (left) and Ambassador Sergei Kislyak      President Donald Trump revealed highly classified information about so-called Islamic State (IS) to Russia\\'s foreign minister, US media report.    The information, related to the use of laptops on aircraft, came from a partner of the US which had not given permission for it to be shared with Russia, says the Washington Post.   Mr Trump received Sergei Lavrov in the Oval Office last week.   National Security Adviser HR McMaster dismissed the reporting as \"false\".   The Trump campaign\\'s alleged links to Moscow have dogged his presidency and are part of several investigations.    But the president has dismissed such allegations as \"fake news\".   During the election campaign, Mr Trump repeatedly criticised his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, for how she handled sensitive material.    What actually happened?    In a conversation with the Russian foreign minister and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak in the Oval Office, the president revealed details that could lead to the exposure of a source of information, officials told the Washington Post and the New York Times.   The discussion was about an IS plot. The president reportedly went \"off-script\", revealing specifics of the plot, thought to centre on the use of laptop computers on aircraft, and the city from which that threat had been detected.    Image caption, Donald Trump was highly critical of Hillary Clinton on the issue during the election campaign     The intelligence disclosed came from a US ally and was considered too sensitive to share with other US allies, the papers report.   Others present realised the mistake and scrambled to \"contain the damage\" by informing the CIA and the National Security Agency (NSA), says the Post.   Mr Trump\\'s actions would not be illegal, as the US president has the authority to declassify information.   The meeting came a day after Mr Trump fired his FBI chief, James Comey, sparking criticism that he had done so because the FBI was investigating alleged Russian ties.    What has the White House said?    National Security Adviser HR McMaster told reporters that the story, \"as reported\", was \"false\".   \"The president and foreign minister reviewed a range of common threats to our two countries, including threats to civil aviation,\" he said.    Media caption, US National Security Adviser HR McMaster: \"I was in the room, it didn\\'t happen\"     \"At no time - at no time - were intelligence sources or methods discussed. And the president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known.\"   In a statement, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson echoed the point that \"the nature of specific threats were discussed, but they did not discuss sources, methods or military operations\".    The Washington Post, which first broke the story, said this did not amount to a denial.   Speaking to the BBC, reporter Greg Jaffe said the Post\\'s story made it clear the president did not disclose sources or methods.   But he added: \"Our story says that the nature of the information provided would have allowed the Russians to \\'reverse engineer\\' to discover the sources and methods. He said so much that they could figure it out.\"    On its website, the Washington Post said Mr McMaster \"seems to be saying that the thing that didn\\'t happen is something The Post never actually reported\".    Golden rule: Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent    Despite the denials issued by the White House that any actual intelligence sources were revealed to the Russians, whatever was said in that Oval Office meeting was enough to alarm certain officials and, reportedly, to alert the CIA and NSA.   They in turn will have needed to warn the country that supplied the intelligence. There is a golden rule in the world of espionage that when one government supplies intelligence to another it must not be passed on to a third party without permission of the original supplier. The reason is simple: it could put the lives of their human informants at risk.   In this case it appears to relate to the discovery of plans by jihadists in Syria to devise a way of smuggling viable explosive devices on board a plane inside a laptop computer. Given the well-publicised ban on laptops in cabins on certain Middle Eastern routes, whoever revealed that information is unlikely to be still in place.    Levels of US classification - from lowest to highest      Confidential: Information that reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security if disclosed to unauthorised sources.

Administered by the CIA. The material discussed by Mr Trump with the Russians was under a codeword, sources told the Washington Post     What has the reaction been?    The Senate\\'s second-highest ranked Democrat, Dick Durbin, said Mr Trump\\'s actions appeared to be \"dangerous\" and reckless\".   A spokesman for Paul Ryan, Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, said: \"We have no way to know what was said, but protecting our nation\\'s secrets is paramount.   \"The speaker hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration.\"    The Republican head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, said the story was \"very, very troubling\" if true.   \"Obviously they\\'re in a downward spiral right now and they\\'ve got to figure out a way to come to grips\" with it, he told Bloomberg.     More on this story        The president says he recently read a book about Andrew Jackson.    &#151; -- Donald Trump, bookworm in chief? Not quite, but the president says he does \"love to read,\" even though the demands of being commander in chief don\\'t allow for much downtime. In an excerpt from an interview with Fox News\\' Tucker Carlson that aired Thursday night, President Trump is asked, \"What do you do at the end of the day? What do you read, what do you watch?\" \"Well, you know, I love to read,\" Trump said. \"Actually, I\\'m looking at a book, I\\'m reading a book, I\\'m trying to get started. Every time I do about a half a page, I get a phone call that there\\'s some emergency, this or that. But we\\'re going to see the home of Andrew Jackson today in Tennessee and I\\'m reading a book on Andrew Jackson.\" Trump added, \"I love to read. I don\\'t get to read very much, Tucker, because I\\'m working very hard on lots of different things, including getting costs down. The costs of our country are out of control. But we have a lot of great things happening, we have a lot of tremendous things happening.\" Trump has authored close to 20 bestsellers, including his first book, 1987\\'s \"The Art of a Deal.\" His other books include \"How to Get Rich,\" \"Think Like a Billionaire,\" \"The America We Deserve,\" and \"Think Like a Champion.\"       In preparation for their White House visits, both Japanese and German officials studied the infamous feature for clues into the president’s thinking on world affairs.      Joshua Roberts / Reuters      To understand the thinking of American presidents, historians, contemporaries, and political rivals, have often sought out the texts that most influenced them. George Washington, for example, was known to love Cato: A Tragedy, Joseph Addison’s civics-heavy play about the man who tried and failed to block Caesar’s path to tyranny. He loved the play so much that he forced demoralized troops at Valley Forge to view a staging of it. Calvin Coolidge was apparently so enamored of Cicero that he nearly became fluent in Latin after regularly reading him. Herbert Hoover, who grew up poor and became insanely wealthy, was, unsurprisingly, a big fan of Dickens’ David Copperfield. For President Donald Trump, one such Rosetta stone seems to be Norman Vincent Peale’s  The Power of Positive Thinking . But another key text is an interview  he himself gave to Playboy magazine in 1990, when he was but a mere real-estate mogul and New York institution. The interview, at turns eerie and prophetic, runs through his typically immodest self-assessment and catalogues his political philosophies, while offering a scathing appraisal of America, which he saw (and still sees) as “weak” and “pushed around” by the rest of the world. In the interview, he also unfurls a blueprint for his hypothetical presidency, years before winning the White House. In recent months, at least two world leaders have shared the interview with their staffs in advance of their first meetings with the president. According to The Wall Street Journal, Japanese officials revisited it ahead of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit last month; German Chancellor Angela Merkel also studied it before arriving in the United States this week, several sources say. Beyond the standard self-aggrandizement and hagiography of Trump’s own business deals, what makes the Playboy interview instructive reading for foreign eyes is how, with greater depth than many of his campaign soundbites, the future president prioritizes America’s trade partnerships. In response to a question about the first thing a hypothetical President Trump would do, Trump says, “Many things. A toughness of attitude would prevail. I’d throw a tax on every Mercedes-Benz rolling into this country and on all Japanese products, and we’d have wonderful allies again.” With Trump’s long-held passion for taxing German luxury cars likely on Merkel’s mind, then, it’s perhaps unsurprising that\\xa0 Harald Krueger, the CEO of BMW, was among the German business leaders she brought along on her White House visit on Friday. As Automotive News notes, the German automaker’s largest production factory is in South Carolina. Merkel is keenly interested in whatever plans Trump has for German autos. One of the more notable recurrent themes in the Playboy interview is Trump’s fixation on Japan, whose economic clout at the time was, in his words, enabled by “openly screwing us.” He laments how U.S. military ships helped safeguard oil shipments traveling from the Persian Gulf to Japan, only to be used to compete against American auto companies. “We’re losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year while they laugh at our stupidity,” he says. In the following years, with Japan’s financial standing undercut by a recession and its often-debated “lost decades,” it’s easy to see how present-day Trump has come to view China and Mexico as stand-ins for Japan on matters like free trade and the need for tariffs. Trade deals like NAFTA, despite their mixed results, offer him a more direct way of critiquing American economic policies. Also reminiscent of current-day Trump is 1990-Trump’s emphasis on American strength in foreign policy. Talking about the Cold War and Iran, Trump lamented that, “Some of our presidents have been incredible jerk-offs,” and reiterated several times that “we need to be tough.” In classic fashion, Trump also assesses himself, along with Mother Teresa, Jesus Christ, and the Pope, as successful people with “far greater egos than you will ever understand.” The future president transposes the need for this personal ideology into a national imperative and, once again, directs his rage more at America’s friends than its enemies.   I think our country needs more ego, because it is being ripped off so badly by our so-called allies; i.e., Japan, West Germany, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, etc. They have literally outegotized this country, because they rule the greatest money machine ever assembled and it’s sitting on our backs. Their products are better because they have so much subsidy. We Americans are laughed at around the world for losing a hundred and fifty billion dollars year after year, for defending wealthy nations for nothing, nations that would be wiped off the face of the earth in about fifteen minutes if it weren’t for us. Our “allies” are making billions screwing us.   In other remarks that would echo his language today, Trump explains how a future President Trump would handle military matters. “He would believe very strongly in extreme military strength,” Trump says. “He wouldn’t trust anyone … he wouldn’t trust our allies; he’d have a huge military arsenal, perfect it, understand it. Part of the problem is that we’re defending some of the wealthiest countries in the world for nothing.” Though it hardly took an old interview to predict it, in Trump’s joint press conference with Merkel on Friday afternoon, he pressed Germany to fulfill its financial commitments to NATO. “Many nations owe vast sums of money from past years, and it is very unfair to the United States,” Trump said. Merkel, for her part, seemed to extract some of what she hoped for—Trump distanced himself from “an isolationist policy” and reiterated his “strong support” for NATO. Despite the customary characterizations of Trump as the consummate wildcard, the president—then and now—has shown himself to be remarkably consistent, predictable even. Though the tenor and venue of his 1990 interview may be unconventional, a look back at Trump’s own words seems to show that he has a core set of principles to which he is quite committed.       President Trump signs an executive order aimed at easing an IRS rule limiting political activity for churches during a National Day of Prayer event in the Rose Garden of the White House on May 4. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)   Donald Trump was a billionaire developer entranced with televangelists when he tuned into a show featuring a Florida preacher who used the Bible to offer business tips. He was so impressed that he called her up. “You’ve got the ‘It’ factor,” Paula White recalled Trump telling her, and he invited her to come visit him in New York. This spring, President Trump called on White again to help arrange a White House dinner for 40 evangelical leaders before the National Day of Prayer. White invited some seasoned operatives of the Christian right and other religious leaders she thought Trump would click with — entrepreneurs, entertainers and believers in the prosperity gospel, which emphasizes financial success and is widely rejected by mainstream evangelicals. On that relaxed early May evening in the Blue Room, their differences did not seem to matter. “It felt like a family dinner,” White recently recalled. Trump has sought counsel from evangelical voices since the campaign, when White led an advisory group of about two dozen preachers. The president has been criticized for giving conservative Christian groups unusual access, hearing their views on everything from sex trafficking to prison restructuring. They scored victories with the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch and with Trump’s decision to impose contraception coverage limits under the Affordable Care Act. Now, some of the advisers say, Trump intends to establish an official presidential faith initiative, more along the lines of the office created by President George W. Bush and continued under the Obama administration, which would formalize White House relationships with a broader variety of religious groups. Frank Page, president of the Southern Baptist Convention executive committee, said Trump had benefited from evangelical support and recognized he could build on that momentum “as any good politician would.” The timeline for the effort is uncertain, and the White House declined to comment. Johnnie Moore, the evangelical group’s coordinator, described it as “a moving target.” Moore said some pastors who took Trump’s personal cellphone number during the campaign now have the White House on “speed dial.” An unlikely alliance Trump’s early alliance with evangelicals did not seem like a natural fit. Several said Trump’s multiple marriages, tabloid lifestyle and intemperate tweeting made them reluctant to meet him. But throughout his career, Trump drew upon lessons taught by Norman Vincent Peale, the pastor at his boyhood church who preached the “power of positive thinking.” Trump’s fascination with Christian broadcasting dates back at least to the start of his own foray into the entertainment business in 2004 with the launch of “The Apprentice.” As ratings for his reality show soared, Trump jetted off to give speeches, filling convention halls with crowds eager to hear his vision for personal success. Trump seemed to adopt some of the televangelists’ speaking strategies, using a soothing cadence that builds to a roar. “It was like a cult,” recalled Jim Dowd, who sometimes traveled with Trump. “I was awestruck to see him go up on the podium with no script and to be able to deliver his sermon — Trumpology,” Dowd recalled in a 2015 interview. Dowd, who died in 2016, worked on publicity for the show before starting his own company, with Trump as a client. Trump also reached out to pastors with influential — and often lucrative — TV ministries. Dallas pastor Robert Jeffress described in an interview how Trump called after seeing him on Fox News. In 2013, Trump stopped by Madison Square Garden to hear San Diego megachurch pastor and TV personality David Jeremiah as he launched his new annotated Bible. Trump\\'s name was floated among evangelicals as a possible presidential candidate as early as 2011, when Christiane Amanpour interviewed Franklin Graham, Billy Graham\\'s son and chief executive of a Christian relief group. “She asked me about [Trump] on camera,” Graham said in an interview. “He called me. He just thanked me for the nice things I said.” Moore, then a vice president at Liberty University, a private Christian university in Lynchburg, Va., invited Trump to speak to students at a 2012 convocation. Trump called himself \"a Christian, and a very proud Christian and a real Christian,\" telling students that they, too, could all be \"winners.\" As Trump wound up, Jerry Falwell, Jr., Liberty’s president, joined him onstage and asked, “It’s not too late to get back into the presidential race, is it?” Four years later, when Trump trained his sights on the White House, he arranged a New York meeting in June 2016 to hear the concerns of evangelicals, inviting many of the pastors he had admired on television. “He was recognizing faces. That was a treat,” said Mark Burns, co-founder of the NOW Television Network, which does Christian programming. Jentezen Franklin, pastor of a Georgia megachurch, said Trump recalled Norman Vincent Peale’s influence on his early life. “[Trump] remembered as a kid sitting there and listening to what a great orator [Peale] was,” Franklin recalled. Trump also shared a political observation about the evangelical world. “I don’t get you guys,” Franklin recalled Trump saying. “You’ve got the biggest voting bloc, and you guys don’t get together for nothing.” About one-third of the members of the informal advisory group White helped assemble are from the burgeoning Pentecostal or charismatic movements, which take an emotional rather than intellectual approach to worship. Some have promoted controversial messages such as the prosperity gospel, which encourages abundant giving to religious causes and teaches that God blesses the faithful with health and wealth. They “would have been excluded” from previous administrations’ faith groups, said Page, who also served on President Barack Obama’s faith council where the focus, he said, was on “major mainline faith groups.” Among them are independent Internet-era televangelists such as White, whose marketing reach has been magnified by social media, podcasts and live-streaming. In their meetings, where the pastors have hammered out stances on issues such as criminal justice and immigration, they say their doctrinal differences scarcely surface. Burns, whose prominence has soared since he became a Trump campaign surrogate, described in an interview why he thinks the prosperity gospel’s message is key to overcoming political challenges such as social and racial inequalities. “The way to destroy issues dealing with the color of skin is to overshadow it with the color of green,” said Burns, who is African American. “Money. Money. Prosperity!” The advisers also say they have come to know a more reflective, curious Trump in private than the boastful public persona familiar from tweets and TV speeches. White, who rarely gives interviews, said she has seen Trump’s spiritual side and regularly prays with him. Trump was confirmed a Presbyterian, White said, and “clearly understands salvation and clearly calls himself a believer and a Christian.” “Was there a point in time when our president prayed and received the Lord as his savior? Yes,” White said. Broadening the effort Trump’s evangelical alliance has not been totally smooth. Ed Stetzer, who holds the Billy Graham Chair of Church, Mission, and Evangelism at Wheaton College, said he declined to join Trump’s original advisory group. “I don’t know that it was helpful for what God was calling me to do,” he said. Two members left in the wake of public outcries about Trump’s behavior. Chicago-area megachurch pastor James MacDonald resigned before the election, describing Trump as “lecherous and worthless” in a letter to the other members after tapes were released showing Trump bragging about grabbing women’s genitals. New York megachurch pastor A.R. Bernard quit over Trump’s handling of the white supremacist riots in Charlottesville. In an interview, Bernard decried Trump’s lack of “moral compass.” Some see a Faustian bargain in the ongoing willingness of some of the religious leaders to turn a blind eye to Trump\\'s flaws. \"We must conclude theirs is not just blindness, but a willful blindness to their own seduction,\" said Richard Cizik, president of the New Evangelical Partnership for the Common Good. But James Robison, a televangelist and founder of the inspirational website The Stream, said he has advised the president privately on spiritual matters and described Trump in an interview as \"a man who is trying to learn how to love God.\"   Critics of Trump’s evangelical board do not all say that creating a formal faith initiative will necessarily broaden the range of views that Trump hears. “Trump may bring people together who appear to be religiously diverse but are politically monolithic,” said Christopher Leighton, founding director of the Institute for Islamic, Christian & Jewish Studies. The Jewish tradition shows that the best teachers are often people we disagree with, he said. But Trump, he said, may pick leaders who put politics first: “Trump will bring in Orthodox Jews or conservative Roman Catholics who will line up and be willing to place their political loyalties over a broader concern for the integrity and coherence of their theological traditions.” Board members of any new faith outreach program will have to ask themselves the question that is hanging over the president’s evangelical advisers, Stetzer said: “Is it helpful or hurtful to be this close to President Trump?”   Years ago, while reporting a book about a real-estate developer and reality-TV star named Donald Trump,  Tim O’Brien  accompanied his subject on a private jet ride to Los Angeles. The plane, as you can imagine, was overly ornate; hanging on one wall, for instance, was a painting of two young girls—one in an orange hat, the other wearing a floral bonnet—in the impressionistic style of Renoir. Curious, O’Brien asked Trump about the painting: was it an original Renoir? Trump replied in the affirmative. It was, he said. “No, it’s not Donald,” O’Brien responded. But, once again, Trump protested that it was. “Donald, it’s not,” O’Brien said adamantly. “I grew up in Chicago, that Renoir is called Two Sisters on the Terrace, and it’s hanging on a wall at the Art Institute of Chicago.” He concluded emphatically: “That’s not an original.” Trump, of course, did not agree, but O’Brien dropped the conversation topic and moved on with his interview. He thought that he had heard the last of the Renoir conversation. But the next day, when they boarded the plane to head back to New York City, Trump again pointed to the painting, and as if the conversation had never happened, he pointed to the fake and proclaimed, “You know, that’s an original Renoir.” O’Brien chose not to engage, and dropped the conversation.   Years went by. O’Brien wrote an explosive book, titled  TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald , which noted that Trump was not actually a multi-billionaire, but rather worth about $150 to $250 million. Trump didn’t like being labeled a measly millionaire, so he sued O’Brien for “malice,” and lost. More time went on, Trump sold the jet, and traded-up to a larger plane; O’Brien assumed that the fake Renoir had been tossed into a bonfire, or at least a proverbial one. And that was the end of the story. Then, in 2016, the unimaginable happened: Trump was elected president of the United States. A few days afterward, Trump sat down with 60 Minutes for one of his first interviews as president-elect. O’Brien was watching the interview, which took place in Trump Tower. It was highly choreographed, with cameras set up precisely where Trump wanted them. O’Brien watched Trump seated in an ugly mini-throne—“the kind of furniture Trump loves,” O’Brien notes—and sure enough, in the background, hanging on a wall, was that fake Renoir. “I’m sure he’s still telling people who come into the apartment, ‘It’s an original, it’s an original,’” O’Brien told me on this week’s Inside the Hive podcast. While this story is comical and sad and utterly bizarre on so many levels, it’s also emblematic of Trump’s very essence. “He believes his own lies in a way that lasts for decades,” O’Brien told me. “He’ll tell the same stories time and time again, regardless of whether or not facts are right in front of his face.” And, as O’Brien points out, that’s what makes Trump so dangerous in his current war with the media around so-called fake news. “Its foundation is that he’s the final arbiter of what is true and what isn’t,” O’Brien said, “and it’s one of the reasons that he’s so dangerous.”   &#151; -- President Donald Trump suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin would have been happier if Hillary Clinton had won the election, according to a press release for an interview with Pat Robertson for \"The 700 Club,\" which will air in full Thursday morning. \"We are the most powerful country in the world, and we are getting more and more powerful because I\\'m a big military person. As an example, if Hillary had won, our military would be decimated. Our energy would be much more expensive. That\\'s what Putin doesn\\'t like about me. And that\\'s why I say, why would he want me? Because from Day One, I wanted a strong military. He doesn\\'t want to see that,\" Trump said, according to the press release. \"And from Day One, I want fracking and everything else to get energy prices low and to create tremendous energy. We\\'re going to be self-supporting. We just about are now. We\\'re going to be exporting energy. He doesn\\'t want that. He would like Hillary, where she wants to have windmills. He would much rather have that because energy prices would go up and Russia, as you know, relies very much on energy,\" Trump added, according to the press release. \"There are many things that I would do that are the exact opposite of what he would want,\" Trump said. A video clip from the interview centered on talk about the recent G-20 summit, with Trump speaking highly of his relationships with other world leaders and touting the cease-fire deal in Syria that he and Putin reached. \"We had a good meeting,\" Trump said of his meeting with Putin. \"I think we had an excellent meeting. One thing we did is we have a cease-fire in a major part of Syria where there was tremendous bedlam and tremendous killing. And by the way, this cease-fire has held for four days — those cease-fires haven\\'t held at all. That\\'s because President Putin and President Trump made the deal.\" Trump said it\\'s \"important\" to have an open dialogue with all countries and saw the summit as a good way of helping build those relationships. \"It was a great G-20. We had 20 countries. I get along — I think really fantastically — with the head of every country,\" he said. According to the press release, the interview covered other issues as well, such as Trump\\'s expectation that the Senate will pass the GOP\\'s health care reform bill. \"I am sitting in the Oval Office with a pen in hand, waiting for our senators to give it to me,\" he said.        In 1984, a Russian émigré named David Bogatin went shopping for apartments in New York City. The 38-year-old had arrived in America seven years before, with just $3 in his pocket. But for a former pilot in the Soviet Army—his specialty had been shooting down Americans over North Vietnam—he had clearly done quite well for himself. Bogatin wasn’t hunting for a place in Brighton Beach, the Brooklyn enclave known as “Little Odessa” for its large population of immigrants from the Soviet Union. Instead, he was fixated on the glitziest apartment building on Fifth Avenue, a gaudy, 58-story edifice with gold-plated fixtures and a pink-marble atrium: Trump Tower. A monument to celebrity and conspicuous consumption, the tower was home to the likes of Johnny Carson, Steven Spielberg, and Sophia Loren. Its brash, 38-year-old developer was something of a tabloid celebrity himself. Donald Trump was just coming into his own as a serious player in Manhattan real estate, and Trump Tower was the crown jewel of his growing empire. From the day it opened, the building was a hit—all but a few dozen of its 263 units had sold in the first few months. But Bogatin wasn’t deterred by the limited availability or the sky-high prices. The Russian plunked down $6 million to buy not one or two, but five luxury condos. The big check apparently caught the attention of the owner. According to Wayne Barrett, who investigated the deal for the Village Voice, Trump personally attended the closing, along with Bogatin.   If the transaction seemed suspicious—multiple apartments for a single buyer who appeared to have no legitimate way to put his hands on that much money—there may have been a reason. At the time, Russian mobsters were beginning to invest in high-end real estate, which offered an ideal vehicle to launder money from their criminal enterprises. “During the ’80s and ’90s, we in the U.S. government repeatedly saw a pattern by which criminals would use condos and high-rises to launder money,” says Jonathan Winer, a deputy assistant secretary of state for international law enforcement in the Clinton administration. “It didn’t matter that you paid too much, because the real estate values would rise, and it was a way of turning dirty money into clean money. It was done very systematically, and it explained why there are so many high-rises where the units were sold but no one is living in them.” When Trump Tower was built, as David Cay Johnston  reports in The Making of Donald Trump, it was only the second high-rise in New York that accepted anonymous buyers.   In 1987, just three years after he attended the closing with Trump, Bogatin pleaded guilty to taking part in a massive gasoline-bootlegging scheme with Russian mobsters. After he fled the country, the government seized his five condos at Trump Tower, saying that he had purchased them to “launder money, to shelter and hide assets.” A Senate investigation into organized crime later revealed that Bogatin was a leading figure in the Russian mob in New York. His family ties, in fact, led straight to the top: His brother ran a $150 million stock scam with none other than Semion Mogilevich, whom the FBI considers the “boss of bosses” of the Russian mafia. At the time, Mogilevich—feared even by his fellow gangsters as “the most powerful mobster in the world”—was expanding his multibillion-dollar international criminal syndicate into America.   In 1987, on his first trip to Russia, Trump visited the Winter Palace with Ivana. The Soviets flew him to Moscow—all expenses paid—to discuss building a luxury hotel across from the Kremlin.Maxim Blokhin/TASS  Since Trump’s election as president, his ties to Russia have become the focus of intense scrutiny, most of which has centered on whether his inner circle colluded with Russia to subvert the U.S. election. A growing chorus in Congress is also asking pointed questions about how the president built his business empire. Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, has called for a deeper inquiry into “Russian investment in Trump’s businesses and properties.”   The very nature of Trump’s businesses—all of which are privately held, with few reporting requirements—makes it difficult to root out the truth about his financial deals. And the world of Russian oligarchs and organized crime, by design, is shadowy and labyrinthine. For the past three decades, state and federal investigators, as well as some of America’s best investigative journalists, have sifted through mountains of real estate records, tax filings, civil lawsuits, criminal cases, and FBI and Interpol reports, unearthing ties between Trump and Russian mobsters like Mogilevich. To date, no one has documented that Trump was even aware of any suspicious entanglements in his far-flung businesses, let alone that he was directly compromised by the Russian mafia or the corrupt oligarchs who are closely allied with the Kremlin. So far, when it comes to Trump’s ties to Russia, there is no smoking gun.   But even without an investigation by Congress or a special prosecutor, there is much we already know about the president’s debt to Russia. A review of the public record reveals a clear and disturbing pattern: Trump owes much of his business success, and by extension his presidency, to a flow of highly suspicious money from Russia. Over the past three decades, at least 13 people with known or alleged links to Russian mobsters or oligarchs have owned, lived in, and even run criminal activities out of Trump Tower and other Trump properties. Many used his apartments and casinos to launder untold millions in dirty money. Some ran a worldwide high-stakes gambling ring out of Trump Tower—in a unit directly below one owned by Trump. Others provided Trump with lucrative branding deals that required no investment on his part. Taken together, the flow of money from Russia provided Trump with a crucial infusion of financing that helped rescue his empire from ruin, burnish his image, and launch his career in television and politics. “They saved his bacon,” says Kenneth McCallion, a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Reagan administration who investigated ties between organized crime and Trump’s developments in the 1980s. It’s entirely possible that Trump was never more than a convenient patsy for Russian oligarchs and mobsters, with his casinos and condos providing easy pass-throughs for their illicit riches. At the very least, with his constant need for new infusions of cash and his well-documented troubles with creditors, Trump made an easy “mark” for anyone looking to launder money. But whatever his knowledge about the source of his wealth, the public record makes clear that Trump built his business empire in no small part with a lot of dirty money from a lot of dirty Russians—including the dirtiest and most feared of them all.    Trump made his first trip to Russia in 1987, only a few years before the collapse of the Soviet Union. Invited by Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin, Trump was flown to Moscow and Leningrad—all expenses paid—to talk business with high-ups in the Soviet command. In The Art of the Deal, Trump recounted the lunch meeting with Dubinin that led to the trip. “One thing led to another,” he wrote, “and now I’m talking about building a large luxury hotel, across the street from the Kremlin, in partnership with the Soviet government.” Over the years, Trump and his sons would try and fail  five times to build a new Trump Tower in Moscow. But for Trump, what mattered most were the lucrative connections he had begun to make with the Kremlin—and with the wealthy Russians who would buy so many of his properties in the years to come. “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross section of a lot of our assets,” Donald Trump Jr. boasted  at a real estate conference in 2008. “We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.” The money, illicit and otherwise, began to rain in earnest after the Soviet Union fell in 1991. President Boris Yeltsin’s shift to a market economy was so abrupt that cash-rich gangsters and corrupt government officials were able to privatize and loot state-held assets in oil, coal, minerals, and banking. Yeltsin himself, in fact, would later describe Russia as “the biggest mafia state in the world.” After Vladimir Putin succeeded Yeltsin as president, Russian intelligence effectively joined forces with the country’s mobsters and oligarchs, allowing them to operate freely as long as they strengthen Putin’s power and serve his personal financial interests. According to James Henry, a former chief economist at McKinsey & Company who consulted on the Panama Papers, some $1.3 trillion in illicit capital has poured out of Russia since the 1990s.     Semion Mogilevich.   At the top of the sprawling criminal enterprise was Semion Mogilevich. Beginning in the early 1980s, according to the FBI, the short, squat Ukrainian was the key money-laundering contact for the Solntsevskaya Bratva, or Brotherhood, one of the richest criminal syndicates in the world. Before long, he was running a multibillion-dollar worldwide racket of his own. Mogilevich wasn’t feared because he was the most violent gangster, but because he was reputedly the smartest. The FBI has credited  the “brainy don,” who holds a degree in economics from Lviv University, with a staggering range of crimes. He ran drug trafficking and prostitution rings on an international scale; in one characteristic deal, he bought a bankrupt airline to ship heroin from Southeast Asia into Europe. He used a jewelry business in Moscow and Budapest as a front for art that Russian gangsters stole from museums, churches, and synagogues all over Europe. He has also been accused of selling some $20 million in stolen weapons, including ground-to-air missiles and armored troop carriers, to Iran. “He uses this wealth and power to not only further his criminal enterprises,” the FBI says, “but to influence governments and their economies.” In Russia, Mogilevich’s influence reportedly reaches all the way to the top. In 2005, Alexander Litvinenko, a Russian intelligence agent who defected to London, recorded an interview with investigators detailing his inside knowledge of the Kremlin’s ties to organized crime.  “Mogilevich,” he said in broken English, “have good relationship with Putin since 1994 or 1993.” A year later Litvinenko was dead, apparently poisoned by agents of the Kremlin.    Vyachelsav Ivankov.Sergey Ponomarev/AP  Mogilevich’s greatest talent, the one that places him at the top of the Russian mob, is finding creative ways to cleanse dirty cash. According to the FBI, he has laundered money through more than 100 front companies around the world, and held bank accounts in at least 27 countries. And in 1991, he made a move that led directly to Trump Tower. That year, the FBI says, Mogilevich paid a Russian judge to spring a fellow mob boss, Vyachelsav Kirillovich Ivankov, from a Siberian gulag. If Mogilevich was the brains, Ivankov was the enforcer—a vor v zakone, or “made man,” infamous for torturing his victims and boasting about the murders he had arranged. Sprung by Mogilevich, Ivankov made the most of his freedom. In 1992, a year after he was released from prison, he headed to New York on an illegal business visa and proceeded to set up shop in Brighton Beach.   In Red Mafiya, his book about the rise of the Russian mob in America,  investigative reporter Robert I. Friedman documented how Ivankov organized a lurid and violent underworld of tattooed gangsters. When Ivankov touched down at JFK, Friedman reported, he was met by a fellow vor, who handed him a suitcase with $1.5 million in cash. Over the next three years, Ivankov oversaw the mob’s growth from a local extortion racket to a multibillion-dollar criminal enterprise. According to the FBI, he recruited two “combat brigades” of Special Forces veterans from the Soviet war in Afghanistan to run the mafia’s protection racket and kill his enemies. Like Mogilevich, Ivankov had a lot of dirty money he needed to clean up. He bought a Rolls-Royce dealership that was used, according to The New York Times, “as a front to launder criminal proceeds.” The FBI concluded that one of Ivankov’s partners in the operation was Felix Komarov, an upscale art dealer who lived in Trump Plaza on Third Avenue. Komarov, who was not charged in the case, called the allegations baseless. He acknowledged that he had frequent phone conversations with Ivankov, but insisted the exchanges were innocent. “I had no reason not to call him,” Komarov told a reporter. The feds wanted to arrest Ivankov, but he kept vanishing. “He was like a ghost to the FBI,” one agent recalls. Agents spotted him meeting with other Russian crime figures in Miami, Los Angeles, Boston, and Toronto. They also found he made frequent visits to Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, which mobsters routinely used to launder huge sums of money. In 2015, the Taj Mahal was fined $10 million—the highest penalty ever levied by the feds against a casino—and admitted to having “willfully violated” anti-money-laundering regulations for years.   The FBI also struggled to figure out where Ivankov lived. “We were looking around, looking around, looking around,” James Moody, chief of the bureau’s organized crime section, told Friedman. “We had to go out and really beat the bushes. And then we found out that he was living in a luxury condo in Trump Tower.” There is no evidence that Trump knew Ivankov personally, even if they were neighbors. But the fact that a top Russian mafia boss lived and worked in Trump’s own building indicates just how much high-level Russian mobsters came to view the future president’s properties as a home away from home. In 2009, after being extradited to Russia to face murder charges, Ivankov was gunned down in a sniper attack on the streets of Moscow. According to The Moscow Times, his funeral was a media spectacle in Russia, attracting “1,000 people wearing black leather jackets, sunglasses, and gold chains,” along with dozens of giant wreaths from the various brotherhoods.  Throughout the 1990s, untold millions from the former Soviet Union flowed into Trump’s luxury developments and Atlantic City casinos. But all the money wasn’t enough to save Trump from his own failings as a businessman. He owed $4 billion to more than 70 banks, with a mind-boggling $800 million of it personally guaranteed. He spent much of the decade mired in litigation, filing for multiple bankruptcies and scrambling to survive. For most developers, the situation would have spelled financial ruin. But fortunately for Trump, his own economic crisis coincided with one in Russia.   In 1998, Russia defaulted on $40 billion in debt, causing the ruble to plummet and Russian banks to close. The ensuing financial panic sent the country’s oligarchs and mobsters scrambling to find a safe place to put their money. That October, just two months after the Russian economy went into a tailspin, Trump broke ground on his biggest project yet. Rising to 72 stories in midtown Manhattan, Trump World Tower would be the tallest residential building on the planet. Construction got underway in 1999—just as Trump was preparing his first run for the presidency on the Reform Party ticket— and concluded in 2001. As Bloomberg Businessweek reported earlier this year, it wasn’t long before one-third of the units on the tower’s priciest floors had been snatched up—either by individual buyers from the former Soviet Union, or by limited liability companies connected to Russia. “We had big buyers from Russia and Ukraine and Kazakhstan,” sales agent Debra Stotts told Bloomberg.    Sunny Isles, Florida, became known as “Little Moscow,” thanks to Trump’s high-rises.Rhona Wise/AFP/Getty  Among the new tenants was Eduard Nektalov, a diamond dealer from Uzbekistan. Nektalov, who was being investigated by a Treasury Department task force for mob-connected money laundering, bought a condo on the seventy-ninth floor, directly below Trump’s future campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway. A month later he sold his unit for a $500,000 profit. The following year, after rumors circulated that Nektalov was cooperating with federal investigators, he was shot down on Sixth Avenue. Trump had found his market. After Trump World Tower opened, Sotheby’s International Realty teamed up with a Russian real estate company to make a big sales push for the property in Russia. The “tower full of oligarchs,” as Bloomberg called it, became a model for Trump’s projects going forward. All he needed to do, it seemed, was slap the Trump name on a big building, and high-dollar customers from Russia and the former Soviet republics were guaranteed to come rushing in. Dolly Lenz, a New York real estate broker, told USA Today that she sold some 65 units in Trump World Tower to Russians. “I had contacts in Moscow looking to invest in the United States,” Lenz said. “They all wanted to meet Donald.”   To capitalize on his new business model, Trump struck a deal with a Florida developer to attach his name to six high-rises in Sunny Isles, just outside Miami. Without having to put up a dime of his own money, Trump would receive a cut of the profits. “Russians love the Trump brand,” Gil Dezer, the Sunny Isles developer, told Bloomberg. A local broker told The Washington Post that one-third of the 500 apartments he’d sold went to “Russian-speakers.” So many bought the Trump-branded apartments, in fact, that the area became known as “Little Moscow.”   “Russians love the Trump brand,” said developer Gil Dezer, (left, with Trump). One Florida tenant, Anatoly Golubchik (right) was busted in a major money-laundering ring run out of Trump Tower. Billy Farrell/Patrick McMullan/Getty; John Marshall Mantel/ New York Times/Redux  Many of the units were sold by a native of Uzbekistan who had immigrated from the Soviet Union in the 1980s; her business was so brisk that she soon began bringing Russian tour groups to Sunny Isles to view the properties. According to a Reuters investigation in March, at least 63 buyers with Russian addresses or passports spent $98 million on Trump’s properties in south Florida. What’s more, another one-third of the units—more than 700 in all—were bought by shadowy shell companies that concealed the true owners. Trump promoted and celebrated the properties. His organization continues to advertise the units; in 2011, when they first turned a profit, he attended a ceremonial mortgage-burning in Sunny Isles to toast their success. Last October, an investigation by the Miami Herald found that at least 13 buyers in the Florida complex have been the target of government investigations, either personally or through their companies, including “members of a Russian-American organized crime group.” Two buyers in Sunny Isles, Anatoly Golubchik and Michael Sall, were convicted for taking part in a massive international gambling and money-laundering syndicate that was run out of Trump Tower in New York. The ring, according to the FBI, was operating under the protection of the Russian mafia.    The influx of Russian money did more than save Trump’s business from ruin—it set the stage for the next phase of his career. By 2004, to the outside world, it appeared that Trump was back on top after his failures in Atlantic City. That January, flush with the appearance of success, Trump launched his newly burnished brand into another medium. “My name’s Donald Trump,” he declared in his opening narration for The Apprentice, “the largest real estate developer in New York. I own buildings all over the place. Model agencies. The Miss Universe pageant. Jetliners, golf courses, casinos, and private resorts like Mar-a-Lago, one of the most spectacular estates anywhere in the world.” But it wouldn’t be Trump without a better story than that. “It wasn’t always so easy,” he confessed, over images of him cruising around New York in a stretch limo. “About 13 years ago, I was seriously in trouble. I was billions of dollars in debt. But I fought back, and I won. Big league. I used my brain. I used my negotiating skills. And I worked it all out. Now my company’s bigger than it ever was and stronger than it ever was.… I’ve mastered the art of the deal.”   The show, which reportedly paid Trump up to $3 million per episode, instantly revived his career. “The Apprentice turned Trump from a blowhard Richie Rich who had just gone through his most difficult decade into an unlikely symbol of straight talk, an evangelist for the American gospel of success, a decider who insisted on standards in a country that had somehow slipped into handing out trophies for just showing up,” journalists  Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher observe in their book Trump Revealed. “Above all, Apprentice sold an image of the host-boss as supremely competent and confident, dispensing his authority and getting immediate results. The analogy to politics was palpable.” But the story of Donald Trump, self-made business genius, left out any mention of the shady Russian investors who had done so much to make his comeback narrative possible. And Trump’s business, despite the hype, was hardly “stronger than it ever was”—his credit was still lousy, and two more of his prized properties in Atlantic City would soon fall into bankruptcy, even as his ratings soared. To further enhance his brand, Trump used his prime-time perch to unveil another big project. On the 2006 season finale of The Apprentice, as 11 million viewers waited to learn which of the two finalists was going to be fired, Trump prolonged the suspense by cutting to a promotional video for his latest venture. “Located in the center of Manhattan’s chic artist enclave, the Trump International Hotel and Tower in SoHo is the site of my latest development,” he narrated over swooping helicopter footage of lower Manhattan. The new building, he added, would be nothing less than a “$370 million work of art … an awe-inspiring masterpiece.”   Trump SoHo was the brainchild of two development companies—Bayrock Group LLC and the Sapir Organization—run by a pair of wealthy émigrés from the former Soviet Union who had done business with some of Russia’s richest and most notorious oligarchs. Together, their firms made Trump an offer he couldn’t refuse: The developers would finance and build Trump SoHo themselves. In return for lending his name to the project, Trump would get 18 percent of the profits—without putting up any of his own money. One of the developers, Tamir Sapir, had followed an unlikely path to riches. After emigrating from the Soviet Union in the 1970s, he had started out driving a cab in New York City and ended up a billionaire living in Trump Tower. His big break came when he co-founded a company that sold high-tech electronics. According to the FBI, Sapir’s partner in the firm was a “member or associate” of Ivankov’s mob in Brighton Beach. No charges were ever filed, and Sapir denied having any mob ties. “It didn’t happen,” he told The New York Times. “Everything was done in the most legitimate way.” Trump, who described Sapir as a “great friend,” bought 200 televisions from his electronics company. In 2007, he hosted the wedding of Sapir’s daughter at Mar-a-Lago, and later attended her infant son’s bris.     In 2007, Trump celebrated the launch of Trump SoHo with partners Tevfik Arif (center) and Felix Sater (right). Arif was later acquitted on charges of running a prostitution ring.Mark Von Holden/WireImage/Getty  Sapir also introduced Trump to Tevfik Arif, his partner in the Trump SoHo deal. On paper, at least, Arif was another heartwarming immigrant success story. He had graduated from the Moscow Institute of Trade and Economics and worked as a Soviet trade and commerce official for 17 years before moving to New York and founding Bayrock. Practically overnight, Arif became a wildly successful developer in Brooklyn. In 2002, after meeting Trump, he moved Bayrock’s offices to Trump Tower, where he and his staff of Russian émigrés set up shop on the twenty-fourth floor. Trump worked closely with Bayrock on real estate ventures in Russia, Ukraine, and Poland. “Bayrock knew the investors,” he later testified. Arif “brought the people up from Moscow to meet with me.” He boasted about the deal he was getting: Arif was offering him a 20 to 25 percent cut on his overseas projects, he said, not to mention management fees. “It was almost like mass production of a car,” Trump testified. But Bayrock and its deals quickly became mired in controversy. Forbes and other publications reported that the company was financed by a notoriously corrupt group of oligarchs known as The Trio. In 2010, Arif was arrested by Turkish prosecutors and charged with setting up a prostitution ring after he was found aboard a boat—chartered by one of The Trio—with nine young women, two of whom were 16 years old. The women reportedly refused to talk, and Arif was acquitted. According to a lawsuit filed that same year by two former Bayrock executives, Arif started the firm “backed by oligarchs and money they stole from the Russian people.” In addition, the suit alleges, Bayrock “was substantially and covertly mob-owned and operated.” The company’s real purpose, the executives claim, was to develop hugely expensive properties bearing the Trump brand—and then use the projects to launder money and evade taxes.   The lawsuit, which is ongoing, does not claim that Trump was complicit in the alleged scam. Bayrock dismissed the allegations as “legal conclusions to which no response is required.” But last year, after examining title deeds, bank records, and court documents, the Financial Times concluded that Trump SoHo had “multiple ties to an alleged international money-laundering network.” In one case, the paper reported, a former Kazakh energy minister is being sued in federal court for conspiring to “systematically loot hundreds of millions of dollars of public assets” and then purchasing three condos in Trump SoHo to launder his “ill-gotten funds.”    Felix Sater had a Trump business card long after his criminal past came to light.   During his collaboration with Bayrock, Trump also became close to the man who ran the firm’s daily operations—a twice-convicted felon with family ties to Semion Mogilevich. In 1974, when he was eight years old, Felix Sater and his family emigrated from Moscow to Brighton Beach. According to the FBI, his father—who was convicted for extorting local restaurants, grocery stores, and a medical clinic—was a Mogilevich boss. Sater tried making it as a stockbroker, but his career came to an abrupt end in 1991, after he stabbed a Wall Street foe in the face with a broken margarita glass during a bar fight, opening wounds that required 110 stitches. (Years later, in a deposition, Trump downplayed the incident, insisting that Sater “got into a barroom fight, which a lot of people do.”) Sater lost his trading license over the attack, and served a year in prison. In 1998, Sater pleaded guilty to racketeering—operating a “pump and dump” stock fraud in partnership with alleged Russian mobsters that bilked investors of at least $40 million. To avoid prison time, Sater turned informer. But according to the lawsuit against Bayrock, he also resumed “his old tricks.” By 2003, the suit alleges, Sater controlled the majority of Bayrock’s shares—and proceeded to use the firm to launder hundreds of millions of dollars, while skimming and extorting millions more. The suit also claims that Sater committed fraud by concealing his racketeering conviction from banks that invested hundreds of millions in Bayrock, and that he threatened “to kill anyone at the firm he thought knew of the crimes committed there and might report it.” In court, Bayrock has denied the allegations, which Sater’s attorney characterizes as “false, fabricated, and pure garbage.”      By Sater’s account, in sworn testimony, he was very tight with Trump. He flew to Colorado with him, accompanied Donald Jr. and Ivanka on a trip to Moscow at Trump’s invitation, and met with Trump’s inner circle “constantly.” In Trump Tower, he often dropped by Trump’s office to pitch business ideas—“just me and him.” Trump seems unable to recall any of this. “Felix Sater, boy, I have to even think about it,” he told the Associated Press in 2015. Two years earlier, testifying in a video deposition, Trump took the same line. If Sater “were sitting in the room right now,” he swore under oath, “I really wouldn’t know what he looked like.” He added: “I don’t know him very well, but I don’t think he was connected to the mafia.” Trump and his lawyers say that he was unaware of Sater’s criminal past when he signed on to do business with Bayrock. That’s plausible, since Sater’s plea deal in the stock fraud was kept secret because of his role as an informant. But even after The New York Times revealed Sater’s criminal record in 2007, he continued to use office space provided by the Trump Organization. In 2010, he was even given an official Trump Organization business card that read: FELIX H. SATER, SENIOR ADVISOR TO DONALD TRUMP.    Sater apparently remains close to Trump’s inner circle. Earlier this year, one week before National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was fired for failing to report meetings with Russian officials, Trump’s personal attorney reportedly hand-delivered to Flynn’s office a “back-channel plan” for lifting sanctions on Russia. The co-author of the plan, according to the Times: Felix Sater. In the end, Trump’s deals with Bayrock, like so much of his business empire, proved to be more glitter than gold. The international projects in Russia and Poland never materialized. A Trump tower being built in Fort Lauderdale ran out of money before it was completed, leaving behind a massive concrete shell. Trump SoHo ultimately had to be foreclosed and resold. But his Russian investors had left Trump with a high-profile property he could leverage. The new owners contracted with Trump to run the tower; as of April, the president and his daughter Ivanka were still listed as managers of the property. In 2015, according to the federal financial disclosure reports, Trump made $3 million from Trump SoHo.  In April 2013, a little more than two years before Trump rode the escalator to the ground floor of Trump Tower to kick off his presidential campaign, police burst into Unit 63A of the high-rise and rounded up 29 suspects in two gambling rings. The operation, which prosecutors called “the world’s largest sports book,” was run out of condos in Trump Tower—including the entire fifty-first floor of the building. In addition, unit 63A—a condo directly below one owned by Trump—served as the headquarters for a “sophisticated money-laundering scheme” that moved an estimated $100 million out of the former Soviet Union, through shell companies in Cyprus, and into investments in the United States. The entire operation, prosecutors say, was working under the protection of Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov, whom the FBI identified as a top Russian vor closely allied with Semion Mogilevich. In a single two-month stretch, according to the federal indictment, the money launderers paid Tokhtakhounov $10 million.   Tokhtakhounov, who had been indicted a decade earlier for conspiring to fix the ice-skating competition at the 2002 Winter Olympics, was the only suspect to elude arrest. For the next seven months, the Russian crime boss fell off the radar of Interpol, which had issued a red alert. Then, in November 2013, he suddenly appeared live on international television—sitting in the audience at the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. Tokhtakhounov was in the VIP section, just a few seats away from the pageant owner, Donald Trump.    Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov. Dmitry Korotayev/Epsilon/Getty  After the pageant, Trump bragged about all the powerful Russians who had turned out that night, just to see him. “Almost all of the oligarchs were in the room,” he told  Real Estate Weekly. Contacted by Mother Jones, Tokhtakhounov insisted that he had bought his own ticket and was not a VIP. He also denied being a mobster, telling The New York Times that he had been indicted in the gambling ring because FBI agents “misinterpreted his Russian slang” on their Trump Tower wiretaps, when he was merely placing $20,000 bets on soccer games. Both the White House and the Trump Organization declined to respond to questions for this story. On the few occasions he has been questioned about his business entanglements with Russians, however, Trump has offered broad denials. “I tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia,” he said at a press conference in January, when asked if Russia has any “leverage” over him, financial or otherwise. “I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we’ve stayed away. And I have no loans with Russia. I have no loans with Russia at all.” In May, when he was interviewed by NBC’s Lester Holt, Trump seemed hard-pressed to think of a single connection he had with Russia. “I have had dealings over the years where I sold a house to a very wealthy Russian many years ago,” he said. “I had the Miss Universe pageant—which I owned for quite a while—I had it in Moscow a long time ago. But other than that, I have nothing to do with Russia.” But even if Trump has no memory of the many deals that he and his business made with Russian investors, he certainly did not “stay away” from Russia. For decades, he and his organization have aggressively promoted his business there, seeking to entice investors and buyers for some of his most high-profile developments. Whether Trump knew it or not, Russian mobsters and corrupt oligarchs used his properties not only to launder vast sums of money from extortion, drugs, gambling, and racketeering, but even as a base of operations for their criminal activities. In the process, they propped up Trump’s business and enabled him to reinvent his image. Without the Russian mafia, it is fair to say, Donald Trump would not be president of the United States.   Semion Mogilevich, the Russian mob’s “boss of bosses,” also declined to respond to questions from the New Republic. “My ideas are not important to anybody,” Mogilevich said in a statement provided by his attorney. “Whatever I know, I am a private person.” Mogilevich, the attorney added, “has nothing to do with President Trump. He doesn’t believe that anybody associated with him lives in Trump Tower. He has no ties to America or American citizens.” Back in 1999, the year before Trump staged his first run for president, Mogilevich gave a rare interview to the BBC. Living up to his reputation for cleverness, the mafia boss mostly joked and double-spoke his way around his criminal activities. (Q: “Why did you set up companies in the Channel Islands?” A: “The problem was that I didn’t know any other islands. When they taught us geography at school, I was sick that day.”) But when the exasperated interviewer asked, “Do you believe there is any Russian organized crime?” the “brainy don” turned half-serious. “How can you say that there is a Russian mafia in America?” he demanded. “The word mafia, as far as I understand the word, means a criminal group that is connected with the political organs, the police and the administration. I don’t know of a single Russian in the U.S. Senate, a single Russian in the U.S. Congress, a single Russian in the U.S. government. Where are the connections with the Russians? How can there be a Russian mafia in America? Where are their connections?”   Two decades later, we finally have an answer to Mogilevich’s question.           Ypsilanti Township — President Donald Trump pushed domestic and foreign auto executives for more U.S. jobs and new manufacturing plants here Wednesday, even as auto sales appear to be receding from record levels in 2016.   During a roundtable with industry officials, Trump mentioned General Motors Co.’s Wednesday announcement that it will add or retain 900 jobs in Michigan. “That’s going to be peanuts to the numbers that we’re going to see in the near future,” he said. Trump repeatedly stressed to the CEOs and senior leaders of 11 automakers, three suppliers and United Auto Workers President Dennis Williams that he wants to see automakers “build new plants in Michigan and other states.” He said that’s going to bring “thousands of jobs.” He talked with leaders from American, German, Japanese and South Korean automakers, with a backdrop of giant American flag and 10 American-made vehicles in an aircraft hangar. Trump told them he would reopen a review of a fuel economy mandate to achieve the equivalent of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. In the about 25-minute roundtable, he said the administration would work with them on reducing regulations and taxes, but he wanted to see new jobs. “I know you’re competitors, and you’ll always be competitors, but we’re all on the same side on … keeping jobs in America and creating new jobs in the United States,” Trump said at the American Center for Mobility. He urged new plants, not just expansions, and “modern plants, like you’re building in Mexico.” “We want to have new plants built in Michigan, and new plants built in Ohio, and new plants in Pennsylvania and North Carolina and so many other locations,” Trump said. “We’re going to make thousands and thousands and thousands of additional cars. And we’re going to make them in the United States,” he said. He echoed the push for auto jobs in a speech that ran about 18 minutes to hundreds of autoworkers who were bused from across Metro Detroit. He even teased another auto industry announcement next week but wouldn’t give any specifics. “We want to be the car capital of the world again,” Trump said. “We will be, and it won’t be long, believe me. ... We’re going to have a very big announcement next week having to do with your industry. Very, very big. Very important.” At one point in the roundtable, the president turned to Jim Lentz, chief executive of Toyota North America, and said: “You have to build plants here. I know I gave you a hard time but you have to build them here.” “I understand,” Lentz said. “I understand.” But Lentz after the speech said Trump’s demand that auto companies add more U.S. manufacturing jobs and factories might be tough for some. “If you take today as a starting point, that may not be fair to all companies,” he said. Toyota didn’t lay off a single U.S. factory worker during the recession in 2010, Lentz said. The company has since hired 8,000 people in America and invested $5 billion on American factories. The automaker plans to spend another $10 billion over the next five years to improve those plants, Lentz said. “Buy American and hire American,” Trump said during his speech at Willow Run Airport, adding that it is a pledge he plans to keep. The president told a mixed crowd of salaried and hourly workers from General Motors Co., Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Ford Motor Co. that he would fight to keep automobile production in the United States, often eliciting cheers. Automakers requested the review of the gas mileage mandate after Obama officials finalized the rules a year ahead of time in the last days of the Democratic administration. “The assault on the American auto industry is over,” Trump said. “Believe me, it’s over.” The president made clear that he thought the Obama administration overstepped by finalizing fuel rules. “If the standards threatened auto jobs, then common-sense changes could have and should have been made,” Trump said. Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne told reporters after the event he is glad the midterm review has been reopened and the process will go through as intended. He said the fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions targets can be met, but at a price. “The question is … the economic impact of the technology,” he said. “I think at the end of the day, the question is, ‘Can a consumer afford to pay for all the technology in the car?’ ” But during the round table discussion, the UAW’s Williams said he is worried about environmental standards for the automobile industry. “We all agree with you 100 percent. One hundred percent. We want you to make great cars but if it takes an extra thimble of fuel,” the administration wants the industry to do it, Trump said. Before the speech, Trump toured a display of 10 cars and trucks with Ford CEO Mark Fields, GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra, Marchionne, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. Barra and Williams sat on the each side of Trump during the roundtable, with Marchionne and Fields close by. The UAW’s Williams pushed the president, saying more U.S. auto factory workers also should be UAW members. “We want the workers to rise, too,” he said. “Some things never change,” said Trump, nodding and smiling. Prior to the speech, some industry employees said they were looking forward to hearing in person from the president — who has frequently called on U.S. automakers to increase stateside manufacturing. The Trump supporters included Bruce Sims, an engineer at Fiat Chrysler’s Sterling Stamping Plant who is also the shop chairperson for UAW Local 412 in Warren, He was wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat. “We want to hear about the free trade, we want to hear about the regulations he’s trying to lift that will help us out,” Sims said. The federal government needs to shape fuel economy standards that balance the needs of the economy and the environment, he said. “We want to keep the Earth, but we also want to keep jobs in America,” Sims said. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette was walking through the crowd, talking with other attendees. He said he would meet later with the president. “The fact he’s going to have a rewrite of these job-crushing, paycheck-crushing emission rules that the Obama administration tried to do at the midnight hour ... that’s a breath of fresh air for jobs and paychecks in Michigan,” Schuette said. ithibodeau@detroitnews.com Twitter: @Ian_Thibodeau  \\n\\t \\n \\n \\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n \\n  President Trump called himself “the world’s greatest person” in a phone conversation with Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, during which he attempted to refuse 1,250 refugees, according to recently leaked transcripts of the call.\\nA week after taking office in January, Trump called Turnbull, a chat that attracted attention at the time because of leaked accounts of Trump’s aggressiveness toward the fairly benign ally.\\nThe topic was immigration and how to stop it, a pet cause of the nationalist president, who has just announced his ban against travelers from six Muslim-majority countries.

I’m going to get killed on this thing”.\\nThe president then labeled the conversation “my most unpleasant call.”\\n Yesterday’s leaked transcripts also documented Trump’s first call with Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto, in which he tried to convince Nieto to stop saying that Mexico would not pay for Trump’s promised border wall.\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\t About the Author\\n \\n  \\n \\n\\t\\n \\t\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Trump: I\\'m President, you\\'re not\\n \\n 02:05\\n \\n - Source:\\n CNN\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Story highlights\\n \\n Time magazine\\'s cover story is called, \"Is Truth Dead?\"\\n Trump defended his method: \"I tend to be right\"\\n \\n\\n  \\n \\n CNN\\n \\xa0—\\xa0\\n \\n\\n \\n President Donald Trump defended some of the most controversial claims of his young political career in a wide-ranging interview with Time magazine published Thursday, in which he offered a simple and absolute defense of his method: \\n \\n \\n “I’m a very instinctual person, but my instinct turns out to be right.

Trump defended the claim by shifting its focus.\\n \\n \\n “When I said wiretapping, it was in quotes. Because a wiretapping is, you know, today it is different than wire tapping. It is just a good description. But wiretapping was in quotes.

The President, however, dismissed the key distinction between his claim and the type of legal and incidental intercepts Nunes had suggested. \\n \\n \\n “Just today I heard, just a little while ago, that Devin Nunes had a news conference, did you hear about this, where they have a lot of information on tapping. Did you hear about that?” Trump said. “House intelligence chairman Devin Nunes told reporters, wow. Nunes said, so that means I’m right, Nunes said the surveillance appears to have been … incidental collection, that does not appear to have been related to concerns over Russia.”\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n White House silent on wiretap claims\\n \\n 01:10\\n \\n - Source:\\n CNN\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n Trump also defended his administration’s controversial assertion that the British spy agency GCHQ surveilled his campaign at the request of the Obama administration – an allegation the agency has fiercely denied, and which prompted a diplomatic incident that national security adviser H.R. McMaster was drawn in to defuse. Trump seemed to concede that the information might have been bad, but wouldn’t admit fault for repeating it. \\n \\n \\n “I quoted the judge the other day, Judge Napolitano,” Trump told Time, referring to the Fox News contributor Andrew Napolitano, who reported the information on Fox News using anonymous sources, on which Trump’s White House based the claim. “I have a lot of respect for Judge Napolitano, and he said that three sources have told him things that would make me right. I don’t know where he has gone with it since then.

He’s a friend of mine. But that was in a newspaper. I wasn’t, I didn’t say that. I was referring to a newspaper.

I said, ‘No, Brexit is going to happen,’ and everybody laughed, and Brexit happened. Many many things. They turn out to be right,” he said.\\n \\n  \\n How healthy is President Donald Trump? We don’t really know. The president never released his full medical records, and instead opted for a surreal on-air physical with TV star Dr. Oz.\\nOne health aspect Trump is transparent about: He doesn’t like to break a sweat. To be more precise, he thinks physical activity will kill you faster. \\nIn a remarkable New Yorker story this week about how Donald Trump could realistically be removed from the presidency, Evan Osnos writes: “Other than golf, he considers exercise misguided, arguing that a person, like a battery, is born with a finite amount of energy.”\\nThe Trump “human body as non-rechargeable battery” theory was first detailed by Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher in their 2016 book, Trump Revealed: \\n After college, after Trump mostly gave up his personal athletic interests, he came to view time spent playing sports as time wasted. Trump believed the human body was like a battery, with a finite amount of energy, which exercise only depleted. So he didn’t work out. When he learned that John O’Donnell, one of his top casino executives, was training for an Ironman triathlon, he admonished him, \"You are going to die young because of this.\" \\nOn the campaign trail, we learned that Trump didn’t dedicate any extra time to breaking a sweat because he believes exercise is actually harmful, according to this 2015 New York Times profile: \\n Trump said he was not following any special diet or exercise regimen for the campaign. ‘‘All my friends who work out all the time, they’re going for knee replacements, hip replacements — they’re a disaster,’’ he said. He exerts himself fully by standing in front of an audience for an hour, as he just did. ‘‘That’s exercise.’”  \\nLet’s pause to consider how remarkably backward this is. \\nThere was a time when doctors would have concurred with Trump on this. That was the Victorian era. Back then, people worried a physical activity could cause everything from exhaustion and heart palpitations, particularly in women. \\nA century later, doctors’ thinking has moved on. Research now shows exercise is actually the closest thing we have to a miracle cure.\\nRegular physical activity can “prevent dementia, type 2 diabetes, some cancers, depression, heart disease and other common serious conditions — reducing the risk of each by at least 30%,” according to this 2015 report on the benefits of exercise from the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges. “This is better than many drugs,” the authors wrote. \\nIt also helps people live longer. “Many studies give an approximate 30% risk reduction in all-cause mortality. Smoking is the biggest contributor to early mortality and years living with chronic illness and disability. Physical inactivity, through multiple mechanisms produces an effect one-third the effect of smoking.” Overall, the researchers found, regular exercise reduces cardiac death by 31 percent. \\nSo for Trump, exercise is deadly. But according to science, it’s a miracle drug. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n $95/year\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n $120/year\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n $250/year\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Other\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Yes, I\\'ll give $120/year\\n \\n \\n \\n Yes, I\\'ll give $120/year\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n We accept credit card, Apple Pay, and\\n \\n \\n Google Pay.

Jonathan Ernst / Reuters      President Trump remains peculiarly fixated on the cover of Time magazine. He has claimed in the past that he holds the record for most covers, but in an interview with Michael Scherer for this week’s magazine, the president asked if he was the all-time leader. Scherer had to break the bad news to him: Richard M. Nixon still held the lead—though he added, “He was in office for longer, so give yourself time.” “Ok, good. I’m sure I’ll win,” Trump replied. The exchange is full of intrigue. Neither man noted that though Nixon was elected to two terms, his presidency was foreshortened by paranoia and lawbreaking. Nor did they note the increasingly frequent comparisons between Nixon’s terminal scandal and Trump’s own difficulties. But in the course of an interview about Trump’s extremely distant relationship with the truth—from obvious lies to head-scratching speculation—the president offered Nixonian maxim of his own. “I can’t be doing so badly, because I’m president, and you’re not,” he said. Nixon famously, and incorrectly, told David Frost, “When the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.” Trump is offering an even more absurd thesis: When the president says it, that means it’s true. It’s Trump’s excuse throughout the piece. Time and again, Scherer asks Trump about statements that he has made without evidence, and time and again, Trump insists that something that happened later retroactively justifies the claims he has made, effectively arguing that lies have been alchemically transformed into truths after the fact. Time’s cover, the president was surely sad to discover, is not his face but the words, “Is Truth Dead?” over a somber black background. The problem is that later events don’t make things any less false, and in many cases, Trump is also lying about the ex post facto justifications. Trump says, for example, that after he claimed there was chaos in Sweden, there were riots. “Sweden. I make the statement, everyone goes crazy. The next day they have a massive riot, and death, and problems,” Trump told Time. He is off on the details—the riot was two days later—but he is also misleading. His original statement was, “You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this?” There was still no riot the night before. Even his own standards of retroactive justification, he’s only in the vague vicinity of truth. The same pattern has gone for his claim that Barack Obama “wiretapped” him at Trump Tower. Trump made an outlandish, inflammatory claim with no evidence, and has now sought to prove it after the fact. “I have articles saying it happened,” he told Time, but there are no reputable reports justifying his claims, only thinly sourced conspiracy theories. Republicans in Congress and intelligence officials have debunked those reports, and Fox News suspended the legal analyst who made a claim on which Trump was relying. Nonetheless, Trump cited the analyst again in his interview. Trump also claims that information revealed by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes vindicates his claim. That claim, too, falls apart upon the slightest scrutiny: First, Nunes still says there was no wiretap; second, Nunes’s revelation is too vague and sketchy to prove anything; and third, Nunes said that Trump was unaware of the information, showing again that Trump had made his claim without any proof. That’s not bold truthtelling—that’s misleading the American people. At other times, Trump simply claims he’s been proven right when that has not happened. He continues to claim, falsely, that Muslims celebrated in Jersey City on 9/11. Pressed on that, he told Scherer, “Well if you look at the reporter, he wrote the story in The Washington Post.” The reporter, Serge Kovaleski, did not write a story saying what Trump says he did. The president seems to believe that by saying something, he can conjure it into existence. “I’m a very instinctual person, but my instinct turns out to be right,” he said. Trump has lied about millions of people voting unlawfully in the 2016 election. “I think I will be proved right about that too,” he said. “We’ll see after the committee. I have people say it was more than that. We will see after we have. But there will be, we are forming a committee.” Despite speaking of a committee, there doesn’t actually appear to be any committee looking into the fraud allegations. His relationship with the press remains vexed. On the one hand, he calls outlets fake and misleading; on the other, he happily points to press reports, real or imagined, to justify what he cannot prove. That includes the Jersey City claim and the wiretap claim. It also includes Trump’s allegation that Ted Cruz’s father was involved in the Kennedy assassination. “Well, that was in a newspaper,” Trump said. “No, no, I like Ted Cruz, he’s a friend of mine. But that was in the newspaper. I wasn’t, I didn’t say that. I was referring to a newspaper.” But the “newspaper” in question was the National Enquirer, a tabloid that seldom makes any pretense at accuracy, and even then, Trump “referring” to the paper doesn’t change the fact that he said it. This reaches to the heart of the problem. Having spent his career in business and entertainment, where he could shoot off his mouth with relatively minor consequences, and despite envying the bully pulpit of the presidency for decades and bragging that he is the president, he cannot understand the difference in importance between what a TV personality says and what the president of the United States says publicly. “Is there anything different about making these kinds of predictions without having the factual evidence as president?” Scherer asked. But Trump deflected the question, which he cannot address because he refuses to accept its premise. My colleague James Fallows wrote Tuesday\\xa0 that eventually, Trump will require the public to trust him on a matter of urgent national security, and he will not receive the benefit of the doubt. What Trump’s Time interview suggests is not simply that he is unworried about eroding public faith in his ability to be truthful. Perhaps that is not because of a blithe ignorance of this looming danger, but because the president is incapable of telling truth and falsehood apart.     By Dan Christensen, FloridaBulldog.org\\xa0 \\n     President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein \\nPresident Donald Trump is on a list of witnesses for trial in a Palm Beach lawsuit that pits billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein against a Fort Lauderdale attorney who represents Epstein’s victims.\\nThe case appears bound for trial this summer following a Feb. 9 ruling by the Florida Supreme Court in another case that has allowed Fort Lauderdale lawyer Bradley Edwards’ claim of malicious prosecution against Epstein to proceed.\\nPresident Trump “has been identified as an individual who may have information relating to these allegations,” said Edwards’ West Palm Beach attorney Jack Scarola, who placed Trump’s name on a witness list on Aug. 31. “But it’s unlikely that he would ever be called” to appear at trial, especially now that he’s assumed the presidency.\\nScarola said Trump is one of a number of high-profile individuals whose testimony might be relevant because they “had a relationship with Epstein that would have at least exposed them potentially to what was going on inside Epstein’s Palm Beach home … during the relevant period of time” between 2001-2007.\\nWhat was going on in Epstein’s mansion, court papers say, was an ugly child molestation scheme involving sex with “substantially more” than 40 girls, some as young as 12. A “statement of undisputed facts” filed by Scarola says Epstein used his staff and his victims to recruit more victims, employing “a pyramid abuse scheme in which he paid underage victims $200-$300 cash for each other underage victim that she brought to him.”\\n“There is no evidence the President was involved in Epstein’s schemes,” Scarola said.\\n     Secretary of Labor nominee Alex Acosta \\nStill, the spectacle of a U.S. president being drawn into sordid litigation involving a notorious politically connected sexual criminal who got an apparent sweetheart deal from then-Miami U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta, now Trump’s nominee to become U.S. Secretary of Labor, represents a potential political nightmare for the White House.\\nThe White House press office did not respond to requests for comment.\\nEpstein’s attorney, Tonja Haddad Coleman, declined to comment.\\nAn affidavit about Trump\\nA little-noticed affidavit by Edwards recounting his knowledge of Trump’s involvement with Epstein is recounted further below in this story.\\nInvestment banker Epstein, represented by a team of high-powered lawyers, pleaded guilty June 30, 2008 in Palm Beach Circuit Court to two felonies: procuring a person under 18 for prostitution and offering to commit prostitution. He served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. The Palm Beach Daily News has reported Epstein served his time in “a vacant wing at the Palm Beach County Stockade with liberal work-release privileges.”\\nToday, Epstein, 64, is a registered sex offender. \\nIn exchange for his plea, U.S. Attorney Acosta agreed not prosecute Epstein or his employees on federal charges contained in a 53-page indictment. A 2007 federal non-prosecution agreement with Epstein states, among other things, that he “knowingly and willfully” conspired with others to use interstate commerce to “persuade, induce, or entice minor females to engage in prostitution.”\\nIf convicted of that charge, and others cited in the agreement, Epstein faced possible prison for life.\\nRepublican Acosta, dean of Florida International University’s Law School and chairman of U.S. Century Bank, is expected to be asked about his treatment of Epstein at his Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday.\\nIn addition to the malicious prosecution claim against Epstein, attorney Edwards is also suing the government on behalf of “Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2” and others under the federal Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA). The lawsuit, filed in 2008, alleges the U.S. Attorney’s Office under Acosta violated the rights of Epstein’s victims by, among other things, “conspiring” with Epstein to keep them “in the dark’’ so the plea arrangement could be done without the victims “raising any objection.”\\n     Wifredo Ferrer, who stepped down as Miami U.S. Attorney earlier this month \\nIn February 2016, Edwards and co-counsel Paul Cassell filed a still-pending motion for summary judgment that says Acosta’s successor, Wifredo Ferrer, “has continued to fight” victims’ efforts “to have the court declare that their rights were violated.” The motion asks U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra to rule that the government violated the victims’ rights and explore possible remedies. Ferrer stepped down March 3.\\nAddressing a “terrible injustice”\\n“Both Brad and Professor Cassell undertook and have continued to prosecute the CVRA claim to address what they perceive to be a terrible injustice,” said Scarola. “There is no claim for money damages and there is no prevailing party provision in the CVRA” that would allow them to collect legal fees for their work on the case.\\nAttorney Edwards began representing several of Epstein’s victims while maintaining a solo law practice in 2008, settling a number of claims for undisclosed amounts two years later.\\nFor eight months in 2009, however, he worked for Rothstein, Rosenfeldt and Adler, the law firm that spectacularly imploded in scandal in November of that year when it was discovered that founder Scott Rothstein was running a giant Ponzi scheme. Rothstein, now in prison, enticed investors by falsely claiming that they could buy into lucrative pending settlements in whistleblower, sexual harassment and other cases.\\nEdwards’ court papers say he knew nothing of Rothstein’s schemes, and federal authorities later determined Edwards to have been one of Rothstein’s victims. In 2009, however, Epstein sued Rothstein, Edwards and one of Edwards’ clients alleging, among other things, civil racketeering. Edwards’ court response: the suit was filed “for the sole purpose of attempting to intimidate” him and his client.\\nEpstein later dropped all his allegations, and Edwards since has turned the case back against him with his counterclaim of malicious prosecution. The case was on hold for two years pending last month’s Florida Supreme Court ruling, which reversed a lower court decision that dismissed the accusation on technical grounds.\\nEdwards won’t discuss either case. But in a little-noticed 2010 affidavit, given a year after the case was filed, Edwards explained why he thought Trump and other notables involved with Epstein, including former President Bill Clinton, might have relevant information to provide.\\n“If you’ve read Brad’s affidavit then you know everything there is to know regarding Trump,” Scarola said.\\nDoes Trump have knowledge of Epstein’s crimes?\\nIn his affidavit, Edwards suggests Trump has personal knowledge of Epstein’s criminality.\\n“I learned through a source that Trump banned Epstein from his Maralago [Mar-A- Lago] Club in West Palm Beach because Epstein sexually assaulted an underage girl at the club,” Edwards stated.\\nThe affidavit notes that Trump visited Epstein at Epstein’s West Palm Beach home – “the same home where Epstein abused minor girls daily.”\\n     Fort Lauderdale attorney Bradley Edwards \\nA “review of message pads confiscated from Epstein’s home” showed “that Trump called Epstein’s West Palm Beach mansion on several occasions during the time period relevant to my client’s complaints,” the affidavit says. Likewise “Epstein’s phone directory from his computer contains 14 phone numbers for Donald Trump, including emergency numbers, car numbers, and numbers to Trump’s security guard and houseman.”\\nThe affidavit goes on to say that one of Epstein’s victims “Jane Doe #102” has alleged that she was initially approached at Trump’s Mar-A-Lago by Ghislaine Maxwell and recruited to be Maxwell and Epstein’s “underage sex slave.”\\nMaxwell, daughter of the late British publishing baron Robert Maxwell, is named in the affidavit as an Epstein associate of interest. She is described in court papers as Epstein’s “longtime companion” who helped run his companies and “recruit underage children” for the pleasure of both Epstein and herself. The affidavit says she attended the wedding of Chelsea Clinton, Bill and Hillary Clinton’s daughter, in July 2010.\\nThe affidavit goes on to cite the 2009 deposition of Epstein’s brother, Mark Epstein, who “testified that Trump flew on Jeffrey Epstein’s plane with him (the same plane that Jane Doe 102 alleged was used to have sex with underage girls).”\\nLikewise, attorney Edwards cited in his affidavit a 2002 New York Magazine article about Epstein titled, “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery.”\\n“I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” said Trump, then a prominent, wealthy New York developer. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it – Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”\\nThe subtitle of the article about Epstein: “He’s pals with a passel of Nobel Prize-winning scientists, CEOs like Leslie Wexner of the Limited, socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, even Donald Trump. But it wasn’t until he flew Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, and Chris Tucker to Africa on his private Boeing 727 that the world began to wonder who he is.”\\nA second U.S. president\\nWhile ex-President Clinton is not on the witness list for trial, Edwards listed a number of reasons in his affidavit to believe that Clinton might have relevant information about Epstein. They include:\\n·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Clinton’s “well known” friendship with Ghislaine Maxwell, an alleged enabler of Epstein’s sexual crimes with young girls.\\n·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Clinton’s highly publicized travel with Epstein and Maxwell aboard Epstein’s private plane to Africa. Flight logs for “the relevant years 2002-2005 showed Clinton traveling on Epstein’s plane on more than 10 occasions and his assistant, Doug Band, traveled on many more occasions.” The logs also showed Clinton traveled with other “employees and/or co-conspirators of Epstein’s that were closely connected to Epstein’s child exploitation and sexual abuse.”\\n·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “Jane Doe No. 102 stated generally that she was required by Epstein to be exploited not only by Epstein but also Epstein’s ‘adult male peers, including royalty, politicians, academicians, businessmen and/or other professional and personal acquaintances’ – categories Clinton and acquaintances of Clinton fall into.”\\n     Ex-President Bill Clinton \\n·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “Clinton frequently flew with Epstein aboard his plane, then suddenly stopped – raising the suspicion that the friendship abruptly ended, perhaps because of events related to Epstein’s sexual abuse of children.”\\n·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Epstein’s computer contact list “contains e-mail addresses for Clinton along with 21 phone numbers for him.”\\nAttorney Scarola would not say why Clinton is not on the Aug. 31 witness list, stating he is “not at liberty to discuss our litigation strategy.”\\nEdwards initially sought to depose Trump and Clinton about Epstein, but never did. Scarola said there was no need to depose them after Epstein dropped his racketeering and other claims against Edwards.\\nWhile there are other notables on the witness list of those with knowledge of Epstein, including retired Harvard University law professor Alan Dershowitz and illusionist David Copperfield, there’s only one other politician. That’s ex-New Mexico Governor and Clinton Administration Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson.\\nThe affidavit says Epstein’s personal pilot, Larry Morrison, testified in a 2009 deposition about “Richardson joining Epstein at Epstein’s New Mexico ranch” and that “there was information that Epstein had young girls at his ranch which, given the circumstances of the case, raised the reasonable inference he was sexually abusing these girls since he had regularly and frequently abused girls in West Palm Beach and elsewhere.\\n“Richardson had also returned campaign donations that were given to him by Epstein, indicating that he believed that there was something about Epstein that he did not want to be associated with,” the affidavit says.\\n       CLEVELAND — Donald Trump says he\\'s \"instructed my people\" to explore the possibility of helping pay the legal bills for a 78-year-old man charged with assault at a Trump rally.

These intersections of my job and theirs is typically scripted: They show up in town and, handed the assignment, I seek a perch from which to take a picture. But I was doing one of the more mundane parts of my job, hunting for a slice-of-life photo for the next day’s paper, when I crossed paths with the man who would become the nation’s 45th president. It was a sticky Monday morning in July 1995, when I pulled out of\\xa0The Palm Beach Post parking lot and headed south on Dixie Highway. I was in a Toyota Tercel that had outlived its air-conditioning and ahead of me was a factory-fresh Lemans blue Lamborghini Diablo Roadster. Eager to pass the slow moving sports car worth some 10 times my ride, I pulled ahead only to realize my photo hunt could be over with the man seated behind the Lamborghini’s wheel: Palm Beach part-timer Donald Trump. What was his glamorous destination? I followed him. His first stop? The Mobil gas station at the corner of Forest Hill Boulevard and Dixie. Before my eyes an international business tycoon renown for ‘The Art of the Deal’ was about to execute his next purchase: gas. I approached him, identifying myself as a Palm Beach Post photographer, and asked permission to take his picture. His polite reply: No problem, but I bet this will end up in the tabloids.

The US President has been “identified as an individual who may have information” relating to allegations about Epstein, Jack Scarola told the LawNewz.com website.  He said there is evidence that at least one former employee at Mr Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, was recruited by an associate of Epstein to become involved in alleged sex offences.  The civil trial, due to start later this year, involves allegations of malicious prosecution and defamation filed by Bradley Edwards, a Florida lawyer who previously represented several of Epstein’s alleged victims in separate cases from 2009.  In the affidavit filed in support of case, Mr Edwards claims that Mark Epstein (Jeffrey’s brother) testified that Mr Trump flew on Jeffrey Epstein’s plane with him, LegalNewz.com reported. “Epstein’s phone directory from his computer contains 14 phone numbers for Donald Trump, including emergency numbers, car numbers, and numbers to Trump’s security guard and houseman,” the affidavit reportedly claims. Court records in an earlier civil case against Mr Epstein allege that he molested more than 40 girls between 2002 and 2005 at his Florida mansion. There is no evidence to suggest any involvement from Mr Trump, but the records claim that “message pads confiscated from Epstein’s home indicated that Trump called Epstein’s West Palm Beach mansion on several occasions”. It also quotes an interview with Mr Trump, featured in  New York Magazine , in which he said: “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it, Jeffrey enjoys his social life.” In 2007, Epstein was given what critics branded a “sweetheart” deal by federal prosecutors over allegations he sexually assaulted young girls. The deal was overseen by Alexander Acosta, Mr Trump’s now Labour Secretary nominee. Mr Acosta is expected to face questions on the issue at his upcoming Senate confirmation hearing. The non-prosecution agreement ensured Epstein and any “co-conspirators” would not be prosecuted federally in exchange for the billionaire pleading guilty to state charges.    \\nWomen go on strike against Donald TrumpShow all 7  Mr Scarola said the chances are “very low” that Mr Trump would be called as a witness at the trial. “There are, as you might imagine, substantial hurdles in calling a sitting US president and we don’t want any further delays on this case,” he said. The Trump Organization has been contacted for a response but none had arrived at the time of publication.    BEDMINSTER, N.J. —\\xa0In rural New Jersey, the president\\'s business has proposed an unusual real estate project. It wants to build a cemetery. Or maybe not. Or maybe two. According to plans filed with local and state authorities, the Trump Organization has proposed to build a pair of graveyards at the site of its tony Trump National Bedminster golf course. One would be small, 10 plots overlooking the first hole. It was intended - or so they said - for Donald Trump and his family. \"Mr. Trump . . . specifically chose this property for his final resting place as it is his favorite property,\" his company wrote in a filing with the state in 2014. The other proposed cemetery would have 284 lots for sale to the public. There, buyers could pay for a kind of eternal membership in Trump\\'s club —\\xa0even if it isn\\'t clear Trump himself would ever join them. Those are the plans. But Trump has been talking about cemeteries here for 10 years —\\xa0and he\\'s shown the same unpredictable decision-making style about his death that he has about so many things in his life. His plans have gone through at least five major overhauls. Trump has reconsidered his own burial spot at least twice. Local officials were left puzzling, wondering what angle Trump was playing. Did the world\\'s most famous Manhattanite really want to be buried in nowheresville New Jersey? If not . . . well, why in the world was he pretending like he did? \"It never made any sense to me,\" said Robert Holtaway, a longtime town official who heard Trump\\'s plans on the Bedminster Land Use Board. But, he said, \"we don\\'t question motives. We\\'re there as a land use board.\" Both Eric Trump and a Trump Organization spokeswoman declined to comment about what they planned to do. President Trump already has a family burial plot: his parents and his brother Fred are buried together at All Faiths Cemetery in Queens. So it was a surprise, back in 2007, when Trump announced he wanted a mausoleum for himself in New Jersey. \"It\\'s never something you like to think about, but it makes sense,\" Trump told the New York Post. He was 60 years old at the time. \"This is such beautiful land, and Bedminster is one of the richest places in the country.\" The plan was big: 19 feet high. Stone. Obelisks. Set smack in the middle of the golf course. In Bedminster —\\xa0a wealthy horse-country town 43 miles west of New York City —\\xa0officials had some concerns about hosting a reality TV star\\'s tomb. The huge structure would seem garish, out of place. And there were ongoing worries that the spot might become an \"attractive nuisance,\" tempting curiosity-seekers to trespass on club grounds. Trump offered a concession. The tomb would be versatile. It could also be a festive wedding . . . tomb. \"We\\'re planning a mausoleum/chapel,\" Trump said, according to a news report from the time. That didn\\'t do it. \"Give me a break. Give me a break,\" Holtaway, the town official, remembered thinking. \"Why would anyone ever get married in a building with no windows?\" Trump withdrew the plan to be buried in New Jersey. But five years later, he was back with another one. Now, the mausoleum was out —\\xa0but, instead, he had a plan to build a large cemetery with more than 1,000 graves, including one for him. The idea, apparently, was that Trump\\'s golf-club members would buy the other plots, seizing the chance at eternal membership. \"It\\'s one thing to be buried in a typical cemetery,\" said Ed Russo, a consultant who represented Trump here. \"But it\\'s another if you\\'re buried alongside the fifth fairway of Trump National.\" The town was, again, skeptical. So Trump whittled it down to just 10 graves, enough for himself and his family members. Which family members, exactly? \"Only the good Trumps,\" Russo said, according to a video of the town land use board. He did not elaborate. The town approved. The state approved, granting a cemetery license in late 2014. Then Trump changed his mind. Russo told the town that Trump might want to be buried somewhere in Florida, after all. Trump lived part time at his Mar-a-Lago Club before his election (and, now, after the election as well). Then, with approval for the small cemetery in hand, Trump came back with a new plan, for a bigger cemetery. This time, the plan was for 284 graves. The cemetery would be run by a nonprofit, and Trump\\'s golf course would handle maintenance, grass-cutting and gravedigging. This plan, on the surface, made little sense. For one thing, it would be a very poor way to make money. The cemetery business is bad in New Jersey, because the land is expensive, plots sell for cheap, and cremation is stealing their customers. You need volume to succeed. And the volume at Trump\\'s cemetery would be very low. Trump\\'s cemetery —\\xa0with people selected by a kind of membership committee —\\xa0would handle just one to two burials per year, officials said. Cemetery plots in New Jersey cost, at most, a few thousand dollars each. The money, such as it was, would go to the nonprofit company. But maybe the point wasn\\'t to make money. Could this whole thing have been a scheme to reduce the Trump Organization\\'s real estate taxes? After all, nonprofit cemeteries pay no taxes on their land. That\\'s possible, experts said. But, in this case, the savings would hardly be worth the trouble. That\\'s because Trump had already found a way to lower his taxes on that wooded, largely unused parcel. He had convinced the township to declare a farm, because some trees on the site are turned into mulch. Because of pro-farmer tax policies, Trump\\'s company pays just $16.31 per year in taxes on the parcel, which he bought for $461,000. \"It\\'s always been my suspicion that there\\'s something we don\\'t know,\" about the explanation behind the seemingly inexplicable cemetery plan, said Bedminster land-use board member Nick Strakhov. So why were they doing it? \"I did not ask,\" Strakhov said. \"It\\'s an obvious question.\" The land use board approved unanimously, after some inconclusive quizzing (Strakhov had to be absent and didn\\'t vote). Now, the Trump Organization still needs to apply for state approval for this larger, public cemetery. And it still needs to settle the larger question: Does President Trump still want to be buried in New Jersey? Other presidents have chosen to be buried at their presidential libraries. Trump, like any president, also has the option of Arlington National Cemetery. A White House spokeswoman said she did not know of any public statements by Trump on the subject. Seeking answers, the Washington Post reached Russo, the consultant who had spent years as the point person for Trump\\'s cemetery plans. Russo has written a book about his work with Trump on various land-use projects. It is called \"Donald J. Trump, An Environmental Hero.\" It was a brief call. Russo said he was driving, and that he might call back. The Post tried to get in one quick question. Were the cemetery plans still on? Russo laughed. \"Pretty funny,\" he said. \"I have to drive here. So I will do that.\" He did not call back.  The Washington Post\\'s Jonathan O\\'Connell contributed to this report.    It\\'s amazing any American ever fell for the idea that Donald Trump was a world-class business executive who would bring first-rate private-sector leadership — the ability to hire the best people and motivate them to do great work — to Washington. Seven weeks into the presidency, all is chaos. Appointees are jumping ship and recusing themselves. The man in charge, a tweeting laughingstock, is paranoid and frequently furious at those around him. And Congress is gearing up investigations into the Trump team\\'s ties to the Russians who schemed to interfere in our election. Those who\\'ve followed Trump over the years saw much of this coming. We know him not as a CEO, but as the head of a family business that, far from innovating to outflank its competitors, always served Trump\\'s ego first and foremost. It all began with his upbringing in Queens, where, as the son of one of America\\'s richest men, he was instilled with the message that he was a \"killer\" and a \"king.\" Never employed outside the family, he spent his adult life producing a leadership record that was spotty at best. Even when he was a success, as he was in his early real estate endeavors, Trump was impatient, boorish and temperamental. The architect who designed Trump Tower famously reported on a moment when news that some drawings would be late caused Trump to \"scream, shout, curse and swear. He kicked a chair across the conference room with such force that I thought he would ruin his Gucci shoes.\" His longtime construction manager, Barbara Res, would say of people who worked for Trump, \"Some respect him, some don\\'t. Many hate his guts.\" When Trump failed, he was a hell-on-wheels boss. Two examples from the early 1990s illustrate this trait.    Manager of one (Evan Vucci/AP)    When he bought the Eastern Shuttle and renamed it Trump Shuttle, Trump hired some seasoned executives to run it but wouldn\\'t let them do their jobs. He even pressed to reduce flight crews despite the safety objections of his managers. In 2015, Bruce Nobles, who went from Pan Am to Trump Shuttle, told the Daily Beast: \"I cringed every time he opened his mouth. He really didn\\'t understand the business and at times he said things that really weren\\'t helpful That was his style and it really hasn\\'t changed.\" Trump fired Nobles but never made the company a success, and before long sold it. Trump\\'s performance as a casino boss was just as spotty. As one of the first to open a gambling hall in Atlantic City, he enjoyed initial success facing limited competition. However when other casinos came online and he launched an overly ambitious expansion, Trump\\'s Atlantic City operation was plagued with problems. John O\\'Donnell, a gambling industry veteran Trump hired, published a memoir of his time with Trump that read like a business book version of \"Mommy Dearest.\" Tormented by Trump for years, O\\'Donnell was subjected to one too many tirades and walked. His book depicted the man who would become President as a profane, impatient man who wouldn\\'t tolerate dissent. Trump trashed O\\'Donnell in the press but also told magazine writer Mark Bowden, \"The stuff O\\'Donnell wrote about me is probably true.\" With his A.C. businesses on the rocks, Trump began a series of corporate bankruptcies. His business model changed as he focused on licensing his name to properties others owned and began a reality TV host. On his program \"The Apprentice,\" Trump eliminated contestants week by week until a winner got a job with his firm.    The Daily News Flash   Weekdays Catch up on the day’s top five stories every weekday afternoon.  Randall Pinkett, who won in show\\'s fourth season, discovered that in real life Trump couldn\\'t tolerate strong executives. According to Pinkett, \"Donald surrounds himself with people who don\\'t challenge him. He weeds out people who want to challenge Donald or who want to be critical of Donald.\"    President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump greet trick-or-treaters on the South Lawn during a Halloween celebration at the White House on Sunday, Oct. 25, 2020, in Washington, DC. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)  When, in 2015 I visited Trump Tower to interview the big boss and the people around him, I saw much that confirmed Pinkett\\'s point of view. No one there ever took credit for any of the organization\\'s successes and no one ever criticized the man in charge. Only his grown children, Donald, Ivanka and Eric, dared to say they ever stood up to him, and they confided that when they had to do so, they preferred to visit him as a group. United, they said, they might persuade him to accept that their advice had merit and was meant to help him. At the White House, Ivanka cannot turn to her brothers to support her in a debate with boss Trump. Few of the others in the West Wing had any experience with him prior to the election campaign. And it shows. After every outburst, every meltdown, every tantrum, every torrent of lies, his minions scramble as if their jobs depend, not on honesty and accuracy but on pleasing Trump. It\\'s a sad reaction, but the President himself wouldn\\'t have it any other way.

It was, in fact, a young President Trump who had taught Chuck Berry how to play guitar in the first place.\\n“I am as sad as anyone that the legendary showman Chuck Berry is no longer with us,” said the President, “In fact, I am more sad than anyone, considering I taught him everything he knew.”\\nThe president, not known for musicianship, or for any musical talent at all, took pains Saturday to say how much he had enjoyed listening to Chuck Berry play all of the guitar licks he had taught him when visiting St Louis as a young child in 1949 when he was three years old.\\n“My father, as you know, was a very successful real estate developer, and he would travel the country as part of his business. And it so happens that we visited St Louis right after I learned to play electric guitar,” the President said. “I was very young. Maybe three or four years old. But I was a master at the instrument. I could play it up and down the neck like nobody else.”\\n“Well, we were at a high school dance one night, and the guitarist for the band couldn’t play because he had hurt his hand changing a flat tire in the parking lot. My father suggested I get up and play, and so I did.” \\nWeird Guy\\n“There was this weird guy backstage who was listening to me play. I was quite good by the way – the girls were very into my performance even as a three year old. And this guy goes over and calls up his cousin and plays him my music over the phone. Later, it turns out, the cousin was Chuck Berry.” \\nWhen he first heard his own songs on the radio being played by another musician, President Trump was not angry. “I thought, you know what? This guy must be a pretty smart guy. He knew a bunch of hit songs when he heard them.”\\nAlthough the President is not credited on any of the 200+ songs that Mr. Berry wrote, he did not pursue the Rock Legend in court. “I was so successful in the real estate business, that I really didn’t have time to assert the copyright on ‘Johnny B. Goode’, or ‘Roll Over Beethoven’ or the other 14 songs I had played that night at the dance” said the President. \\n“And then when the Beatles and Rolling Stones started covering my music, I figured I would just wait until they’d made a lot of money, and then I would bring a lawsuit against all of them at once.”\\nMany Billions\\nWhen asked what he thinks his song catalog is worth, President Trump estimated it was in the billions. “I know for a fact that Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Neil Sedaka, all the greats, they all heard me play as a young kid. It seemed like every time I turned on the radio, I heard another of my songs. So, it’s going to be a very, very big settlement. Many billions.”\\nRepresentatives at performance rights organizations ASCAP and BMI were not available for comment on the impending lawsuits. However, a spokesperson who manages the museum for Viennese composer Joseph Hayden said they had been contacted by lawyers for president Trump, who was claiming copyright for the composers work from 1767-1783. \\nThe museum, a non-profit dedicated to preserving the original manuscripts of Hayden, hopes to settle out of court.\\n makeamericathebest.com \\nYour Trusted Source for Faux News\\n    “One of the greatest memories of all time.” —\\xa0President \\xa0Trump, Oct. 25,\\xa0pointing to his head, explaining why his account of\\xa0his call to a Gold Star widow is to be believed.

He sent out condolence letters that were the best and most thoughtful condolence letters, even if they were delivered by rush post. He remembers that what really counts is that he tried.

This explains everything about Donald Trump.   President Trump has granted the CIA permission to carry out drone attacks against suspected terrorists, breaking with previous policy and potentially reigniting contentious discussions between the intelligence agency and Pentagon officials, according to a report. The CIA used to only be allowed to operate drones for surveillance purposes and, in the event that suspected terrorists were located, agency officials would alert the Pentagon who would then conduct the actual strike. But U.S. officials told The Wall Street Journal on Monday that Trump secretly overhauled that policy shortly after his Jan. 21 speech at the CIA headquarters in Virginia — and human rights groups claim the covert order could have troublesome effects on transparency and accountability. \"There are a lot of problems with the drone program and the targeted killing program, but the CIA should be out of the business of ordering lethal strikes,\" Christopher Anders, ACLU\\'s deputy Washington director, told The Journal. \"It does not mean the CIA cannot have a role in assisting in the use of force in locating targets, but that decision on whether to strike or not to strike and that order should be coming from through the military chain of command.\" Contrary to the Pentagon, the CIA does not need to publicly disclose drone activity. The agency also doesn\\'t need to report whether covert attacks cause civilian casualties.    President Trump apparently gave the secret order shortly after his Jan. 21 speech at the CIA headquarters in Virgnia. (Olivier Douliery / POOL/EPA)    Trump\\'s previously undisclosed decision specifically extends CIA\\'s drone operations in Syria, but officials speculated that the move will eventually also include other countries with ties to terrorism, such as Yemen, Libya and Somalia. The White House did not immediately respond to questions from the Daily News. Trump has ever since the campaign trail pledged to escalate U.S. intervention in the war against ISIS and other extremist groups. The unexpected drone decision was presumably meant to signify such escalation, but officials said it spurred confusion among federal agencies and Pentagon officials. The move is sure to spark discussions between the Defense Department and the CIA. The two argued extensively about the issue during the Obama years, with CIA officials charging that limitations caused unnecessary gridlock and Pentagon officials claiming that the existing rules were necessary to ensure transparency.    An aerial view of the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. (© Jason Reed / Reuters/REUTERS)    Trump\\'s decision might already have taken effect, as a U.S. drone reportedly attacked two men in a town on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan earlier this month. The Defense Department did not take responsibility for the strike as it typically would. A spokeswoman for the department could not immediately be reached for comment. Anders, the ACLU director, charged that such ambiguity can have dangerous consequences. \"The CIA should be a foreign intelligence gathering and analysis organization — not a paramilitary one,\" he said.

(Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP)   In his final months in office, President Barack Obama sought to lock in a structure and set of rules governing targeted killings and drone strikes so that the in\\xadcred\\xadibly lethal tool would not be abused by his successors. In his first six weeks in office, President Trump, who has made destroying the Islamic State his top foreign policy priority, has pressed to roll back some of those checks. The Trump administration is close to finishing a review that would make it easier for the Pentagon to launch counterterrorism strikes anywhere in the world by lowering the threshold on acceptable civilian casualties and scaling back other constraints imposed by the Obama administration, senior U.S. officials said. The ongoing review, which is being considered at senior levels of the National Security Council, would undo a series of rules that Obama imposed, beginning in 2013, to rein in drone operations outside active war zones. The Trump review must still be approved by the president, but recent drafts of the new policy would represent a major change in the way the United States approaches drone strikes and other targeted-killing operations in places such as Yemen, Somalia and Libya. The changes to the Obama-era Presidential Policy Guidance would empower the Pentagon to make decisions on targets without approval from the White House and potentially scrap the “near-certainty” standard of no civilian deaths for strikes outside war zones. The Trump plans are also likely to relax the requirement that potential terror targets pose a “continuing and imminent threat” to U.S. personnel, officials said. A senior administration official said that the Trump White House remained committed to a standard above the minimum requirement mandated by the international law of armed conflict that governs most military operations. “Some standard above [that] is wise,” the official said. Obama imposed the restrictive rules because he was worried that future administrations might be seduced by the power of drones to destroy potential threats to the United States at a very low cost in both blood and taxpayer dollars anywhere in the world. He also hoped that his policy would provide a check internationally as armed drones proliferate, to countries such as China or Iran. “We have to create an architecture for this because [of] the potential for abuse,” Obama said in August during a speech. At the time, Obama said one of his goals before leaving office was to create an “internal structure” and “institutionalized process” that would restrict his successors. Now it is likely that Trump will move to lift many of those Obama-era restrictions, making it easier for the U.S. military to strike potential terror targets anywhere in the world. Senior U.S. officials said Trump is almost certain to back changes that would shift final approval for individual strikes from the White House back to the Pentagon and the CIA, where they resided before the new rules were imposed. The current Obama-era constraints require the Defense Department and CIA to provide overall plans for killing or detaining individual high-value terrorism targets to the president for approval. The extra layer of bureaucracy was designed to ensure that the Pentagon and CIA were abiding by the White House-mandated constraints and that there was a consensus within the U.S. government on both the need to kill the target and the potential diplomatic blowback of an errant strike. But some critics, particularly in the Pentagon and CIA, have said that centralizing the process in the White House created an approval bottleneck that has made it harder to hit potentially fleeting targets who are not already on the White House’s kill list. “We are seeking ways to accelerate our operations against terror groups, and be more nimble and agile in our speed of response,” said Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis. “But we always will maintain a commitment to minimizing, avoiding civilian casualties.” The move to streamline the process and delegate decision-making would also free up the White House to consider larger issues, such as its overall strategy in places such as Yemen, Libya and Somalia. Those broader strategic discussions under Obama often took a back seat to debating and approving terror targets, critics said. “A big goal is getting the White House out of the way of itself,” said a senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration debates. “The president believes too much has been centralized in the White House, and he wants to push decisions down to the agencies.” The White House is also weighing whether to relax or change the current standard on civilian casualties, which demands near-certainty that no civilians are killed or injured in U.S. raids or drone strikes outside conflict zones. One possibility being considered could demand a near-certainty that no women or children are killed, but impose a different standard for military-age males. Or the White House could choose to waive the more stringent rules in certain geographical areas for certain periods of time. But the senior Trump administration official said any new policy will acknowledge that any civilian casualties overseas work against U.S. counterterrorism policy goals. “ We want to have a wise, moral standard that allows us to maintain the consent of the governed in these countries,” the official said. The Obama White House touted the precision of U.S. drone operations in a report last summer, concluding that a range of 64 to 116 civilians had been killed in drone strikes or other lethal air attacks outside established war zones. Independent groups that track civilian deaths have estimated civilian death rates that are two or three times those figures. In a letter released Friday, 37 former top U.S. officials, most of whom served in the Obama administration, urged Trump to move cautiously when modifying or overturning restrictions imposed in recent years. On the issue of civilian casualties, the signatories pressed Trump to stick with the current approach. “Even small numbers of unintentional civilian deaths or injuries .\\u2009.\\u2009. can cause significant setbacks,” the letter warned. The final area that the Trump White House seems likely to scrap is a standard that potential terror targets outside war zones pose a continuing and imminent threat to Americans. “It’s not clear whether that’s a reasonable standard,” said a U.S. counterterrorism official who has been involved in the discussions. “Of all the mandates, that might be the most vulnerable.” Both the Trump and Obama administrations have pursued an approach to counterterrorism that seeks, wherever possible, to work through local indigenous partners. Such a strategy is cheaper and also helps keep American forces out of harm’s way. But the requirement that U.S. officials prove a continuing and imminent threat to American citizens has made it much harder to provide air or drone support to U.S. allies when they are under fire from groups such as the Islamic State or al-Qaeda in places such as Yemen, Libya and Somalia. For Obama, the high standard ensured that local partner forces did not come to depend on American air support and that the U.S. military did not inadvertently slide down a slippery slope into larger-scale combat operations or even war. The downside of such an approach is that it often left beleaguered U.S. allies feeling bitter and betrayed when their far more powerful American partner declined to provide potentially lifesaving assistance. “How much are we supporting our partners if we are only saying that we will take a strike if there’s a continuing and imminent threat to U.S. persons?” said Luke Hartig, a former senior director for counterterrorism in the Obama administration and a fellow at the New American Foundation. Said another senior U.S. official: “Essentially we are saying to allies that we’ll only use our fancy tools when it’s our butts on the line.” The Trump administration has been weighing several alternatives to the continuing-and-imminent-threat standard. One lower standard being considered would require the Pentagon or intelligence agencies to prove that potential targets perform a “key leadership function” for al-Qaeda or an affiliated group. Another possibility would require U.S. officials to demonstrate that the target’s death would result in a “material setback” for the terror group, said the U.S. counterterrorism official. “There are lots of options to consider here,” the official said.   \\nDuring a speech on Long Island on Friday, President Donald Trump took a break from discussing gang violence and illegal immigration to give the law enforcement officers gathered for his remarks some advice on how to treat suspects.\\n\"When you guys put somebody in the car and you\\'re protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over?\" Trump said, miming the physical motion of an officer shielding a suspect\\'s head to keep it from bumping against the squad car.\\n\"Like, don\\'t hit their head, and they just killed somebody - don\\'t hit their head,\" Trump continued. \"I said, you can take the hand away, OK?\"\\nThese remarks, coming after Trump talked about towns ravaged by gang violence and described \"these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon,\" met with applause from at least some of the law enforcement officers gathered for his speech at Suffolk County Community College in New York.\\nA group of uniform officers standing behind Trump applauded, and, when he turned to face them, some smiled and appeared to chuckle.\\nIn response to a question regarding Trump\\'s comments and the officers who applauded, the Suffolk County police quickly distanced the department from Trump\\'s comments, saying Friday that they would not accept this treatment of people in custody.\\n\"The Suffolk County Police Department has strict rules and procedures relating to the handling of prisoners, and violations of those rules and procedures are treated extremely seriously,\" the department said in an emailed statement. \"As a department, we do not and will not tolerate \\'rough[ing]\\' up prisoners.\"\\nTrump\\'s remarks also drew a rebuke from the International Association of Chiefs of Police. In a statement, the group did not specifically mention Trump by name but appeared to respond to his speech by stressing the importance of treating all people, including suspects, with respect.\\n\"Managing use of force is one of the most difficult challenges faced by law enforcement agencies,\" the group said. \"The ability of law enforcement officers to enforce the law, protect the public, and guard their own safety, the safety of innocent bystanders, and even those suspected or apprehended for criminal activity is very challenging.\\n\"For these reasons, law enforcement agencies develop policies and procedures, as well as conduct extensive training, to ensure that any use of force is carefully applied and objectively reasonable considering the situation confronted by the officers,\" the statement continued.\\nTrump\\'s comments were made during a dark, foreboding address largely focusing on the transnational gang MS-13. He also peppered his speech with expressions of support for police, echoing his efforts both during and since the presidential campaign to portray himself as a champion of law enforcement.\\nThese remarks were condemned by civil rights and advocacy groups. Vanita Gupta, who ran the Justice Department\\'s civil rights division during the Obama administration, decried the comments and said they ran counter to efforts from local police agencies to repair relationships with their communities.\\n\"Trump\\'s remarks today are unconscionable,\" Gupta, who is now president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said in a statement. \"The President of the United States, standing before an audience of law enforcement officials, actively encouraged police violence. His remarks undermine the positive efforts of local law enforcement agencies and communities around the country working to address police misconduct and build community-police trust.\"\\nJanai Nelson, the associate director-counsel NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said Trump\\'s comments \"encouraging police officers to disregard the safety of individuals in their custody rises to a new level of danger.\"\\n\"We need law enforcement who do not share the Trump Administration\\'s outdated and unlawful views to promote protecting the rights and safety of all Americans by condemning those who condone impunity among law enforcement,\" Nelson said in a statement.\\nThe American Civil Liberties Union posted on Twitter that Trump was \"urging lawlessness\" with his speech.\\nTrump has previously encouraged violent behavior during public remarks, particularly during his raucous presidential campaign rallies. At a November 2015 rally in Alabama, Trump said that a protester was loud and \"maybe he should have been roughed up.\"\\nDuring another campaign rally in Michigan, Trump said he would defend in court anyone who hurt a protester being escorted out. When a protester interrupted a Las Vegas rally, Trump said \"guys like that\" used to be \"carried out in a stretcher,\" adding: \"I\\'d like to punch him in the face, I tell ya.\" At another rally, Trump said protesters were being removed too slowly because \"nobody wants to hurt each other anymore.\"\\nWith his comments Friday, Trump appeared to encourage police officers not to worry about using excessive force during arrests.\\nOfficers can be arrested and charged with excessive force, facing charges on both a local and federal level. Several Suffolk County police officers were indicted last year and accused of beating a suspect after he was arrested in 2012. In November, a week before Trump was elected, the former Suffolk County police chief was sentenced to 46 months in prison after pleading guilty to a federal civil rights violation and conspiring to obstruct justice; authorities said he beat a man handcuffed and in police custody.\\nThe Justice Department said its investigations of unconstitutional behavior by law enforcement officers most frequently involve allegations of excessive force. If a person alleging excessive force has been arrested or detained, federal officials must prove that an officer used more force \"than is reasonably necessary to arrest or gain control of the victim,\" the Justice Department states.\\nIn 2016, a former Las Vegas police officer was charged with violating the civil rights of an unnamed person by using excessive force during an arrest; the indictment specifically notes that among other things, the officer slammed the person\\'s head into the door of his police car.\\nSuch charges have continued during the Trump administration. Last month, the Justice Department announced that three current and former Florida police officers had been indicted in connection with the assault of a car passenger during a traffic stop. Officers charged with using excessive force during arrests have also faced charges of making false statements about what unfolded.\\nExcessive force lawsuits can also be costly for local governments. Last month, a $225,000 settlement was reached in the case of a Pennsylvania man who said he was shocked with a Taser after arguing with an officer during his arrest. In 2015, a $1 million settlement was reached in a case involving a California sheriff\\'s deputy accused of using excessive force on a man with Down syndrome.\\nTrump and his administration have offered a defense of law enforcement officers in the face of what they have portrayed as an anti-police mentality. Attorney General Jeff Sessions tied a recent increase in violent crime to \"undermined\" respect for police.\\nSessions\\'s Justice Department has also launched a review of all police-reform agreements in place nationwide, pacts that remain a key legacy of former president Barack Obama\\'s administration. Such agreements are typically reached after expansive federal civil rights investigations, such as the probe of the Chicago police, released days before Trump took office, which determined that officers there routinely use excessive force and violate the rights of residents.\\nBefore he was confirmed, Sessions said that consent decrees forcing reforms on departments can \"undermine the respect for police officers.\" In April, the Justice Department said that officials would review all existing agreements to ensure they do not work against the Trump administration\\'s goals of fighting violent crime while protecting officer safety and morale. Police departments have vowed to continue pushing for reforms.\\nDuring his speech Friday, Trump also returned to a familiar theme for him: invoking, and questioning, the levels of violence in Chicago. Speaking in New York, Trump appeared to tell a variation on a story he shared last year about an unnamed \"top police officer\" in the city who could stop the bloodshed there in a matter of days.\\n      Sign up for the daily Inside Washington email for exclusive US coverage and analysis sent to your inbox Get our free Inside Washington email    The team planning Donald Trump\\'s inauguration was \"seriously considering adding military vehicles\" to the parade through Washington DC in January. The Presidential inauguration committee asked the Pentagon to \"send us some pictures of military vehicles we could add to the parade\", a confidential email released under transparency laws showed. But the defence official responding to the request was \"extremely reluctant\" to produce the list and told the committee \"such support would be out of guidelines\", according to the Huffington Post. The Pentagon could also have asked to have the costs associated with bringing the vehicles into the capital reimbursed, the official wrote. According to the email, the \"establishing guidance\" for the request came \"from the highest level\". Mr Trump has previously said: \"Being a great president has to do with a lot of things, but one of them is being a great cheerleader for the country. \"And we’re going to show the people as we build up our military, we’re going to display our military. \"That military may come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. That military may be flying over New York City and Washington DC for parades. I mean, we’re going to be showing our military.\" A call to the White House press office from The Independent went unanswered on Wednesday night.  \\n\\t\\nDonald Trump\\'s archive interviews with Howard Stern have revealed a number of embarrassing and horrifying quotes once uttered by the now-President of the United States, including his rating of a number of Hollywood actresses. However, the most shocking tale of them all comes from a July 2008 tape in which Trump reveals that he once turned away from an 80-year-old man who had fallen off a stage and hit his head.\\nThe story came about as he was discussing his uneasiness for looking at blood, which prompted him to recall the incident. His story makes for uncomfortable reading.\\n \"I was at Mar-a-Lago and we had this incredible ball, the Red Cross Ball, in Palm Beach, Florida. \\n And we had the Marines. And the Marines were there, and it was terrible because all these rich people, they\\'re there to support the Marines, but they\\'re really there to get their picture in the Palm Beach Post. \\n So, you have all these really rich people, and a man, about 80 years old - very wealthy man, a lot of people didn\\'t like him - he fell off the stage... \\n So what happens is, this guy falls off right on his face, hits his head, and I thought he died. \\n And you know what I did? I said, \\'Oh my God, that\\'s disgusting,\\' and I turned away. \\n I couldn\\'t, you know, he was right in front of me and I turned away. I didn\\'t want to touch him. He\\'s bleeding all over the place, I felt terrible. \\n You know, beautiful marble floor, didn\\'t look like it. It changed colour. Became very red. \\n And you have this poor guy, 80 years old, laying on the floor unconscious, and all the rich people are turning away... \\n    What happens is, these 10 Marines from the back of the room. \\n They come running forward, they grab him, they put the blood all over the place—it\\'s all over their uniforms—they\\'re taking it, they\\'re swiping [it], they ran him out, they created a stretcher. \\n They call it a human stretcher, where they put their arms out with, like, five guys on each side... \\n I was saying, \\'Get that blood cleaned up! It\\'s disgusting!\\' The next day, I forgot to call [the man] to say is he OK. \\n It\\'s just not my thing.\" \\nYou can listen to the whole interview, courtesy of  The Daily Beast, here . \\n LISTEN TO THE INTERVIEW \\n  Sign up to the free weekly newsletter for more from Harper\\'s Bazaar straight to your inbox \\n SIGN UP \\n\\t \\n“Before being elected President, Mr. Trump was one of the most successful businessmen in the world with a responsibility to his company, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,” The White House said in a statement. “That being said, Mr. Trump paid $38 million dollars even after taking into account large scale depreciation for construction, on an income of more than $150 million dollars, as well as paying tens of millions of dollars in other taxes such as sales and excise taxes and employment taxes and this illegally published return proves just that.”\\nWhile initially promising to release his returns ahead of the 2016 election, Trump hedged and then resisted repeated calls to do so during the campaign. Trump has argued that his taxes are under audit by the IRS — and said that he would be happy to release them after the audit was complete. There are no IRS rules that prohibit someone from releasing their tax returns publicly while they are under audit. \\nBy refusing to release his returns, Trump eschewed decade of precedent — every candidate since 1976 had released their returns, when former President Gerald Ford released only summary data. \\nThe new documents, which were posted online and broadcast on MSNBC, show Trump and his wife Melania paid $5.3 million in standard federal income tax and more than $31 million in the alternative minimum tax. The Alternative Minimum Tax is intended to prevent taxpayers from excessively reducing their tax liabilities by taking many or sizable deductions.\\nTrump has proposed eliminating the AMT as part of an overhaul of the tax code. \\nJohnston is a former reporter for The New York Times who won a Pulitzer prize for his coverage of the tax system. He runs a web site, dcreport.org, which crashed soon after he posted the tax documents. \\nThe purported tax documents, which were aired live on MSNBC, bore a stamp that read “Client copy.” Johnston said the documents were sent to him, but said he did not know where they came from. At one point, as he spoke to Maddow, Johnston seemed to imply that Trump himself may have sent him the returns. \\n“It’s entirely possible Donald (Trump) sent this to me,” he added. “Donald has a long history of leaking material himself.”\\nIn the run up to their publishing, Maddow created an Internet frenzy — hyping them on Twitter and setting off more than an hour of speculation. But the documents, which were incomplete, were short of salacious revelations. \\nAccording to the document, Trump earned about $150 million, including some $32 million in capital gains.\\nBut he reported a $100 million loss he was able to subtract from that. MSNBC only released the first two pages of the return, and it’s impossible to tell from them what produced that loss.\\nTrump’s adjusted gross income was $48.5 million that year. He took $17 million in itemized deductions against that, though, again, the documents do not detail speifics. Among the likely candidates: a deduction for state and local taxes important to high-tax states like New York.\\nThat left Trump with about $31.5 million in taxable income, and his regular income tax on that was about $5.3 million.\\nBut the alternative minimum tax, which was designed to prevent the wealthy from ducking the tax man, forced Trump to pay an additional $31.2 million in taxes.\\n“If it weren’t for the AMT, he’d pay a very, very low tax rate,” said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center.\\nMany lawmakers, like Trump, have called for eliminating the AMT, which critics say is overly complicated.\\nTrump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., seemed to revel in the — in relative terms — mundane nature of the revelations, tweeting: “Thank you Rachel Maddow for proving to your #Trump hating followers how successful @realDonaldTrump is & that he paid $40mm in taxes!”\\nStill, fresh information on Trump’s taxes has been relatively rare. \\nIn October, at the height the 2016 presidential campaign, The New York Times obtained and published three pages of Trump’s 1995 state tax returns, which showed he took a deduction of $916 million on losses, which could have allowed him to avoid paying taxes for 18 years. \\nWhile it’s not unusual that Trump would use that tax break, the losses he claimed were so large they amounted to almost 2 percent of all such deductions claimed that year by taxpayers.\\nIn June 2016, POLITICO reported that Trump likely paid no taxes for at least two years in the 1990s. The Washington Post has also previously reported that Trump paid no taxes in 1978 and 1979. \\nTuesday’s Trump tax news also shared some details with the earlier Times report: Both of the scoops arrived in the mail.\\nIn the same way New York Times reporter Susanne Craig got her hands on Trumps 1995 tax records In September, Johnston said someone just mailed him Trump’s 2005 1040 tax form. \\n“It came in the mail over the transom,” Johnston said on MSNBC. \\nJohnson did not immediately respond to a Twitter message seeking comment to why he chose to break the story on MSBNC. \\nToby Eckert, Hadas Gold, Brian Faler and Cristiano Lima contributed to this report.   \\n  \\nThe New York Times: Digital and Home Delivery Subscriptions\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Offer for a New York Times News subscription; current subscribers not eligible.

On top of that, he’s one of the most generous celebrities in the world with a heart filled with more gold than his $100 million New York penthouse.\\nIn 2004, the first season of “The Apprentice” aired and at that time I worked as an entertainment columnist for the “Chicago Tribune.” I had a gut feeling that Chicago contestant, Bill Rancic, was going to win the reality show. So I contacted him and managed to score an invite to New York for the show’s grand finale. This is where I first met Trump and got to ask him a few questions. \\n Since the media has failed so miserably at reporting the truth about Trump, I decided to put together some of the acts of kindness he’s committed over three decades which has gone virtually unnoticed or fallen on deaf ears. \\n In 1986, Trump prevented the foreclosure of Annabelle Hill’s family farm after her husband committed suicide. Trump personally phoned down to the auction to stop the sale of her home and offered the widow money. Trump decided to take action after he saw Hill’s pleas for help in news reports.\\n In 1988, a commercial airline refused to fly Andrew Ten, a sick Orthodox Jewish child with a rare illness, across the country to get medical care because he had to travel with an elaborate life-support system. His grief stricken parents contacted Trump for help and he didn’t hesitate to send his own plane to take the child from Los Angeles to New York so he could get his treatment.\\n In 1991, 200 Marines who served in Operation Desert Storm spent time at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina before they were scheduled to return home to their families. However, the Marines were told that a mistake had been made and an aircraft would not be able to take them home on their scheduled departure date. \\nWhen Trump got wind of this, he sent his plane to make two trips from North Carolina to Miami to safely return the Gulf War Marines to their loved ones.\\n In 1995, a motorist stopped to help Trump after the limo he was traveling in got a flat tire. Trump asked the Good Samaritan how he could repay him for his help. All the man asked for was a bouquet of flowers for his wife. A few weeks later Trump sent the flowers with a note that read: “We’ve paid off your mortgage.”\\n In 1996, Trump filed a lawsuit against the city of Palm Beach, Florida accusing the town of discriminating against his Mar-a-Lago resort club because it allowed Jews and blacks. Abraham Foxman, who was the Anti-Defamation League Director at the time, said Trump “put the light on Palm Beach – not on the beauty and the glitter, but on its seamier side of discrimination.” \\nFoxman also noted that Trump’s charge had a trickle-down effect because other clubs followed his lead and began admitting Jews and blacks.\\n In 2000, Maury Povich featured a little girl named Megan who struggled with Brittle Bone Disease on his show and Trump happened to be watching. Trump said the little girl’s story and positive attitude touched his heart. So he contacted Maury and gifted the little girl and her family with a very generous check.\\n In 2008, after Jennifer Hudson’s family members were tragically murdered in Chicago, Trump put the Oscar-winning actress and her family up at his Windy City hotel for free. In addition to that, Trump’s security took extra measures to ensure Hudson and her family members were safe during such a difficult time.\\n In 2013, New York bus driver Darnell Barton spotted a woman close to the edge of a bridge staring at traffic below as he drove by. He stopped the bus, got out and put his arm around the woman and saved her life by convincing her to not jump. When Trump heard about this story, he sent the hero bus driver a check simply because he believed his good deed deserved to be rewarded.\\n In 2014, Trump gave $25,000 to Sgt. Andrew Tamoressi after he spent seven months in a Mexican jail for accidentally crossing the US-Mexico border. President Barack Obama couldn’t even be bothered to make one phone call to assist with the United States Marine’s release; however, Trump opened his pocketbook to help this serviceman get back on his feet.\\n In 2016, Lynne Patton, a black female executive for the Trump Organization, released a statement defending her boss against accusations that he’s a racist and a bigot. She tearfully revealed how she’s struggled with substance abuse and addiction for years. Instead of kicking her to the curb, she said the Trump Organization and his entire family loyally stood by her through “immensely difficult times.”\\n Trump’s kindness knows no bounds and his generosity has and continues to touch the lives of people from every sex, race and religion. When Trump sees someone in need, he wants to help.\\n  \\nTwo decades ago, Oprah asked Trump in a TV interview if he’d run for president. He said: “If it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally, because I really am tired of seeing what’s happening with this country.”\\nThat day has come. Trump sees that America is in need, And, he wants to help – how “unthinkable!”\\n\\t  President Donald Trump blasted the media again Friday morning, dedicating the first 13 minutes of his speech to the annual Conservative Political Action Conference to criticizing the press and its sources. The president repeated his claim that the press is often \"the enemy of the American People\" and demanded that reporters stop using unnamed sources — which the president claims don\\'t exist.     \"They have no sources they just make them up when there are none,\" Trump told the at-capacity CPAC crowd who cheered him in agreement. \"They shouldn\\'t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody\\'s name. Let their name be put out there.\" The president\\'s demand for reporters to name sources came just hours after White House officials held a briefing with reporters to discuss Chief of Staff Reince Preibus\\' conversations with FBI officials regarding a New York Times story about Trump campaign communications with Russia. Administration officials in that briefing agreed to only be quoted on background, not identified by name.  Related: Trump Aide Reince Priebus Asked FBI to Knock Down Russia Stories   While Trump pressed for named sources as the standard for reporters, he has not actually met that standard himself. Trump has used unnamed sources multiple times on Twitter, specifically to bolster his birther campaign against former President Barack Obama. In the final months of the 2016 campaign, Trump conceded that \"President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period,\" but took no questions about why he changed his mind on the issue and why he pushed the conspiracy theory in the first place. In 2012, Trump alleged that Obama\\'s birth certificate was \"a fraud\" — providing no evidence other than the information of \"extremely credible sources.\" The president\\'s sources weren\\'t used only in relation to the president\\'s birth certificate, but to call the system \"rigged\" when \"sources\" announced that no charges would be brought by the FBI against Hillary Clinton. But within weeks, Trump was again lashing out against unnamed sources — advising his Twitter followers in September 2016 \"DO NOT believe\" stories that cite \"source.\" Hours later he added: \"if they don\\'t name the sources, the sources don\\'t exist.\" Bringing the point home Friday to the CPAC crowd, Trump painted the media as \"very smart, very cunning, and very dishonest\" and advocated for exposing \"their false stories.\" \"No one loves the First Amendment more than me,\" the president said before again making an us-versus-them claim that media corporations \"have their own agenda and its not your agenda.\" \"We\\'re gonna do something about it,\" Trump vowed.

And no, we’re not talking about Barack Obama. In a new television interview with Sweden’s SVT, the British treasure recounts the time Donald Trump called her up to ask her out. The recently divorced Thompson says she was in her trailer on set when a call came through, and the man on the other end announced himself by saying, “Hi. This is Donald Trump here,” and proceeded to offer her unsolicited lodging: “I wondered if I could offer you some accommodation in my Trump Towers. They’re very comfortable.” Waving his real-estate holdings around as a kind of come-on sounds like a very Donald Trump thing to do, so we’re inclined to believe the call happened as Thompson described. When she asked why she would need a place to stay when she already has one, Trump apparently responded, “Well you know, I think we would get on very well. Maybe we could have dinner sometime.” At that point, Thompson politely extricated herself from the call, and from the course of American political history.\\n \\n \\n \\n Emma Thompson Once Got Asked Out by Donald Trump\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n  When you get married, all eyes are normally on you.

Trump was having dinner upstairs, and popped in for a few minutes to take pictures with the bride and groom in the library.

Trump RSVPed saying he’d try to stop by and he did, even bringing along Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for a photo op. He even gave a speech later in the night, noting that the bride’s family “paid me a fortune” as club members.  Both couples had to deal with increased security because of Trump’s presence. In New Jersey, Secret Service was on the property, and in Florida, the couple had to change a lot of their plans to deal with increased security.

The “Love Actually” star turned him down. Thompson told a Swedish television talk show that the bizarre incident happened while she was filming the 1998 movie “Primary Colors” in California, as she and actor Kenneth Branagh were finalizing their divorce. One day, Thompson said, the phone rang in her movie set trailer. “So I lift up the phone — ‘Hi, it’s Donald Trump here,’” Thompson recalled on SVT’s “Skavlan” show on Thursday. “And I said, ‘Really? Can I help you?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, I just wondered if I could offer you some accommodation in one of my Trump Towers. They’re really comfortable.” Thompson, who had never met or spoken with the then New York businessman, was confused and asked why. “‘Well, I think we would get along very well — maybe have dinner sometime,’” Thompson, now 57, recalled Trump saying. Thompson said she “didn’t know what to do with myself. I just said, ‘I’ll get back to you.’”. She never did, and said she has never met Trump since. By Thompson’s account, the phone call would have taken place around the time of Trump’s separation from his second wife, Marla Maples. He married his third wife, the current U.S. first lady, Melania Trump, in 2005. The White House had no immediate response to Thompson’s story.

What followed next is a pretty incredible story.  It was the late 1990s, and Thompson was doing a film called Primary Colors with John Travolta, the British actress said during an interview for Swedish news outlet  SVT(Opens in a new tab). \\nThompson, who at the time was freshly divorced from Kenneth Branagh, received the call from The Donald while on her trailer on the Universal Studios lot.  After the initial shock, Trump reportedly said: \"Yeah, I just you know, I wondered if I could offer you some accommodation in one of my Trump Towers. They’re really comfortable.\" The actress recalls being confused by the offer. Once Trump\\'s intentions became clear -- \"Well, you know, I think we would get on very well -- maybe we could have dinner sometime,\" he reportedly said -- Thompson kindly turned down the offer.  “I just said, ‘O.K. well, um, I’ll get back to you. Thank you so much for the offer,’\" she said. But now she kind of regrets it. Just watch it. \\n \\n  Emma Thompson has revealed that President Donald Trump once asked her out for dinner, and even offered to accommodate her at one of his Trump Towers. The  Love Actually  star made the shocking revelation during an interview on the Swedish news outlet SVT. She told the other guests that the incident happened while shooting the movie Primary Colors with John Travolta in the 1990s, shortly after her divorce from actor Kenneth Branagh. As Thompson tells it, one day she was in her trailer when the phone rang. “I look at it and it’s like weird, like a moose has entered,” she joked. “I lift up the phone [and hear] ‘Hi, it’s Donald Trump here.’ I say ‘Really? Can I help you?,’ and he says ‘I wonder if I can offer you some accommodation in one of my Trump Towers, they’re really comfortable?’ Thompson, who is now married to English actor and producer Greg Wise, said after asking the now-President why he was offering her somewhere to stay, Trump responded: “Why you know, I think we would get on very well. Maybe we could have dinner some time?” “I didn’t know what to do with myself,” the Saving Mr Banks actress admitted. “I was on my own and just said ‘Um, OK, I’ll get back to you. Thank you so much for the offer’.” After recovering from the shock revelation, the SVT joked that Thompson could be the first lady. “You could have stopped him,” added one of the guests.

The man has spent much of his 80-some years finding outrageously strange and clever ways to bamboozle the media. In 1959, when he was a young man, Abel founded the Society for Indecency to Naked Animals. The group\\'s slogan: \"A nude horse is a rude horse.\" The organization, which declared it a matter of moralistic urgency to make dogs and horses and other animals wear pants, was a joke, but the Today show (among other media outlets) took the bait. \"Even Walter Cronkite believed it,\" Abel says. \"About putting Marina shorts on horses and a mumu on a cow. That should be a tip right there. A red flag. \\'What do you mean you want to put a mumu on a cow?\\'\" Since then, Abel has typically been described as a \"prankster\" or a \"media hoaxer.\" His career far precedes The Onion, Facebook hoaxes and Sacha Baron Cohen. During the 1970s, with help from some collaborators, Abel fooled reporters into believing that a hired actor was the Watergate informant Deep Throat—and in 1980, he executed his greatest hoax to date: He died. Well, not actually. He faked his own death from a heart attack. He even fooled The New York Times into publishing a premature obituary, then re-emerged, very much alive, at a press conference the day after the obit ran. He\\'s alive still today. He\\'s probably 86. But nobody talks about \"fake news\" more obsessively than Donald Trump, and 22 years ago, the two men first clunked heads. It was 1994. The setting was a New York book fair. Fifth Avenue was closed to vehicle traffic. The sidewalks were flowing with book stands. Abel set up a stand to sell his own books on the sidewalk in front of Trump Tower. Sales were good. He was soon confronted by a security detail from the Trump building. \"Three of his security guards looked like linebackers with the Giants,\" Abel recalls. \"They said, \\'You move, or we\\'ll move you.\\'\" The guards informed Abel that the sidewalk in front of Trump Tower is owned by Trump. Abel retorted that it\\'s public property. \"They disagreed,\" Abel says, \"and gave me five minutes to move my books.\" A retired cop overheard the dispute and came to Abel\\'s defense, saying that the sidewalk is owned by the city of New York, not Trump. No matter. The guards were ready to get physical, so Abel packed up and moved. Abel sued and took his grievance to Small Claims Court in Manhattan. He brought with him a witness: the retired policeman who corroborated that Abel had been ordered to move from public property. The good news: He won. \"It was a default judgment. Trump wasn\\'t there to protest it,\" he says. \"Because Trump never answers a lawsuit less than 10 grand usually, and even then he\\'ll settle over the phone for something less.\" The bad news: Trump never paid up. Abel found it perplexingly difficult to get his money, in part because Trump owns and runs more than 200 distinct corporations, and he needed to identify the correct one to collect his $900. \"I\\'d have to figure out the correct one and where the bank is and get an order to serve for the money, plus interest,\" Abel gripes. \"You have to go through a lot of red tape to do things like that. That\\'s why he doesn\\'t worry about getting sued—because he knows he can defeat anybody just with the paperwork.\" For decades, Abel has kept up the fight to obtain a sum of money that, for Trump, is essentially laundry change. (Though Trump\\'s dirty laundry seems more expensive than other presidents\\'.) \"I\\'ve written probably a dozen letters to Trump\\'s legal department. And they don\\'t respond, usually. I keep badgering.\" About 12 years ago, Abel traveled to Atlantic City, showed his judgment to the local sheriff and ordered the guy to auction off Trump\\'s Taj Mahal casino: Abel would keep the first $900 and give Trump the rest of the millions.    \\nAlan Abel, pictured in the late 1950s or early 1960s, was the mastermind behind the satirical Society for Indecency to Naked Animals (SINA).\\nAbel Family Archive\\n  Abel doesn\\'t even live in New York anymore. He\\'s decamped to central Connecticut. His sense of humor remains devilishly sharp. In a spate of recent conversations with Newsweek, he sounded as chipper and witty as ever (he seems to end every conversation with \"Onwards and upwards!\"), though distressed by the state of politics under President Trump. \"It\\'s gonna be the Old West again,\" he muses. \"I\\'m serious about going to Canada maybe for a couple of years if possible and not having to deal with all the wrath and all the anxieties people have. Especially road rage. I think that\\'s the worst thing. I won\\'t let my wife touch the horn in my car when we drive. She\\'s very impatient, and she likes to honk. And I said, \\'No more!\\'\"   Related: Is Donald Trump really just Andy Kaufman in disguise? An investigation   Abel\\'s wife, Jeanne Abel, has been more than a spectator to his pranks. During the 1960s, the couple collaborated on a long-running hoax: She pretended to be a fictitious presidential candidate named \"Yetta Bronstein.\" In 1964, the Abels duped about 20 people into marching in support of Bronstein outside the Democratic National Convention. Years later, Jeanne played along when her husband played dead. That particular hoax earned Abel the admiration of Andy Kaufman, the eccentric performance artist whose fans often insist is still alive after faking his own death in 1984. Some fans have even latched onto the crackpot theory that Kaufman has transformed himself into an outrageous character of his own creation: Donald Trump. Abel has expressed delight at the thought that Trump is his old friend Kaufman in disguise. Indeed, that revelation would make it much easier for him to collect his $900. * * * Now, the obvious question: Is Abel for real? How do we know he\\'s not duping us? 2017 is not like 1959: It is easier than ever to fool the media, but it is also easier than ever to know when you are being fooled. Any journalist who searches Abel\\'s name would immediately disregard his claims. Even some old friends stopped speaking to him after that death hoax. \"To them, it\\'s a dirty trick,\" Abel says. \"You don\\'t fool around with death.\" Do you fool around with small claims court? Abel\\'s trickery is legendary, and his relationship with truth is...unorthodox. The man\\'s exact age, for instance, is a matter of some confusion. He now tells me he was born in 1930 and is now 86. Similarly, when he \"died,\" in 1980, he was reported to be 50 years old. But when I first spoke with Abel while reporting a different story in August, he insisted he was then 92, which either means he has a Benjamin Button–like condition that causes him to age in reverse or he lied about his age. (The New York Times profiled him in 2003 and noted that \"he declined to give his age last week because, he said, the request is \\'an invasion of privacy.\\'\" In December, though, Abel told me this: \"I\\'m in the 80s. That\\'s all I\\'ll admit to. My wife is in the 70s. She\\'s younger than I am. And I don\\'t have her chained in the attic.\") But Abel insists the $900 is not a gag. It does not seem like one of his gags. For one thing, the story is oddly specific and not very similar to Abel\\'s previous hoaxes, which tend toward the surreal (horses wearing underwear, people fainting en masse) and have more of a satirical bite. Plus, Abel says he is not interested in spreading political misinformation in the age of alternative facts. \"Everyone\\'s afraid of fake news these days. I can\\'t believe it,\" he says. \"[My] intent has been to amuse. Not to upset anybody in the Electoral College or whatnot.\" I requested proof. Abel offered to pull up the name of the retired officer who served as his witness, but he would have to sift through 50 storage boxes to find it. That would take time. Then, Abel coughed up some evidence: He emailed me the notice of judgment he received from the Civil Court of the City of New York. The document is dated December 28, 1994. It lists Trump Organization as the defendant. The space provided for an index number is left blank. That made me a bit suspicious. Abel successfully faked his own death, for Christ\\'s sake. He hired caterers and planned his own funeral. Surely, he could have managed to forge a document.    \\nThe notice of judgment that Alan Abel received from Small Clams Court in 1994.\\nAlan Abel\\n  I saw only one way to confirm: I needed to call the Civil Court of the City of New York. I spent 20 minutes on the phone with several automated bots, none of whom were willing to connect me with a human or comment on a piece of paperwork that is older than Hailee Steinfeld. (I also reached out to the Trump Organization inquring about the judgment, but have not yet received a response.) I saw one more way to confirm: I needed to journey deep into the bureaucratic catacombs of the New York County courts system. That is how, late on a Friday afternoon, I found myself poking around the grim-looking basement of the New York State Supreme Court Building. Following the advice of an employee in the county clerk\\'s office, I entered a musty, old room filled with stacks and stacks of moldy books of records dating back to the 1920s or so. A clerk scowled when I said I was a reporter. She said I wouldn\\'t find anything about the judgment there. I could head down the hall to another room filled with records (\"ask for Raphael\"), but it probably wasn\\'t there either. Or I could head down the street to 111 Centre Street: New York City Civil Court. She pointed to her watch. \"It\\'s 4:01,\" she said. \"They\\'re closing soon.\" I headed to New York City Civil Court. The small claims office is housed in a small room on the third floor of the New York City Civil Court. It is a cramped room filled with faded signs that say things like \"Please note: The person you are suing must be in New York City.\" The office reminded me a bit of the waiting room in  Beetlejuice , a bureaucratic purgatory peopled by lawyers and distressed individuals trying to collect whatever it is they\\'re owed. (But no shrunken heads.) I am not a lawyer or a distressed debtee, which might explain why the clerk—let\\'s call her Anna—eyed my request with friendly puzzlement and curiosity. Anna asked me to step aside and wait for the parade of lawyers dropping off paperwork to subside. Finally, the lawyers cleared out, and Anna agreed to search her computer records for Abel\\'s judgment. She warned me that the case was probably too old to be searchable, especially since I didn\\'t have the case number. She typed some names into her bulky computer, which also looked like it was from 1994. But then something remarkable happened: Abel\\'s name appeared. The judgment was—is—real! Anna beamed with excitement. She tilted the computer monitor to show me the record: Abel filed the suit on November 18, 1994. The notice was sent to Trump on November 25. The court date was set for December 28. The defendant, listed as \"Trump Organization,\" never showed up. The details of the case matched Abel\\'s story, as did the judgment in his favor: $900—or $919.58 with interest. The judge, Wilfred O\\'Connor, has been dead 20 years. There is no indication that Trump ever paid up. But these judgments often expire after 20 years, Anna said, which would make it hard for Abel to collect his money now that his debtor is the president. No matter: Abel was thrilled to hear of my findings. He wanted to take me to dinner to celebrate. He will just reopen the suit by suing Trump all over again, he says. \"You have to stand up and fight, and that\\'s my advice to people. I say, damn the torpedoes, full steam ahead. I think it was Admiral Perry that said that.... So onwards and upwards! Let\\'s organize a group. And we\\'ll march on Washington.\" Abel is confident he\\'ll finally get to collect his $900 during Trump\\'s presidency. Unless he dies first. But if you see an obituary, make sure it isn\\'t fake news. \\n   The grieving father\\xa0stood with his guitar and his cowboy hat in the cold, crowded lines for hours, driving to towns big and small in nearly every corner of the country. Beginning in\\xa0January\\xa02016,\\xa0Kraig Moss traveled to 45 rallies, belting out songs in support of Donald Trump and telling the story of his late son, Rob, who died three years ago from a heroin overdose. In this way, the musician earned the title of “the Trump Troubadour,” a true believer said to symbolize “the voice of unheard America.”  He stopped making his mortgage payments and sold\\xa0the equipment for his construction business to stay on the campaign trail,\\xa0galvanized by Trump’s promise to help young people — like Moss’s late son — who struggle with drug addiction. Trump, Moss thought, was the candidate most capable of bringing an end to the heroin epidemic sweeping the nation. Trump made this promise to Moss personally at a rally in Iowa in January 2016. Speaking through a microphone to the crowd, he\\xa0addressed\\xa0Moss directly: “The biggest thing we can do in honor of your son … we have to be able to stop it.” “I know what you went through. And he’s a great father,” he said of Moss to the crowd. “I can see it. And your son is proud of you.” But about two weeks ago, Moss caught his first glimpse of the Republican proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act.\\xa0The proposed\\xa0health care bill,\\xa0slated for floor vote in the House Thursday night, would eliminate a requirement that Medicaid cover basic mental-health and addiction services in states that expanded it, a mandate that covered nearly 1.3 million people. “This bill is just the absolute opposite,” Moss told The Washington Post. “I felt betrayed. I felt let down.” He had put all his weight behind the Republican’s\\xa0promise, sacrificing his business and his livelihood to sing Trump’s praises. But this bill backed by the president\\xa0“disgusted” him. He\\xa0no longer sings\\xa0songs about Trump, and he now wonders if any of\\xa0his sacrifices were worth it. “You hear that echo?” he said in a phone interview from his home in Upstate New York. “That’s because there’s no furniture in this house. It’s completely gutted.” “The\\xa0one platform that I was just so genuinely involved in with my heart was the one thing that he just turned right around,” Moss said. “He’s turning his back on all of us.” He had hoped to see provisions in the bill calling for boosted resources for addiction treatment centers, lower deductibles and lower overall health care costs. If Trump wanted to, Moss said, he could “wave his pen” and provide funding necessary to supply emergency responders in every small town in America with naloxone kits to reverse possible heroin overdoses. “Every one of those doses of Narcan represents a saved life,” Moss said. “If the emergency squad that came down to save my son had that dose, my son would’ve been alive today.” That day was\\xa0Jan 6, 2014. Moss, a single father,\\xa0came home from work and called out Rob’s name, like he always did. “I didn’t hear anything,” he recalled. In the basement bedroom downstairs, Moss found his\\xa024-year-old son lying\\xa0unconscious in bed with his arms resting across his chest. Next to him was the book he had just been reading, “The\\xa0Wise Man’s Fear.” Later, Moss\\xa0would find the needle. He called 911 and tried to revive his son through mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. An emergency response team arrived and was unable to bring him back. An autopsy\\xa0later confirmed the cause of death: an overdose of fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller up to 100 times stronger than morphine. Trump had told the father, “I know what you went through.” “We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth,” he said in his speech before Congress on Feb. 28, “and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.” Now, Moss said he wishes he could ask the president, “Have you even read the bill?” The health care proposal would roll back the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act\\xa0— commonly known as Obamacare — which would affect many states bearing the brunt of the opiate crisis, including Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia. The Republican overhaul\\xa0is spearheaded by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and backed by Trump. Republicans argue that the change would give states additional flexibility in coverage decisions, and believe they would continue to provide addiction and mental-health coverage to Medicaid recipients if needed. But advocates say the overhaul could be crushing for addiction treatment services, particularly for the poorest, most vulnerable patients.\\xa0A record number of people — 33,000 — died of opiate overdoses in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Pay close attention to what you tell people you’re going to do and make some kind of effort to follow through,” Moss said. “Pay more attention to the needs of the people.” Moss said he initially supported many of Trump’s other promises as well, such as his pledge to build a border wall with Mexico. But lately he has been upset\\xa0hearing the stories of families being separated by deportations. “If I contributed to anything like that I’d be ashamed of myself,” he said. Many have been criticizing Moss\\xa0for publicly\\xa0voicing his disappointment with Trump, but he knows there must be many others feeling similar pangs of regret or betrayal. “I was very instrumental in getting these ‘closet Trumpsters’ to come out” during the presidential\\xa0campaign, Moss\\xa0said. In a similar way, he hopes he can encourage other disillusioned Americans to speak up about their concerns with the new administration. “I’m not the lone ranger out here doing this,” he said. “It’s a little guy like me that put Trump in the office,” and it’s the “little guys” who can call lawmakers and ask for a new health care proposal, he said. “Don’t turn your head on this problem Mr. Trump,” Moss said.  More from Morning Mix    WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump has given the Central Intelligence Agency secret new authority to conduct drone strikes against suspected terrorists, U.S. officials said, changing the Obama administration’s policy of limiting the spy agency’s paramilitary role and reopening a turf war between the agency and the Pentagon. The new authority, which hadn’t been previously disclosed, represents a significant departure from a cooperative approach that had become standard practice by the end of former President Barack Obama’s tenure: The CIA used drones and other intelligence resources to locate suspected terrorists and then the military conducted the actual strike. The U.S. drone strike that killed Taliban leader Mullah Mansour in May 2016 in Pakistan was the best example of that hybrid approach, U.S. officials said. The Obama administration put the military in charge of pulling the trigger to promote transparency and accountability. The CIA, which operates under covert authorities, wasn’t required to disclose the number of suspected terrorists or civilian bystanders it killed in drone strikes. The Pentagon, however, must publicly report most airstrikes. Mr. Trump has indicated he wants to accelerate the fight against Islamic State and other militant groups. The CIA first used its new authority in late February in a strike on a senior al Qaeda leader in Syria, Abu al-Khayr al-Masri, U.S. officials said. The strike in northern Syria on Mr. Masri, a son-in-law of the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, had been reported, but it wasn’t previously known the CIA had carried it out under the new authority. U.S. officials are still assessing results of the strike. Spokesmen for the Pentagon and the CIA declined to comment.   Click for more from The Wall Street Journal      Donald Trump said the \"worst day\" of his life came when his marital troubles with then-wife Ivana Trump made headlines across the country and revealed his even more troubling financial straits, according to a new archive of nearly 15-hours of interviews he did over three decades with talk show host Howard Stern. The New York billionaire was nearing total bankruptcy when his relationship was also coming to an end. The pair, dubbed \"New York\\'s self-created imperial couple,\" kept their split as quiet as possible for about a month: while Donald camped out in one of Trump Tower\\'s apartment units, Ivana remained in the pair\\'s penthouse a few floors above. The future president would lie awake in bed, staring at the ceiling as his wife reportedly questioned his state of mind when speaking with her friends. Surely, it couldn\\'t get any worse—and then it did.  Newsweek exclusively obtained transcripts and audio of nearly 15 hours of Trump\\'s interviews with radio host Howard Stern from 1993 to August 25, 2015, provided by the new site Factba.se, which is archiving the entirety of Trump\\'s statements and speeches. The recordings provide a candid look at his rise from New York\\'s real estate industry to the most upper echelons of society and fame, detailing each pitfall and obstacle along the way.

Related: Trump Says He Groped Melania in Public, Ivanka Looks Down on Him, in Newly Released Recordings    An exchange he had with Stern in May 1993, just three years after his divorce, didn\\'t include the usual comedic banter. Instead, a more serious Trump was present, detailing how he almost lost everything, from his wife to his business empire, and how he managed to get her to agree to a $25 million divorce settlement.  Stern: So, you feel out of love with Ivana. Okay. You did a very honorable thing. You paid her $25 million for a divorce settlement.  Trump: That\\'s true.  Stern: That\\'s a lot of money.  Trump: A lot of money.  Stern: The time you were in financial trouble.  Trump: The deepest trouble of my life. Absolutely.  Stern: Were you truly in financial trouble?  Trump: Deep, deep trouble.  Stern: You were—they said that you were bankrupt, but within your corporation have been bankrupt. But you personally would not [inaudible].  Trump: They thought I might be bankrupt. They didn\\'t know. Nobody really understood. And perhaps I didn\\'t even understand, but I was—I was at a pretty low point in my life. This is about two years ago and since then a lot of great things have happened but at that point, that was the lowest financial point in life.  Stern: Could you have lost all of your personal money? I mean, could Donald Trump could—  Trump: I could have.  Stern: You could have been a working stiff. You know how embarrassing it would be to be like Donald Trump and going to work like a supermarket. He\\'s the vice president of a supermarket. That would have been embarrassing. True?  Trump: It could happen.  Stern: Could happen. You were really nervous. And yet you were able to put together 25 million—excuse me I spit on you, Donald.  Trump: That\\'s okay.  Stern: Twenty-five million dollars. I put together 25 million. You put together $25 million to pay your wife. And you said to your wife, by the way, you would gotten her to sign a prenuptial agreement. True?  Trump: That\\'s correct.  Stern: How the hell did you get her to sign a prenuptial agreement? A lot of guys out there want to know about this.  Trump: $25 million it\\'s easy.  Stern: But—but—but seriously, she knew that she could not have your empire. What\\'s the move there? How do you say, Hey, Ivana honey, sign this little agreement. How do you do it?  Trump: At that time, she was challenging the agreement. She was suing me for two and a half billion dollars. And when the times really hit low, at the lowest, at the worst day of my life: New York Times front page, Wall Street Journal front page, all of a sudden she [Ivana Trump] called up and she said, \"I\\'ll take the $25 million.\"   \\n \\n The former couple\\'s fractured relationship seemed to improve after their famously rocky divorce. Trump\\'s ex-wife told ABC News she was one of the former Republican candidate\\'s confidants during the campaign, and was advising him along the campaign trail. Trump has also said he doesn\\'t regret marrying Ivana, as the two remained close while raising his oldest children, Ivanka, Eric and Donald Trump Jr.   While Donald Trump has already made major moves to enact his strict anti-immigrant agenda, the president is reportedly deeply frustrated that he hasn’t been able to do more to close America’s borders to outsiders, and to expel those he feels have overstayed their welcome. In a shocking story Saturday, The New York Times cited two sources who described in explicit terms how Trump has raged against his advisers for not doing more to translate his nativist politics into policy. In an Oval Office meeting in July, the sources said, Trump read from a list in his hand during a discussion about immigrants who had been granted to enter the country. They “all have AIDS,” Trump reportedly said, referring to 15,000 Haitians that had obtained visas. The 40,000 Nigerians who had obtained visas would never “go back to their huts” in Africa, he fumed, according to the two officials—one who was at the meeting and another who heard about the comments from another person in attendance.  While the White House did not deny the overall description of the\\nmeeting, officials strenuously insisted that Mr. Trump never used the\\nwords “AIDS” or “huts” to describe people from any country. Several\\nparticipants in the meeting told Times reporters that they did not\\nrecall the president using those words and did not think he had, but\\nthe two officials who described the comments found them so noteworthy\\nthat they related them to others at the time.  Trump’s private rhetoric is not out of line with similarly inflammatory comments he has made publicly, such as when he referred to Mexican immigrants as drug dealers and “rapists” during his presidential campaign. Still, the remarks are notable in that they underscore Trump’s animus toward immigrants is personal as much as political—and that it is not shared by his closest advisers.  As the meeting continued, John F. Kelly, then the secretary of homeland security, and Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, tried to interject, explaining that many were short-term travelers making one-time visits. But as the president continued, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Miller turned their ire on Mr. Tillerson, blaming him for the influx of foreigners and prompting the secretary of state to throw up his arms in frustration. If he was so bad at his job, maybe he should stop issuing visas altogether, Mr. Tillerson fired back.   Tempers flared and Mr. Kelly asked that the room be cleared of staff members. But even after the door to the Oval Office was closed, aides could still hear the president berating his most senior advisers.  The White House denied the account of Kelly and Tillerson’s response, which a spokesperson called “outrageous.” But Trump’s own comments are familiar, even as they are shocking. The president has repeatedly seized on incidents of terrorism and violence worldwide to condemn U.S. immigration policy and to chide politicians to “get smart” about the threat. Earlier this month, Trump was condemned for sharing a series of anti-Muslim videos from a British far-right hate group. The month before, when a man who killed eight people in Manhattan was revealed to be originally from Uzbekistan, Trump bemoaned the air of complacency around immigration reform, calling current laws “a joke,” the Times reports. “We’re so politically correct,” he complained during a Cabinet meeting, “that we’re afraid to do anything.”  \\n\\n\\n \\n   \\nPresident Donald Trump on TV in Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on February 28. \\nYuri Gripas/Reuters\\n   Things are unraveling in the White House in the wake of a new scandal revealing that Donald Trump Jr., the president\\'s son and a campaign surrogate, arranged a meeting during the election cycle with a lawyer he believed was working with the Russian government, in the hopes of landing damaging information on Hillary Clinton. \"After this week\\'s Russia revelations, the mood in the West Wing is increasingly grim and paranoid,\" the website Axios wrote on Friday. \"But President [Donald] Trump seems to relish being embattled: One friend describes him as \\'acting like a cornerman in a boxing match.\\'\" (For the non-sports-lovers, a cornerman is like a coach and director of a bout, treating the fighter\\'s wounds, dishing out strategy and hyping him or her up.)   Related: Trump is still trolling the media   The Axios piece, written by Mike Allen and Jonathan Swan, also reveals how Trump watches CNN and other cable news like it\\'s football game tape, breaking down good plays and errors, dictating who didn\\'t do their job well and who made a nice recovery. Even in private, Trump reportedly calls CNN \"fraud news\" but talks about it all the time. During \"Trump\\'s constant patter about TV,\" Axios wrote, \"he praises aides for their combative appearances. He periodically asks about surrogates who have scored points on cable: \\'Why isn\\'t she my press secretary?\\'\" Trump is especially pleased with controversial aide Seb Gorka\\'s recent appearances on TV, reportedly loving \"when Gorka told CNN morning host Alisyn Camerota that more people are interested in cartoons than CNN, and that the network\\'s ratings are lower than Nick at Nite\\'s.\" Trump doesn\\'t limit his TV intake to just what he can outside normal workday hours. Reports have long suggested that Trump records cable news and watches it throughout the day to see how things are going and to critique his aides. \"It\\'s kind of remarkable, really, that someone would actually want to watch cable news on recording,\" New York Magazine\\'s Gabriel Sherman said on a Slate podcast in March. \"Donald Trump apparently does, and when he goes back up to the residence at the end of the day, I\\'ve been told he spends a lot of time flipping through the cable networks, including CNN, and catching up on the way he\\'s been covered. This is a man whose validation is cemented by the way the media covers him, so he obsessively monitors his media coverage.\" A  Time magazine profile of Trump \"after hours\" featured an anecdote that sounds almost exactly like a coach going back to find a specific moment from a game. It showed him going through \"old recordings of cable news shows, until he comes to what he is after,\" which proved to be a Fox News clip of a Senate hearing. More recently, a   New York Times Magazine  profile this week showed Trump \"watching a recording of \\'Fox and Friends\\' from about four hours earlier on a large TV mounted on the wall.\" This anecdote might have irked the president. \"The W.H. is functioning perfectly, focused on HealthCare, Tax Cuts/Reform & many other things,\" he tweeted this week. \"I have very little time for watching T.V.\"  \\n   \\n \\n\\t \\t\\n \\n This is an archived article that was published on sltrib.com in 2017, and information in the article may be outdated.

In the interview–only one of such interviews he had with the shock jock that have made headlines in recent days–Trump describes a lavish event he was hosting at the resort where rich people were mingling with Marines.\\xa0 Soon, Trump said an apparently unpopular “man, about 80 years old–very wealthy man” fell off the stage and began bleeding on the marble floor of Mar-a-Lago’s ballroom.  “So what happens is, this guy falls off right on his face, hits his head, and I thought he died. And you know what I did? I said, ‘Oh my god, that’s disgusting,’ and I turned away,” Trump told Stern. “I couldn’t, you know, he was right in front of me and I turned away. I didn’t want to touch him… he’s bleeding all over the place, I felt terribly, you know, beautiful marble floor, didn’t look so good. It changed color. Became very red.”  As Trump continues to recount the story, he told Stern that the Marines in attendance–who were seated in the “worst table in the whole place”–rushed to help him as his wife was “screaming” and rich people were “turning away.”   “The next day, I forgot to call… to say is he’s ok,” Trump said. “It’s just not my thing… I just don’t like looking at blood.” Trump is known to be a germaphobe, but this isn’t the first time he’s spoken about people bleeding at Mar-a-Lago.  Earlier this year Trump began a heated war of words with Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, the hosts of MSNBC’s  Morning Joe . At one point, Trump said Brzezinski was “bleeding badly from a face lift” during a visit to the Floridia resort, a claim that was later debunked.

Alec Baldwin, in yet another lip-pouting cold open appearance as Donald Trump on Saturday, was asked by an adviser how the military should respond to aliens from \"Zorblat-9\" invading the planet — and quickly taking control of the U.S. \"We don\\'t know that they\\'re from Zorblat-9; I\\'ve heard it\\'s a fantastic place,\" Trump, decked out in an Air Force jacket, told the military adviser. \"Oh my god, does he have business ties on Zorblat-9?\" a shocked soldier present in the room reacted. Before questioning whether the apocalyptic invaders really were from Zorblat-9, Trump charged that the aliens are \"laughing at us.\"    SNL\\'s President Trump wants to bring back coal rather than fighting aliens. (NBC)    \"We have got the best military, but we don\\'t win anymore,\" Trump said. \"They\\'re killing us and laughing at us.\" Then the orange-tinted mock commander came up with a novel solution to the impending alien takeover. \"We\\'re going to bring coal back,\" he exclaimed. \"We\\'re going to have so much coal you\\'re going to say \\'where did all this coal come from?\\' \" \"But what about the aliens?\" the confused military adviser screamed. \"They just vaporized the entire state of California.\"    Shwing!

Ten Years After His Casino Business Failed, He Was Still Writing Off Losses \\n Trump posing with what he said was a recent tax return (Feb. 25, 2016) \\nIn 2005, Donald J. Trump married model Melanija Knavs, his third wife. That year, the real-estate mogul and newly minted TV star earned $153 million dollars, about $3 million a week. That’s far more than all but a tiny sliver of the U.S. population.\\nThe newlyweds paid $36.6 million of that year’s take in federal income taxes, a rate of 24%, putting the Trumps in much the same tax league as any other two-earner professional couple making about $400,000 a year.\\nOr to put it another way, Donald Trump was paid that year like a member of the 0.001%, but he paid taxes like the 99%. And by at least one measure, he paid like the bottom 50%.\\n   Click to view Donald Trump’s 2005 Form 1040 \\nDCReport has obtained Donald Trump’s Form 1040 federal tax return for 2005.\\xa0There’s no smoking gun there, no obvious evasion, but clearly some bending of the tax laws almost to the breaking point. The document offers a rare glimpse at how a super wealthy couple can manipulate and manage our complex tax laws to reduce their obligations far below rates paid by typical salaried professionals or even blue-collar wage earners.\\nThe White House confirmed the authenticity of the tax returns. “Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid,” the White House said in a statement, “the dishonest media can continue to make this part of their agenda, while the President will focus on his, which includes tax reform that will benefit all Americans.”\\nTrump’s lawyers have said that any audit of the 2005 tax return is now closed. However, the president has made it clear, since he took office, that he has no intention of making public his tax returns.\\n What’s Not There\\xa0  \\nThe 1040 shows how Trump obtained money—salary, business profits, dividends and the like. But there is still far more that it doesn’t say. It does not name the sources of his vast income, whether rich golfers playing on his various courses or Russian oligarchs visiting his various hotels. The identities of companies and individuals who paid Trump would be disclosed in the hundreds of pages of schedules, statements and other attachments which a 1040 only summarizes.\\nNor does the 1040 distinguish between Trump’s business and personal expenses—money spent traveling in his personal jet between homes and offices in New York and Florida or between hotels and golf courses around the world. There are no specifics on how much he wrote off for business dinners or gifts or even the vast sums he depreciates each year from his buildings.\\n If you would like to see more journalism like this, please help. DCReport.org is a nonprofit organization. Like you, we want a government that is moral, ethical and answerable to the citizens.[wpedon id=”26″]\\nThere is one clear expense, however, that can be discerned because portions of Trump’s 1995 state tax returns became public last fall. Trump got out of repaying nearly $1 billion he borrowed for his failed casino business. When you don’t repay a loan Congress says that money is income and you owe taxes on it immediately.\\nInstead, Trump made use of an abusive tax shelter that Congress soon closed to newcomers. Like magic, the tax shelter converted what should have been a tax bill of about $360 million into future tax breaks. Ten years later, on his 2005 return, Trump was still saving tax dollars thanks to that tax shelter.\\xa0Trump has refused to release his tax returns.\\n A Dual-Tax System \\nTo understand the Trump tax returns it’s important to realize that America has two income tax systems. The regular income tax was supplemented by a parallel tax system, signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1986, called the Alternative Minimum Tax or AMT.\\nHow these two systems interact is central to understanding the Trumps’ taxes.\\nViewed in terms of the regular federal income tax system, here is what Trump did:\\nTrump reported $152.7 million of income. He also reported $103.2 million of negative income, the remainder of the roughly $918 million tax shelter he bought in 1995. That deal was disclosed earlier in three summary pages of his 1995 Connecticut, New York and New Jersey state income-tax returns.\\n  HOW WE GOT THE STORY  \\nThat Trump had only $103 million of his $918 million tax shelter left in 2005 also tells us something about his past income. Using up the other $815 million of negative income in the tax shelter indicates that he earned an average of $81.5 million annually during the 10 years from 1995 through 2004.\\nDeducting the negative income lowered Trump’s adjusted gross income or AGI to $48.6 million. AGI is the last figure on the bottom of the front page of a federal tax return.\\nFrom that, the Trumps took $17 million in itemized deductions, which are not specified. That left\\xa0 $31.6 million of taxable income.\\nThe Trumps paid just $5.3 million of regular federal income tax. Measured against their cash income of almost $153 million their federal income tax rate was 3.48%.\\nThat figure is slightly lower than the tax rate paid by the poorest half of Americans. The half of taxpayers whose income was less than $33,485 that year\\xa0paid 3.51%\\xa0of their money in federal income taxes.\\n Caught by the AMT \\nTrump’s total federal tax bill was larger, though, because of the Alternative Minimum Tax or AMT.\\nThe President, in writing, has called for eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax . Now we know one reason why—he lives like a king, but wants to pay taxes like a Walmart cashier.\\nAll high-income Americans must calculate both their regular income tax and their AMT income tax and pay whichever is larger.\\nMost of that $103 million of negative income was ignored under the AMT, which meant that for tax purposes Trump’s income was larger than under the regular system.\\nThe Trump income subject to AMT was $111.7 million, according to Daniel Shaviro, a New York University law professor who as a Congressional staffer helped draft the AMT three decades ago.\\nThe Trumps paid $31.3 million in AMT which, together with the regular tax, made their total federal income tax $36.6 million.\\nViewed in terms of their positive income of almost $153 million the total Trump tax bill came to 24%. That’s in the range paid by two-income career couples who both work all year to earn about $400,000. The Trumps income was $418,460 per day.\\n   A two-page document detailing Donald Trump’s victorious battle to save Earth from Kryptonian warlord General Zod has been revealed by US TV network MSNBC.  The document, which was sent in the post by an ‘anonymous source’, outlines Trump’s epic battle between General Zod and his allies in Metropolis and the Fortress of Solitude. The White House said that releasing details of President Trump’s “heroic battles to save the Earth from very bad dudes” was against the law. Journalist Simon Williams, interviewed on MSNBC, said he had received the documents in the post along with a note. “There is no signature or name on the note but it reads, ‘Very smart move by President Trump to use Lex Luther to trick Zod and his allies. GREAT JOB!\\'” He revealed. Suggestions that President Trump leaked the document himself have been strongly denied by the White House.\\n“The president is far too busy battling the deadite hordes that were unleashed when CNN recited passages from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis,” said a spokesperson.  \\n \\n \\n \\n   In a speech in Tennessee, US President Donald Trump said he sees himself in predecessor Andrew Jackson, who orchestrated the forced removal of thousands of Native Americans on the deadly trek west that survivors called the \"Trail of Tears.\"   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Donald Trump speaks in the White House near a portrait of Andrew Jackson, a president considered to be the first American populist and also the architect of the forced removal of Native Americans. \\n (TRT World and Agencies)\\n \\n \\n \\n The day before a federal judge in Hawaii shut down the second White House attempt at banning travel from several Muslim countries, US President Donald Trump on Wednesday visited the home and grave of another chief executive, Andrew Jackson, responsible for the forced removal of thousands of native Americans. \"Inspirational visit, I have to tell you. I\\'m a fan,\" Trump reportedly said after laying a wreath at the Hermitage, the plantation where Jackson lived and died in Tennessee.\\n   Trump salutes, lays a wreath at the tomb of Andrew Jackson pic.twitter.com/YqO5Pq3D6C — Abby D. Phillip (@abbydphillip) March 15, 2017 \\n\\n During a rally in Nashville, Tennessee, Trump appeared to compare himself to Jackson, who had served as a messenger in the American Revolution, appealing to the seventh president in the first person. \"It was during the revolution that Jackson first confronted and defied an arrogant elite,\" Trump told the crowd, according to the Associated Press.  \"Does that sound familiar to you?\" he said. \"Oh, I know the feeling, Andrew.\" Widely considered to be the first American populist president, Jackson, a wealthy former general, slave-holding plantation owner and jurist, touted his own connection to average Americans in defiance of the political establishment at the time. But for Native Americans, Jackson\\'s legacy remains the illegal and inhumane treatment in the name of taking native land. The territories, in modern Georgia, Alabama, Florida and Mississippi, then went to white Americans. Much of the land was used for growing cotton and other cash crops, harvested by enslaved African Americans. Slavery in the United States was often a system of legalised rape and murder of millions of people over the course of hundreds of years; captivity solely based on the colour of their skin. Their children were born and died as the property of wealthy white landowners.  To many, Jackson represents some of the most brutal and unforgivably unjust aspects of American history, the consequences of which the country still struggles to understand and cope with. Put succinctly, Jackson represents genocide, slavery and the tyranny of white supremacy.\\n   As Trump salutes a man who massacred indigenous people and bought, sold, and tortured enslaved Africans, the courts rule against him. https://t.co/Dv5op4BHNl — Shaun King (@ShaunKing) March 15, 2017 \\n\\n \\n    My Latest.

None.https://t.co/N43D7ufsoo  — Shaun King (@ShaunKing) March 15, 2017 \\n\\n Trump going out of his way to honour Jackson comes as another provocative act in an already provocative presidency. But Trump in his speech notably did not mention slavery or the expulsion of native people. He simply stated that both he and Jackson went against the establishment at the time. To many ears, this is code for federal government attempts to enforce the constitution and bill of rights on behalf of people of colour.  The expulsions of Native Americans in the southern states that Jackson spearheaded extended over the course of his presidency, between 1829 and 1837, and concluded during the term of his lesser-known successor, Martin Van Buren.\\n   Andrew Jackson, role model to @realDonaldTrump, offering $10 per 100 lashes given to an escaped slave (ht @ShaunKing) pic.twitter.com/9Y6tjy5fTU — Philip N Cohen (@familyunequal) March 16, 2017 \\n\\n Over the objections of the Supreme Court at the time, Jackson pushed for the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which allowed state militias in Georgia and other southern states to march tens of thousands of Native Americans hundreds of miles west to Oklahoma. Thousands died of disease and exposure to the elements. It was one of the first forced removals of indigenous people in the history of the United States, and saw men, women and children penned into concentration camps. The march of the Cherokee out of north Georgia was one of the deadliest, an ordeal the tribe would call the \"Trail of Tears.\" Members of the tribe attempted to contest Jackson\\'s effort in the Supreme Court, where they won their case. Chief Justice John Marshall agreed that the Cherokee nation\\'s right to the land predated and superseded the laws of the state of Georgia. But Jackson proceeded with his decision to see the tribe forced out, and declared the ruling of the court powerless to stop the Removal Act, passed by Congress. \"John Marshall has issued his decision. Let him enforce it,\" Jackson told Cherokee leaders, who would later reluctantly sign over their rights to their land in the the face of deadly force. The dynamic bears stark parallels to Trump\\'s recent Muslim ban. Namely that federal judges are able to issue declarations against the prohibition, but they cannot get into the heads of officials at the US border. A recent NBC report found a massive surge in the number of people who have had their mobile phones searched when coming into the country. Many officials applied this scrutiny to American citizens who are more often Muslim than non-Muslim.\\n   Thank you Andrew Jackson! #POTUS7 #USA pic.twitter.com/GToWsWXiNv — Donald J.

Mike Huckabee, a big star in the panoply of evangelical politics, echoed Jackson\\'s sentiment that judges themselves are powerless to enforce laws.

In theory, if the executive directs them to ignore the orders of the courts, there\\'s not much those who go to work wearing robes and suits can do to change the minds of folks who don badges. For the last two years, Trump has made a point of expressing his loyalty to police officers. Just as the local militias did in Georgia in 1830, if they feel more loyalty to the president than the courts, there\\'s not much the courts can do. In February, Trump tweeted that a \"so-called judge\" was responsible for blocking his original travel ban, prompting condemnation from his own nominee for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch. The executive branch turning against the judicial has worried observers and legal scholars, and has few precedents in American history, except for Jackson\\'s presidency.\\n   The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 \\n\\n There\\'s a deep irony to Trump choosing Jackson as a reflection of his own presidency. Trump during his campaign promised to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington, removing influence peddling and favoritism from the federal government. Jackson made his mark on history by creating the \"spoils system,\" in which a president could award jobs in government to allies and friends who had supported them in a campaign. Despite attempts at regulation to create a meritocracy in civil service, the favors-for-favors system Jackson put in place remains. Today, Trump\\'s team, composed of people who \"have made a fortune,\" continues Jackson\\'s legacy of the spoils system. Border and customs officials, meanwhile, may be trying to re-enact the work of local state militias, the precursors of modern police departments, from the same tearful time.\\n  Source: TRT World\\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov (left) and Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak met with President Trump last week in the Oval Office.\\n \\n \\n Alexander Shcherbak/TASS/Getty Images\\n \\n \\n  hide caption \\n \\n   toggle caption \\n  \\n \\n \\n Alexander Shcherbak/TASS/Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov (left) and Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak met with President Trump last week in the Oval Office.\\n \\n \\n Alexander Shcherbak/TASS/Getty Images\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  Updated at 9:45 p.m. ET  President Trump revealed \"highly classified information\" to two top Russian officials during a controversial Oval Office meeting last week, according to a report from The Washington Post.  The Post, citing current and former U.S. officials, reported Monday evening that the information relayed by the president to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak \"jeopardized a critical source of intelligence\" on ISIS:   \"The partner had not given the United States permission to share the material with Russia, and officials said Trump\\'s decision to do so endangers cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the Islamic State. After Trump\\'s meeting, senior White House officials took steps to contain the damage, placing calls to the CIA and the National Security Agency. \" \\'This is code-word information,\\' said a U.S. official familiar with the matter, using terminology that refers to one of the highest classification levels used by American spy agencies. Trump \\'revealed more information to the Russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies.\\' \"   \\n Trump also reportedly boasted to the Russians about the intelligence he was receiving, telling the two men, \"I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day\":   \"Trump went on to discuss aspects of the threat that the United States learned only through the espionage capabilities of a key partner. He did not reveal the specific intelligence-gathering method, but he described how the Islamic State was pursuing elements of a specific plot and how much harm such an attack could cause under varying circumstances. Most alarmingly, officials said, Trump revealed the city in the Islamic State\\'s territory where the U.S. intelligence partner detected the threat. \"The Washington Post is withholding most plot details, including the name of the city, at the urging of officials who warned that revealing them would jeopardize important intelligence capabilities.\"   Greg Miller, one of The Post reporters who broke the story, told NPR\\'s Ari Shapiro on All Things Considered that by sharing the information from another country, it could damage future intelligence gathering and U.S. relations with other partners. \"This is not intelligence that the United States gathered or owned. It wasn\\'t up to the United States to share, and so doing so really jeopardizes that relationship. It potentially damages trust that\\'s critical in these kinds of arrangements. And I think that\\'s one of the really big worries here,\" Miller told NPR. \"And in this case it\\'s important, because this is apparently an ongoing stream of intelligence into Islamic State plotting. I mean, what could be more important?\" \\n  BuzzFeed also confirmed The Post\\'s report, with one U.S. official saying that the disclosures from the president to the Russians were \"far worse than what has already been reported.\" The New York Times also noted that \"Trump\\'s disclosure does not appear to have been illegal — the president has the power to declassify almost anything. But sharing the information without the express permission of the ally who provided it represented a major breach of espionage etiquette and could jeopardize a crucial intelligence-sharing relationship.\" Trump\\'s meeting with the Russians came last Wednesday, the day after he fired FBI Director James Comey, who was overseeing an investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. elections and possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. The visit was fraught with bad optics, and Kislyak\\'s attendance — only confirmed by photos from Russian state media — was especially notable because he has been at the center of many of the Trump administration\\'s controversies involving Russia. Only a Russian Foreign Ministry photographer was allowed in to document the meeting; no U.S. media were allowed. Trump\\'s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign after just over three weeks on the job after it was revealed he had discussed Russian sanctions with Kislyak and then subsequently misled Vice President Pence about those conversations. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced to recuse himself from any involvement in the FBI\\'s investigations into Russia after it was revealed that he twice met with Kislyak, despite testifying during his confirmation hearing that he had had no contact with Russian officials. Monday\\'s reports of Trump revealing classified information to the Russians come just ahead of his first foreign trip as president. He\\'s set to depart on Friday, traveling to Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Vatican, then attending a NATO meeting in Brussels, Belgium, and a G7 meeting in Italy. \\n National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters outside the White House that the \"story that came out tonight, as reported, is false.\" \"At no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed, and the president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known,\" McMaster said. However, The Post story and other subsequent reports didn\\'t say that it was sources, methods or military operations discussed, but simply classified information. \"I was in the room, and it didn\\'t happen,\" McMaster said at the end of his abrupt statement. He departed without taking questions. \"During President Trump\\'s meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov, a broad range of subjects were discussed among which were common efforts and threats regarding counter-terrorism,\" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement. \"During that exchange the nature of specific threats were discussed, but they did not discuss sources, methods or military operations.\" Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said in a statement that, \"I want to learn more about what occurred and what was shared, but if true, this report is troubling.\" Corker told Bloomberg News that the White House was \"in a downward spiral right now and they\\'ve got to figure out a way to come to grips with all that\\'s happening.\" Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., said that if The Washington Post\\'s report was true, it was \"inexcusable.\" \\n  If true, this is a slap in the face to the intel community.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 6, 2016 \\n \\n \\n House Speaker Paul Ryan said back in July, with regard to Clinton\\'s emails, that people who are \"extremely careless\" with classified information no longer should have access to it. \\n \\n On Monday, Ryan spokesman Doug Andres said that, \"We have no way to know what was said, but protecting our nation\\'s secrets is paramount. The speaker hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration.\"\\n \\n\\tDonald Trump might be the first pet-less president in 150 years, \\xadafter a plan to have him adopt a goldendoodle dog fell through.\\nLois Pope, a Palm Beach, Fla., philanthropist and a longtime friend of the president-elect, believes a pooch belongs in the White House and began searching for a hypoallergenic breed for Trump once he won the election.\\n“Every president has had a first dog, and he did not have a dog,” said Pope, 83, whose husband, Generoso Jr., founded The National Enquirer and left her $200 million after his death in 1988. “I wanted to find a dog with a great disposition, and I didn’t want a small dog. He’s a guy who is 6-foot-2. He doesn’t want a small dog.”\\nPope chose one with a burnt-orange coat — similar in color to Trump’s mane — that is part golden retriever and part poodle.\\nShe named the 8-week-old pup Patton — after Trump’s favorite military hero — and sent him an ownership certificate.\\n“He’s a great dog. He’s intelligent. He doesn’t forget things. You tell him ‘no’ once, and he stays put,” Pope said of the now-30-pound canine. “Even ladies like him because he doesn’t jump all over them.”\\nWhen Pope joined the future first family for Thanksgiving dinner at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, she brought pictures of Patton.\\n“Show it to Barron. He’s going to fall in love with him,” Trump said, according to Pope, referring to the president-elect’s 10-year-old son with wife Melania Trump\\nBut Pope began to fret.\\n“I couldn’t sleep, and the reason I couldn’t sleep was because I fell in love with the dog,” she told The Post. “I thought, what am I going to do? I’m going to have to get him another dog.”\\nWhen the Trumps arrived in Palm Beach for Christmas, Pope steeled herself and went to Mar-a-Lago.\\n“I walked over to him, through the Secret Service, and I told him, ‘Donald, I’m sorry. You can’t have Patton,’\\u2009” she said.\\n   PattonLarry Marano \\nTurns out the future president was also having second thoughts.\\n“Donald said, ‘But, Lois, I can’t take the dog,’\\u2009” Pope recalled. “He said, ‘Look at what I do. I’m here, I’m in New York, I’m in Washington. What am I going to do with the dog?’ And I said, ‘Well, you can’t have him!’\\n“We went back and forth between ‘You can’t have him’ and ‘I don’t want him’ for a little while,” she added.\\n“What a relief! Introducing a dog into a family is not an easy thing to do. When I was potty-training him, he made a few mistakes. I’m sure they wouldn’t like that at Trump Tower.”\\nBarring any plans to adopt a goldfish, Trump would be the first president since Reconstruction without a pet in the White House and the first since 1901 without a dog. Trump transition officials did not return messages for comment.\\nPresident Andrew Johnson had no furry companions in the West Wing other than a nest of white mice he found in his bedroom. Johnson was impeached in 1868.\\nPresident William McKinley had two kittens, roosters and a yellow-headed Mexican parrot, but no pooch. He was assassinated in 1901.\\nMost modern presidents kept animals on the White House grounds, many as gifts from world leaders.\\nSoviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev gave a white puppy named Pushinka to President Kennedy. And Sen. Ted Kennedy gave Bo, a Portuguese water dog, to President Obama in 2009.\\nPope offered to find another pooch for the next first family.\\n“I said, ‘When you’re ready for a first dog, I would scour the nation for the perfect dog,’” she recalled.\\n\\t  Book a wedding at a Trump property, and you might get\\xa0President Trump himself as a guest.  That\\'s what happened this past weekend at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., as well as at another wedding at Mar-a-Lago in February. The brides for both weddings talked about the president\\'s wedding visits in interviews with\\xa0Town &\\xa0Country . Trump swung by Kristen and\\xa0Tucker Gladhill’\\'s wedding last Saturday as the reception was winding down, after he\\'d had dinner. Kristen Gladhill said,\\xa0\"It felt like time stood still.\" There were chants of \"USA!\" and compliments to the president (\"Looking good, Donald!\"), but Gladhill insisted that this wasn\\'t meant to make the wedding political. \"Regardless of my feelings personally or how we voted,\" it’s an honor to have the person who’s running the free world come show up at our wedding,\" she said. Vanessa Falk Lindner, the bride in the wedding Trump stopped by in February, told Town & Country that her parents have been members of Mar-a-Lago, Trump\\'s property in Palm Beach, for years. That time, Trump was invited to the wedding. \"We got his reply card and he wrote, \\'Will try to stop by if in town—Best Wishes,\" Falk Lindner said. Though reports at the time made it sound like the visit to the wedding — which happened while Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe was in town — the bride said his attendance was confirmed a week before the wedding. The president even made a speech at the wedding, noting that he knew the families. \"They\\'re going to have many, many years of love and success and everything that goes with it,\" he said of the Falk Lindner and her husband, Carl Lindner.\\xa0\"I saw them out on the lawn today and I said to the prime minister of Japan, I said, \\'Shinzo, let\\'s go over and say hello. Look how beautiful they are.\\' So they have pictures, which are pretty good pictures, with the prime minister of Japan and the president.\"   This Cookie Notice (“Notice”) explains how NBCUniversal and  its affiliates  (“NBCUniversal” or “we”), along with our partners, including advertisers and vendors, use cookies and similar tracking technologies when you use our websites, applications, such as games, interactive TV, voice-activated assistants, and other services that link to this policy, as well as connected devices, including those used in our theme parks (“Services”).

He’s soured on the President because of the newly proposed Republican health care bill. \\n \\n \\n That legislation, which the president supports, could result in dramatic cuts in addiction treatment services. \\n \\n \\n Three years ago, Moss found his son, Rob, dead in his bed from a heroin overdose. He was 24. \\n \\n \\n “The bill is an absolute betrayal of what Trump represented on the campaign trail,” he said. “I feel betrayed.” \\n \\n \\n \\n Moss feels it personally. \\n \\n \\n Last year, at a campaign rally in Iowa, Trump reached out and spoke directly to Moss about Rob’s death. \\n \\n \\n “In all fairness to your son, it’s a tough thing. Some very, very strong people have not been able to get off (heroin),” Trump called out to Moss in the crowd. “The biggest thing we can do in honor of your son … we have to be able to stop it.” \\n \\n \\n When Moss became emotional, Trump comforted him. \\n \\n \\n “I know what you went through. And he’s a great father. I can see it. And your son is proud of you. Your son is proud of you,” Trump said. “I’ll bet he was a great boy.” \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Several times on the campaign trail, Trump vowed to increase services for people facing addiction. \\n \\n \\n “We will help all of those people so seriously addicted. We’ll get them assistance,” he told the crowd at a campaign event in New Hampshire in October. \\n \\n \\n Moss trusted Trump. \\n \\n \\n “I truly believe from the heart that (Trump) is going to do everything he can. He’s going to create treatment centers for the kids,” he said last year. \\n \\n \\n \\n But last week, Moss read about the proposed American Health Care Act. The Republican bill would end the Obamacare requirement that addiction services and mental health treatment be covered under Medicaid in the 31 states that expanded the health care program – which include Moss’ home state of New York.\\n \\n \\n “This bill would devastate efforts to address the opioid crisis,” said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, director of the Bloomberg American Health Initiative at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “There’s no question this legislation in the House of Representatives would cost American lives.”\\n \\n \\n At a CNN town hall event last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was asked about the bill’s provisions for opioid treatment. \\n \\n \\n \\n He responded that state governors had “wonderful ideas about how to address it” but that they felt “hamstrung by the federal government.”\\n \\n \\n “There are wonderful ways if we keep the focus on the patient – not the government, but on the patient,” he said. \\n \\n \\n Moss looks back on his days on the campaign trail, on how he sold his trucks to finance the trip, how he sang his heart out and went from restaurant to restaurant to hand out “Donald Trump for President” CDs. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n “I did a lot to promote his candidacy,” he said. “Now, I wish I had never sold my equipment.” \\n \\n \\n But he doesn’t like to think about regrets. He’s looking to the future. \\n \\n \\n Earlier this month, more than 300 people showed up in 6-degree weather for a fundraiser Moss organized in his son’s memory. \\n \\n \\n \\n Join the conversation\\n \\n See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n He raised $3,000 for a local drug treatment center, but he said the greatest gift of the evening was that people who’d lost loved ones to drug addiction came together and comforted one another. \\n \\n \\n “We all felt less alone,” he said.\\n \\n \\n CNN’s John Bonifield and Michael Nedelman contributed to this report.\\n\\n     Actress and ultra-feminist Emma Thompson shocked the host of a Scandinavian talk show Thursday when she said President Trump propositioned her — sort of. “He asked me out once,” Thompson told host Fredrik Skavlan.\\xa0“I’ll tell you the story, it’s very funny.” Thompson said she was in Los Angeles to film “Primary Colors,” the 1998 political movie\\xa0starring John Travolta that was loosely based on Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign.  She recounts: “I was in my trailer and it was on the Universal lot. … So the phone rings in my trailer, which it’s never done before. … I lift up the phone: ‘Hi. It’s Donald Trump here.’ I said, ‘Really? What? Can I help you?’ ” (The gifted actress has not mastered her Trump impression. In her telling, he sounds more Texan than New Yorker.) Trump offered her “accommodation” in one of his properties, she recounted, bragging that they were “really comfortable.” Thompson, perhaps not understanding the offer of a hotel room to be a romantic gesture, said she asked him, “Why are you offering me somewhere to stay in my trailer?” “Well, you know, I think we would get on very well, maybe we could have dinner some time,” she said Trump responded. Turning to the host,\\xa0she said: “I didn’t know what to do with myself!” According to IMDb, “Primary Colors” filmed from May 5 to Aug. 4, 1997. Trump announced his separation from second wife Marla Maples in May of the same year. Their divorce was finalized in 1999. Thompson said she quickly ended the call, blowing off Trump with an “I’ll get back to you.” Skavlan, the host of the show, sat agog during Thompson’s storytelling, eyes wide and mouth open. “Just to be clear, you never met him before?” he asked. “No, I’d never met him,” she said. “You’ve never met him since?” he asked. “I’ve never met him since.” It’s hard to believe the model-loving Republican president once held a candle for a woman Meryl Streep has described as a “rabid man-eating feminist like me.” But in the 1990s, Thompson was still establishing her career in the American market, so her political leanings may not have been as well-known. And at the time, Trump was still wavering between the Democrats and the GOP. Thompson was also just coming off the film “Sense and Sensibility,” arguably one of her most traditionally romantic roles. Still, Thompson said she regrets not taking Trump up on his offer. “Think of the stories!” she said. “You could be the first lady,” Skavlan joked. In a bizarre simulacrum, Thompson’s “Primary Colors” character was based on former first lady Hillary Clinton — Trump’s eventual presidential opponent, whom he has described as “the devil.”  More from Morning Mix:        President Donald Trump speaks with CBN Founder Pat Robertson at the White House on Wednesday, July 12, 2017. (Screen grab from CBN)  (CNSNews.com) – President Donald Trump says he got along “very well” with Russian President Vladimir Putin when the met at the G20 in Hamburg last week. “He wants what’s good for Russia, and I want what’s good for the United States,” Trump said in an interview with CBN, the Christian Broadcasting Network, on Wednesday. Trump said it would have been better for Russia if Hillary Clinton were president because she would have “decimated” the U.S. military and raised U.S. energy prices by building windmills. “Yeah, I think we got along very well,” Trump said of his meeting with Putin. “And I think that’s a good thing. That’s not a bad thing. \"You know, people said oh they shouldn’t get along. Well, who are the people that are saying that?\\xa0 I think we got along very, very well. We’re a tremendously powerful nuclear power. And so are they. It doesn’t make sense not to have some kind of relationship.” Trump said the U.S. is getting more and more powerful, “because I’m a big military person.”  If Hillary had won, our military would be decimated. Our energy would be much more expensive. That’s what Putin doesn’t like about me. And that’s why I say, why would he want me? Because from day one, I wanted a strong military. He doesn’t want to see that. And from day one, I want fracking and everything else to get energy prices low and to create tremendous energy. We’re going to be self-supporting – we just about are now. We’re going to be exporting energy. He doesn’t want that. He would like Hillary, where she wants to have windmills. He would much rather have that because energy prices would go up, and Russia, as you know, relies very much on energy. So there are many things that I do that are the exact opposite of what he would want. So when I keep hearing about that he would have rather had Trump, I think probably not.        President-elect Donald Trump poses for a portrait at Trump Tower on Jan. 17. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)  “Make America Great Again.” The four words that would help propel Donald Trump to the White House were an inspiration born years before, when hardly anyone but Trump himself could imagine him taking the oath of office as the 45th president of the United States. It happened on Nov. 7, 2012, the day after Mitt Romney lost what had been presumed to be a winnable race against President Obama. Republicans were spiraling into an identity crisis, one that had some wondering whether a GOP president would ever sit in the Oval Office again. But on the 26th floor of a golden Manhattan tower that bears his name, Trump was coming to the conclusion that his own moment was at hand. And in typical fashion, the first thing he thought about was how to brand it. One after another, phrases popped into his head. “We Will Make America Great.” That one did not have the right ring. Then, “Make America Great.” But that sounded like a slight to the country. And then, it hit him: “Make America Great Again.” “I said, ‘That is so good.’ I wrote it down,” Trump recalled in an interview. “I went to my lawyers. I have a lot of lawyers in-house. We have many lawyers. I have got guys that handle this stuff. I said, ‘See if you can have this registered and trademarked.’\\xa0”  (Alice Li/The Washington Post)   Five days later, Trump signed an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in which he asked for exclusive rights to use “Make America Great Again” for “political action committee services, namely, promoting public awareness of political issues and fundraising in the field of politics.” He enclosed a $325 registration fee. His was a vision that ran against the conventional wisdom of the time — in fact, it was “much the opposite,” Trump said. To save itself, the Republican establishment was convinced, the GOP would have to sand off its edges, become kinder and more inclusive. “Make America Great Again” was divisive and backward-looking. It made no nod to diversity or civility or progress. It sounded like a death wish. But Trump had seen something different in the country, and in the daily lives of its struggling citizens. “I felt that jobs were hurting,” he said. “I looked at the many types of illness our country had, and whether it’s at the border, whether it’s security, whether it’s law and order or lack of law and order. Then, of course, you get to trade, and I said to myself, ‘What would be good?’ I was sitting at my desk, where I am right now, and I said, ‘Make America Great Again.’\\xa0” Democrats slammed it. “If you’re looking for someone to say what is wrong with America, I’m not your candidate. I think there is more right than wrong,” Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton said. “I don’t think we have to make America great. I think we have to make America greater.” Her husband, former president Bill Clinton, went so far as to declare it a racist dog whistle. “I’m actually old enough to remember the good old days, and they weren’t all that good in many ways,” he said at a rally in Orlando. “That message where ‘I’ll give you America great again’ is if you’re a white Southerner, you know exactly what it means, don’t you?” The slogan itself was not entirely original. Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush had used “Let’s Make America Great Again” in their 1980 campaign — a fact that Trump maintained he did not know until about a year ago. “But he didn’t trademark it,” Trump said of Reagan. His decision to claim legal ownership reflected a businessman’s mind-set. “I think I’m somebody that understands marketing,” Trump said. Trump Organization lawyer Alan Garten said Trump holds upward of 800 trademarks in more than 80 countries. The trademark became effective on July 14, 2015, a month after Trump formally announced his campaign and met the legal requirement that he was actually using it for the purposes spelled out in his application. Having won the trademark, Trump was aggressive in protecting his idea. When his GOP primary rivals Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker began tucking “make America great again” into their own speeches, Trump’s lawyers fired off cease-and-desist letters.     Trump’s red trucker cap featuring the Make America Great Again slogan was ubiquitious during the campaign. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  More than just a hat Trump was an impulsive and erratic candidate who ran a chaotic campaign. The one constant, it often seemed, was “Make America Great Again.” “I didn’t know it was going to catch on like it did. It’s been amazing,” Trump said. “The hat, I guess, is the biggest symbol, wouldn’t you say?” There were plenty of snickers when his Federal Election Commission filings showed that his campaign was spending more on “Make America Great Again” trucker caps than on polling, political consultants, staff or television ads. “An appropriate icon for his failing campaign,” the Washington Examiner’s Philip Wegmann wrote in late October. “The millions of hats will make excellent keepsakes for those who thought his populist bravado could overcome Clinton’s unimaginative and conventional but well-oiled political machine.” Trump saw the hats as a fundraising and advertising vehicle. He was thrilled when his campaign headgear landed in the New York Times Style section — during Fashion Week, no less. “In the Style section, it was the ornament — what do you call that? — an accessory. They said the accessory of the year. You know the hat. You’d see people going to the fanciest balls at the Waldorf Astoria wearing red hats,” he exulted. As is often the case, Trump’s description is more than a little hyperbolic. What the newspaper actually wrote was that the “old-school” caps had become “the ironic must-have fashion accessory of the summer,” favored by hipsters for their “uncanny ability to capture the current absurdist political moment.” None of which fazed the celebrity billionaire who had debuted the hats by wearing one during a July 2015 trip to the Mexican border — or the legions of supporters who raced to snap them up. Trump had designed them himself, he said. The basic models sold through his campaign website were priced at $25. “How many did we sell? Does anyone know? Millions!” Trump said in the interview. “It was copied, unfortunately. It was knocked off by 10 to one. It was knocked off by others. But it was a slogan, and every time somebody buys one, that’s an advertisement.” However many hats he sold, what cannot be disputed is that “Make America Great Again” caught on. It was the most effective kind of political message, bite-sized and visceral. “It actually inspired me,” Trump said, “because to me, it meant jobs. It meant industry, and meant military strength. It meant taking care of our veterans. It meant so much.”  [When was America great? It depends on who you are.]  That kind of mission statement was something that Clinton’s campaign — for all its poll testing and high-priced advice from Madison Avenue — struggled to articulate. Her strategists considered 85 possibilities for a general-election campaign slogan before settling on “Stronger Together,” according to an email from the account of campaign chairman John Podesta that was published by WikiLeaks. What they were up against was nothing short of “a marketing genius,” said David Axelrod, who had been Obama’s chief political strategist. Trump “understood the market that he was trying to reach. You can’t deny him that. He was very focused from the start on who he was talking to.” While Clinton carried the popular vote, Trump lined up the states he needed to win what mattered: the electoral college. “In terms of galvanizing the market that he was talking to,” Axelrod said, “he did it single-mindedly and ingeniously.” Thinking reelection Halfway through his interview with The Washington Post, Trump shared a bit of news: He already has decided on his slogan for a reelection bid in 2020. “Are you ready?” he said. “\\xa0‘Keep America Great,’ exclamation point.” “Get me my lawyer!” the president-elect shouted. Two minutes later, one arrived. “Will you trademark and register, if you would, if you like it — I think I like it, right? Do this: ‘Keep America Great,’ with an exclamation point. With and without an exclamation. ‘Keep America Great,’\\xa0” Trump said. “Got it,” the lawyer replied. That bit of business out of the way, Trump returned to the interview. “I never thought I’d be giving [you] my expression for four years [from now],” he said. “But I am so confident that we are going to be, it is going to be so amazing. It’s the only reason I give it to you. If I was, like, ambiguous about it, if I wasn’t sure about what is going to happen — the country is going to be great.” All of which raises the questions: How can greatness be measured and sensed? What does it even mean? “Being a great president has to do with a lot of things, but one of them is being a great cheerleader for the country,” Trump said. “And we’re going to show the people as we build up our military, we’re going to display our military. “That military may come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. That military may be flying over New York City and Washington, D.C., for parades. I mean, we’re going to be showing our military,” he added. But Trump acknowledged that slogans and showmanship will not be the ultimate tests of whether the country is “great again.” The president-elect has an ambitious to-do list for the next four years: building stronger borders, keeping the country safe against terrorism, producing more jobs, repealing the Affordable Care Act, replacing it with something better, promoting excellence in engineering and science, investing in modern infrastructure. Ultimately, it will be up to the people for whom “Make America Great Again” was a covenant, not a slogan, to decide whether the 45th president has lived up to his promise. “I think they have to feel it,” Trump acknowledged. “Being a cheerleader or a salesman for the country is very important, but you still have to produce the results.” “Honestly, you haven’t seen anything yet. Wait till you see what happens, starting next Monday,” he said. “A lot of things are going to happen. Great things.”  Read more:   Trump’s Cabinet nominees keep contradicting him   Surprisingly, Trump inauguration shapes up to be a relatively low-key affair   ‘Finally.

Scarola is representing attorney Bradley Edwards, a party\\xa0in the case.\\nScarola told\\xa0LawNewz.com\\xa0that they have evidence that at least one of the now (former) employees at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club were\\xa0recruited by Epstein’s agent to become involved in a pattern of alleged molestations.\\nThe civil trial,\\xa0which\\xa0is expected to begin soon, is a complicated one and dates back to 2009. \\xa0It involves allegations of malicious prosecution,\\xa0and defamation filed by Florida\\xa0attorney Bradley Edwards. Edwards also represents several of Epstein’s alleged\\xa0victims who brought separate civil cases against Epstein. \\xa0But, what is particularly interesting about this latest case\\xa0is that\\xa0it now appears to involve President Donald Trump himself.\\nIn 2007, federal prosecutors, ironically under the leadership of Trump’s current Secretary of Labor Alexander\\xa0Acosta (who was a U.S. Attorney at the time), quietly entered into a secret non-prosecution agreement with the billionaire which ensured that Epstein and his ‘co-conspirators’\\xa0would not\\xa0be prosecuted\\xa0federally in exchange for Epstein’s guilty plea to state charges. Basically,\\xa0Epstein got a slap on the wrist and served\\xa013 months in a Florida prison\\xa0and home detention for solicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution .\\n Court records in the civil case claim that Epstein repeatedly sexually assaulted more than 40 young girls on numerous occasions between 2002 and 2005 at\\xa0his mansion in West Palm Beach, Florida.\\nWhile there is no evidence that Trump was involved in Epstein’s scheme, Bradley’s attorneys claim that “Trump\\xa0and Epstein\\xa0have\\xa0acknowledged that they were friends, that they have socialized together. We have reason to believe that Trump was a guest in Epstein’s home during the period of time that Epstein was engaged in molestation.”\\nTrump is included\\xa0on a witness list filed on August 31, 2016 along with Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico.\\nIn Bradley Edwards’ affidavit filed in support of the civil case, he claims that Mark Epstein (Jeffrey Epstein’s brother) testified that Trump flew\\xa0on Jeffrey Epstein’s plane with him (the same plane where multiple young girls\\xa0say they used to have sex.) \\xa0Former President Bill Clinton is also said to have flown on that same plane.\\n“Epstein’s phone directory from his computer contains 14 phone numbers for Donald Trump, including emergency numbers, car numbers, and numbers to Trump’s security guard and houseman,” the affidavit claims.\\n“The likelihood is very low that he is\\xa0deposed or called as a witness at trial,” Scarola explained in a story first reported by The Florida Bulldog, an investigative nonprofit. “There are, as you might imagine, substantial hurdles in calling a sitting U.S president and we don’t want\\xa0any further delays on this case.”\\nThe civil trial has been delayed several times, and a judge is expected to set a trial date shortly.

Here was a man fixated on his personal brand and look like nobody they\\'d ever seen. His biggest insecurity, his friends say, was his paunch. And yet he ate and worked out (or, rather, didn\\'t) like a man who\\'s slept through the last 50 years of public-health warnings. Sure, Trump doesn\\'t drink or smoke. But those were about the only health vices he avoided on the trail. He guzzled Diet Coke all day long. Fast food was a constant. The \"three staples,\" in the words of one aide: Domino\\'s, KFC, and McDonald\\'s. Big Macs were served on silver trays in his private jet.     Trump\\'s culinary habits have changed since he\\'s entered the White House, an aide insists. He still drinks Diet Coke. But he\\'s ditched the fast food in recent weeks. \"The steak-and-potatoes narrative is true,\" says a source familiar with Trump\\'s routine. \"But he also really likes fish and seafood — so, like crab and shrimp. Things like that. He does eat salad. He\\'ll eat like Cobb salad … He eats vegetables.\" But usually as a side to a slab of steak, according to dining companions.  The lowdown on Trump\\'s habits:   A red-meat guy: Trump loves big steaks, preferably the ones served at his clubs. (His butler told the NYT the steaks would be so well done they would \"rock on the plate.\") Trump also brags about the bacon he served as appetizers to guests at his Doral golf resort in Miami. His affection for Big Macs was not a real-American campaign ploy. Snacks: We asked a former aide who spent a lot of time with Trump whether he ever ate fruit or nuts. \"Never seen it,\" the aide replied. Instead, Trump snacks on original-flavored Lay\\'s potato chips and vanilla-flavored Keebler Vienna Fingers. Those two are constants on his plane. Drinks: It\\'s well-documented that Trump doesn\\'t touch alcohol. But he loves a virgin Bloody Mary — tomato juice on ice. \"It\\'s like his version of a cocktail,\" says an aide. Trump blends food with politics. Says a former aide: \"He used to love Oreos but he really did stop eating them once they moved [their plants] to Mexico.\" Caffeine: He doesn\\'t drink coffee. Only Diet Coke or the occasional full-sugared version when it\\'s a particularly trying day at the office. Sleep: Very little — maybe four hours. \"I\\'ve gotten calls from him as late as 1:30 [a.m.] and as early as 4:30,\" a former aide said. Exercise: The only workout Trump gets is an occasional round of golf. Even then, he mostly travels by cart. On the campaign trail he viewed his rallies as his form of exercise. Workaholic: Aides say he has no hobbies besides golf. He doesn\\'t hike or hunt, as his sons do. Trump\\'s pleasures revolve around work. He basks in media coverage of himself and in the vast crowds that now attend his every public appearance.   Why Trump thinks this doesn\\'t matter : \"He really believes in genetic gifts,\" says Trump biographer Michael D\\'Antonio. \"He wants to assume that he can do something that others can\\'t do simply because of who he is.\" D\\'Antonio points out that Trump is tall and until his mid-40s \"he was probably a little bit blessed with getting away without paying much attention to his diet and exercise.\" A source who\\'s spent a significant amount of time with Trump thinks that in Trump\\'s own head, the billionaire hasn\\'t physically changed since the 1980s — still a strapping specimen.  Why this does matter: At 70, Trump is the oldest president to enter office. He\\'s subsisted most of his life on very little sleep, coupled with little exercise and a high-fat diet. It\\'s possible that Trump\\'s self-conception is correct — that genetics will triumph over habits. Maybe his perpetual motion and unceasing work ethic really does provide all the exercise he needs. But after two health obsessed, workout warriors as presidents, Trump marks a return to a 90s-era, Middle America Bill Clinton diet.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was on hand, and after the president left the room, the nation\\'s chief diplomat reportedly called Trump a \"moron\" -- or more specifically, a \"f***ing moron.\" It\\'s been unclear, though, exactly what transpired during that meeting. NBC News, which broke the \"moron\" story last week, moved the ball forward today.   President Donald Trump said he wanted what amounted to a nearly tenfold increase in the U.S. nuclear arsenal during a gathering this past summer of the nation\\'s highest ranking national security leaders, according to three officials who were in the room.Trump\\'s comments, the officials said, came in response to a briefing slide he was shown that charted the steady reduction of U.S. nuclear weapons since the late 1960s. Trump indicated he wanted a bigger stockpile, not the bottom position on that downward-sloping curve.     There were reportedly several \"tense exchanges\" at the July 20 meeting, and it\\'s not clear if the comments on nuclear weapons directly led to TIllerson\\'s Trump criticisms. Nevertheless, according to the account, the president saw a slide that showed the size of the U.S. nuclear stockpile over the past seven decades. Trump saw the highest point on the chart -- a half-century ago, the American stockpile was at 32,000 -- and \"told his team he wanted the U.S. to have that many now.\" Officials in the room then had to explain there are \"legal and practical impediments\" to such a move, which isn\\'t at all necessary anyway. The NBC report added, \"Any increase in America\\'s nuclear arsenal would not only break with decades of U.S. nuclear doctrine but also violate international disarmament treaties signed by every president since Ronald Reagan.\" It\\'s tempting to explore what the point of such a build-up would be -- it would serve no substantive purpose -- but I think we can safely guess that the president wasn\\'t thinking along these lines. Rather, Trump saw a higher number, and probably assumed that more is better and fewer is worse. Other presidents had more, so he should have more. Making matters even worse is Trump\\'s record of confusion on the subject itself. Around Christmas last year, for example, the Republican declared, apropos of nothing, that United States \"must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.” It\\'s never been clear exactly what that meant, though NBC News\\' report on the July 20 meeting casts the quote in a new light. What\\'s more, as we discussed at the time, his pattern of reckless incompetence on this issue is unnervingly long. In one of the GOP primary debates, for example, Trump seemed baffled by a simple question about the nuclear triad. In one of the general election debates, Trump was asked about nuclear first-use policy, and delivered two completely contradictory answers over the course of a few seconds. This is the same Republican who, over the course of his campaign, suggested more countries – specifically South Korea, Japan, and Saudi Arabia – should develop nuclear-weapons programs for their own national security interests. Around the same time, Trump seemed genuinely confused by the meaning of the word “proliferation.” If we weren\\'t talking about the world\\'s most powerful office and the world\\'s most dangerous weapon, Trump\\'s ridiculousness on the issue wouldn\\'t be quite so scary.  \\n Intelligence officials have admitted to editing certain things out of Donald Trump’s daily intelligence briefings because they do not want to include any information that would upset him. They specifically mentioned that they like to remove things about Russian election meddling and the special prosecutor investigation taking place. This latest bit of info proves once again that Donald Trump does not have the mental stability to be the President of the United States, as Ring of Fire’s Farron Cousins explains.\\n \\nTranscript:\\nDonald Trump is still having his daily intelligence briefings edited so that there’s no information in there that could possibly upset him and cause him to go off into some kind of man child temper tantrum.\\nAccording to senior intelligence officials who have worked in the White House, they said that intelligence briefings every single day are being edited or rewritten in a certain way to prevent Donald Trump from ever coming across any information that is going to upset him, specifically all of the information coming from intelligence agencies that show that yes, Russia did interfere with the 2016 election.\\nThey’ve said that when Trump gets that kind of information, he gets absolutely apoplectic. He can’t handle it. He lashes out at staff. He lashes out at intelligence officials, so they decided the best way to handle this situation is not show it to him. They did admit that sometimes they will hand write it in there towards the end because they know he won’t ever read that far so that they can still claim, “Yes, we did show you this.”\\nLet me explain this in a way that I think everybody can understand. I have a very young son, and he hates the Grinch. Recently, we were watching it with the rest of the kids, and he started crying and ran out of the room upset when the Grinch came on TV. It scared him. We decided to turn it off and we let him come back in the room, because we didn’t want to upset him by letting him see this scary Grinch on TV. He’s three, by the way, just turned three on September 11th of this year.\\nDonald Trump is a man in his 70s. He’s not a three year old child afraid of a cartoon that’s going to give him bad dreams. He’s the president of the United States. We can’t dumb him down to the level and handle him with the same kind of kid gloves that we do a toddler, especially on something as important as intelligence matters. Of all the people in this country, I think Donald Trump could benefit from a little bit more intelligence, even in the form of a briefing, but this is the way the country runs today.\\nDonald Trump doesn’t want to know what’s happening in the rest of the world. He doesn’t want to know what’s happening in the United States. He just wants to know when he’s got a chance to go get another Big Mac and then go play a round of golf. He is not fit to be the president of the United States, and if our intelligence officials are having to leave out vital national security information from his briefings to avoid him running out of the room crying, then that proves this man is not mentally stable enough to be the president of the United States.\\n     President Donald Trump paid $38 million in taxes on more than $150 million in income in 2005, the White House said on Tuesday, responding to an MSNBC report that the network had obtained two pages of the returns. MSNBC host Rachel Maddow said she received the documents from journalist David Cay Johnston, who said on her show that he received them in the mail. The returns, which MSNBC posted on its website, showed Trump paid an effective federal tax rate of 25 percent in 2005 after writing off $100 million in losses. The White House said in a statement that Trump took into account \"large scale depreciation for construction.\" Trump has repeatedly refused to release his tax returns, drawing criticism throughout his campaign last year and speculation from his political rivals he was hiding something. A New York Times report in October said Trump, a New York real estate developer, declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns. The newspaper said the large tax deduction could have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years. But the returns posted by MSNBC on Tuesday showed that he did pay taxes in 2005. The returns do not indicate whether he paid taxes in other years or how much he might have paid. The Washington Post reported last year that Trump paid no federal income taxes for at least two years in the late 1970s. The White House said in a statement on Tuesday that Trump, as head of the Trump Organization, had a responsibility \"to pay no more tax than legally required.\" Presidents and major candidates for the White House have routinely released their income tax returns. Trump says he has not released his tax returns because they are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. Experts say an IRS audit does not bar someone from releasing the documents. During a September presidential debate, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton criticized Trump, a Republican, for paying no federal income taxes. \"That makes me smart,\" he responded. Trump has feuded with the media since his inauguration, often accusing it of promoting \"fake news\" intended to undermine his presidency. \"The dishonest media can continue to make this part of their agenda, while the President will focus on his, which includes tax reform that will benefit all Americans,\" the White House said on Tuesday.

Just how much diet soda the president consumes, though, was revealed Saturday by the New York Times, which reported that Trump has a button to summon household staff for one of the 12 Diet Cokes he drinks each day.

Please try again     It’s a lot of soda to consume in one day, and — were it regular soda — most research suggests the potential consequences would be alarming. A 12-ounce can of regular Coke has 140 calories and 39 grams of sugar. By drinking Diet Coke instead, which has no calories or sugar, Trump has avoided consuming 1,680 calories and 468 grams of sugar daily. But the effects of drinking diet soda have been long debated by experts, with some studies raising concerns about long-term health consequences. Experimental research on artificial sweeteners, like the ones found in diet soda, is inconclusive. The Canadian Medical Association Journal found in July that there are very few randomly controlled studies on artificial sweeteners — just seven trials involving only about 1,000 people — that looked at what happened when people consumed artificial sweeteners for more than six months.

Nearly half of adults and a quarter of children consume artificial sweeteners each day, according to the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Diet soda might be a good short-term substitute for people trying to stay away from the high-sugar content of regular soda, when consumed in small amounts. Some dieticians and nutrition scientists believe sucralose and stevia, which can both be found in diet sodas, are a healthier alternative for people to enjoy sweet drinks without the calories. But others say artificial sweeteners can confuse the brain and the body, desensitizing consumers to sugar and leading them to consume more sweets without being aware of their calorie intake. There is one thing, however, most studies agree on: Even if diet soda is healthier, you probably shouldn’t be drinking 12 cans a day.   This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.   Here’s what the risks might be if — like Trump — you do.  Stroke or dementia  People who drank diet soda daily were three times more likely to develop stroke and dementia than those who consumed it weekly or less, according to a study published in April in the journal Stroke. The study followed 2,888 people aged 45 and over for risk of stroke and 1,484 people 60 and over for dementia over 10 years. They were participants of the Framingham Heart Study, in which several thousand men and women have taken regular health tests since the 1970s. The study found those who consumed at least one artificially sweetened drink a day, compared to less than one a week, were three times as likely to have an ischemic stroke from blood vessel blockage. They were also three times as likely to be diagnosed with dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease. The effect of diet sodas persisted even if the researchers controlled for factors such as diabetes or high blood pressure.   This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.   But Matthew Pace, a Boston University School of Medicine neurologist and the study’s lead author, emphasized that the research showed only a correlation — and not causation. While the risk of stroke and dementia was greater, the numbers were low. “Three percent of the people had a new stroke and five percent developed dementia, so we’re still talking about a small number of people developing either stroke or dementia,” he said in a video explaining the study. In responding to the study, the American Beverage Association said in a statement that low-calorie sweeteners have been proven safe by worldwide government safety authorities as well as “hundreds of scientific studies.” “There is nothing in this research that counters this well-established fact,” officials said.

An unsafe amount of caffeine consumption  About 400 milligrams of caffeine a day is what’s considered safe for most healthy adults, according to the Mayo Clinic. That amount is equal to four cups of brewed coffee and 10 cans of soda — two cans less than the amount Trump drinks. That much caffeine can lead to migraines, insomnia, restlessness and muscle tremors.  Weight gain  Obesity rates have leveled off in the last decade in terms of BMI, while the consumption of noncaloric sweeteners increased. Those patterns could mean that artificial sweeteners have helped curb obesity, but studies in recent years suggest those sweeteners are causing the exact thing the people consuming them are hoping to avoid: weight gain.   This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.   The Canadian Medical Association Journal study in July found there wasn’t much evidence proving sweeteners prevented weight loss. Researchers looked at 30 studies tracking people’s diets over time and found that those who consumed sweeteners were more likely to have increases in their waist and waistlines — and had a higher risk of obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes and strokes.   Obesity and diabetes may be risks for teens drinking soda, but for younger children, sugary drinks can lead to aggressive behaviour and mental problems, a study suggests.   “I think originally it was calories were the problem, and we’ve made something that was zero calories, so we’re good,” Meghan Azad, a researcher at the University of Manitoba, told The Washington Post in July. “But we’re learning that it’s not just about the calories.” In 2015, researchers at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio examined data for nearly 10 years from 749 Mexican Americans and European Americans ages 65 and older and found that daily and occasional diet soda drinkers gained almost three times as much belly fat as non-drinkers.   This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.   Occasional diet soda drinkers added an average of 1.83 inches to their waist circumferences, while the non-drinkers added .8 inches over the nearly 10-year period. Those who consumed diet soda daily gained 3.16 inches. But some reports show that the benefits or harm of artificial sweeteners depend on what they’re paired with. For example, a 2012 study by The New England Journal of Medicine found that Dutch children who consumed one artificially sweetened beverage each day for 18 months gained less weight than those who drank one sugary beverage a day.      Let Trump Be Trump: New book has Trump campaign inside look — screaming fits, rivalries and Big Macs       Quarter Pounder in chief? While previous presidents preferred healthier fare, Trump feasts on fast food        This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.   Then, in August, Dana Small, a neuroscientist at Yale University, told Vox that her research suggests artificial sweeteners could cause weight gain if consumed with carbohydrates, because the blend of foods disrupts the body’s metabolic response. A diet drink consumed on an empty stomach could be less harmful than one consumed with, say, a Big Mac. It’s a concerning discovery, she said, because food companies are designing “healthier” products that contain blends of sweeteners and carbohydrates. For example, Chobani’s Simply 100 yogurt contains 14 grams of carbohydrate (six of them from sugar) and stevia leaf extract, Vox reported.  I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke  People who drink three or more artificially sweetened beverages a day, Small told Vox, could be more likely to drink them during meals with carbs that disrupt the body’s metabolic response. In various Q&As during his campaign, Trump expressed his love for pasta, second helpings of potatoes au gratin and steak. If he’s drinking 12 cans of Diet Coke a day, it’s likely he’s drinking some of them with carbs. Trump tweeted “I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke.” Trump also tweeted “People are going crazy with my comments on Diet Coke (soda). Let’s face it–this stuff just doesn’t work. It makes you hungry.”     Notice for the Postmedia Network  This website uses cookies to personalize your content (including ads), and allows us to analyze our traffic. Read more about cookies here.

This claim came out about a year ago during the the election season, and so I dropped in to see what the scoop was now that Donald J. Trump was hired. “Yes, he’s the healthiest president-elect. I can say that unequivocally. He’s the best. Just the best all around,” says his doctor, Twitter mentor, personal trainer, and coke-addled binge buddy Harold Bornstein. As I got into the limo that was to take Bornstein and Donald Trump to lunch, I was met with Bornstein, who sat alone in a ruffled suitcoat, stained pants, and held a beautifully polished mirror off of which he was snorting premo-grade Colombian cocaine. “I try to get four or five lines down as fast as possible,” Bornstein says, “before Donny can get into the stash. You know, it’s kinda like a race with Donny. Everything’s a race. Skyscrapers. Women. The presidential office. People. It’s all just some race or another to the guy, so I gotta get mine in while I can.” Not even a minute into the ride Bornstein tensed up and lashed out at me as I watched, listened, and recorded our conversation. “Hey, don’t be shedding any bad vibes, Jeff. Nobody invited you anyway. You can fuck off for all I care.” And then, like the sun reappearing from behind the clouds, he shifted moods again. “And, you know, to be honest, I kinda just want to impress Donny. He blows through this shit like it’s nothing — like he’s drinking water or something, through his nose. I just can’t keep up, man.” He sniffled, looked into the mirror, and adjusted his long, graying hair. Harold Bornstein, also known as Count Harold, writes epic tantric love poetry when he’s not performing colonoscopies. For Trump, he says he’s performed both. Bornstein has treated Donald Trump for over 35 years, and before that, his father treated the Trumps. The two have grown close over the years, and from the way that Bornstein spoke about Trump I could tell there was a special connection between the washed out colonoscopist and president-elect. While our driver took us to pick up Trump, Bornstein regaled me in his medical practice. “We also do endoscopies. I used to have this pretty funny comic on my website of a man lying in a cot that said ‘Please inform all of your visitors that a video tape of your endoscopy is available in the gift shop.’ I wanted it to say ‘colonoscopy,’ but my nurse said that was too crude. What the fuck does she know of humor anyway?” When we picked up Trump he was waiting on the sidewalk outside of the Kasowitz law firm mumbling to himself and tapping his toes on the crumbling concrete. He entered the limo a bit glum and soon recounted a disagreement he had had with his lawyer about the difference between the words consent, consummate, consummate consent, and commiserate. “Commiserate,” Kasowitz reportedly said, “is what you pay me to do. Consummate consent is what you pay a prostitute for. And consent is the thing you didn’t get before you and Epstein consummated your love for that thirteen-year-old girl.” Trump then asked Bornstein to pass the mirror so he could get what he termed a “big league,” caterpillar-sized line of coke. This appeared to cheer him up. “But,” he continued, patting Bornstein affectionately on the back, “at least I have my doctor behind me. Get it? Get it? He’s my colonoscopist!” For a story about the man’s health, I must say I was somewhat skeptical, if not outright doubtful, given his high-stress lifestyle choices, but to be honest, once he entered the limo I realized that I had never seen such a healthy specimen in my life. His skin was so fine and translucent that the flesh beneath it almost shined like an incandescent bulb. His hair was so thin and soft it blew in the window’s breeze like that of a freshly shampooed puppy. His nose was… well, probably more powerful than a Dyson vacuum cleaner. The man had never had a drink of alcohol in his life. “Don’t like the taste of the stuff. It’s too bitter.” He’s never smoked cigarettes. “They’re for fags. That’s why they call ’em that.” What was abundantly clear, however, was that the man is addicted to cocaine. I asked him if he thought the cocaine would affect his health negatively.   Trump grew beet red and clutched his hands as though he were very, very constipated. “Wrong. Wrong. WRONG!” “Are you saying cocaine is wrong, or cocaine doesn’t negatively affect your health, Mr. Trump?” “My doctor — very good man, Harold — assures me this is the best of the Americas. You know, my only reservation is that we have to import it from some criminals in Colombia. You know how they import it? Harold knows. They put it up their butt. Believe me, I don’t want to be putting my nose on anything that has been in another man, woman, or child’s rectum. We should be growing this stuff ourselves. It think it would really give a bump to the economy, improve the bottom line!” He and Bornstein then erupted into another round of almost manic laughter. I should pause here and offer a statement of full disclosure: on the ride to Burger King I joined the two in a “bump,” as they call it. It wasn’t much, just enough to get a read on the quality of stuff they were snuffing. First I rubbed it on my gums, of course, as they had instructed, to a pleasurable tingling sensation. And then a little eensty beensty bump. But Trump wouldn’t let me stop there. “What are you, a girl?” I told him I wasn’t. “You some sort of pussy? Why don’t you take a whole line, like man? I don’t give interviews with women. I do other things with women. Am I right, Harold?” So then I took another bump, and a little line that Bornstein laid out for me. It was a kind line, thin as the hair on Trump’s head, and yet, the stuff blew me away. Before I knew it we were forty minutes outside of Newark and had a sixteen-year-old hooker in the limo named Monique. Trump pretended like he was answering questions about his personal health, which was indeed the original intent of the article I was tasked with writing, but the whole thing had shamefully spun out of control. “We’re gonna do great things,” Trump said. “My personal trainer has just told me about Pilates. It’s like yoga, but German. My dietitian recommended kale. Kale is OK — kinda bitter, but I’m told it’s gonna do bigly good things for my body. And then there’s kelp! Harold, have you heard about kelp? I’m told kelp is the new kale. We’re gonna get this stuff into the inner cities — it’s gonna blow their minds.” When I asked him about foreign policy he responded that there was none, but he was hopeful nonetheless. “What’s the name of that little country inside of another little country in the Middle East? Palestine? Yeah, we’re going to build a wall, it’s gonna knock their socks off — they have a wall? A lot of walls? Well what’s the problem?” Across the limousine Bornstein evidently sent Trump a Snapchat of something funny, to which both erupted into a cackling laughter. “Oh yeah, cous cous! We’re gonna win on some trade deals for cous cous, believe me. America never wins any more, and I think cous cous is really really great stuff — no, I really mean that — it’s like eating a million little Jewish pasta balls.” Let me remind the reader, I got into this limo for one purpose, and one purpose alone: to write an article about the healthiest presidential candidate — no president-elect — ever. I’m about sixteen “bumps” deep, Monique is so drunk she can’t respond intelligibly, and Harold is fondling Donny in what looks to be a impromptu colonoscopy. The rest simply isn’t fit to print. To make a long story short, Bornstein explained there’s an ongoing competition between the two as to who can use the most cocaine before they get to Burger King. “He’s always asking me to push my limits,” he says. “But, in the rush, I think some of my words… don’t come out exactly the way they were meant. I just don’t want him to think less of me, you know?” Bornstein, then very delirious, shifted moods once he realized that a stubby erection protruded from his underwear. “Hey, where’d my pants go? And who’s this dweeb with the voice recorder anyway? Donny, we gotta lose this fag!” The next thing I knew the limo came to a stop, Trump’s driver violently escorted me from the car, and Bornstein, Trump, and Monique sailed off into the New Jersey night on the long, hard road to Burger King.

But Rocky Suhayda thinks there is one political figure who presents a \"real opportunity\" to lessen the load. Who is it? Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president. \"Now, if Trump does win, OK, it\\'s going to be a real opportunity for people like white nationalists, acting intelligently to build upon that, and to go and start - you know how you have the black political caucus and what not in Congress and everything - to start building on something like that,\" Suhayda declared on his radio program last month. \"It doesn\\'t have to be anti-, like the movement\\'s been for decades, so much as it has to be pro-white,\" he added. \"You know what I\\'m saying? It\\'s kinda hard to go and call us bigots if we don\\'t go around and act like a bigot. That\\'s what the movement should contemplate. All right.\" Audio from the radio program was posted Saturday by BuzzFeed\\'s Andrew Kaczynski, who noted that Suhayda has in the past avoided making statements about Trump out of concern that he might harm the businessman\\'s candidacy. Yet, Kaczynski reported, in an American Nazi Party report from September, the chairman argued that Trump\\'s rhetoric revealed the secret popularity of the party\\'s messages. \"We have a wonderful OPPORTUNITY here folks, that may never come again, at the RIGHT time,\" Suhayda wrote, according to BuzzFeed. \"Donald Trump\\'s campaign statements, if nothing else, have SHOWN that \\'our views\\' are NOT so \\'unpopular\\' as the Political Correctness crowd have told everyone they are!\" Suhayda is far from the first avowed white supremacist to publicize his support and enthusiasm for Trump. Earlier this year, Rachel Pendergraft - the national organizer for the Knights Party, a standard-bearer for the Ku Klux Klan - told The Washington Post that the KKK had begun using Trump\\'s candidacy as a new conversation starter to recruit followers. She said this has been discussed on a private, members-only website and in \"e-news, stuff that goes out to members.\" In addition to opening \"a door to conversation,\" she said, Trump\\'s candidacy had electrified some members of the movement. \"They like the overall momentum of his rallies and his campaign,\" Pendergraft said. \"They like that he\\'s not willing to back down. He says what he believes, and he stands on that.\" On his radio show in February, David Duke - a former Ku Klux Klan leader and a current U.S. Senate candidate from Louisiana - encouraged listeners to cast their ballots for Trump, saying that \"voting against Donald Trump at this point is really treason to your heritage.\" Duke recently told NPR that he is \"100 percent behind\" Trump\\'s political agenda. \"As a United States senator, nobody will be more supportive of his legislative agenda, his Supreme Court agenda, than I will,\" Duke said. \"Donald Trump is not a racist,\" he added. \"And the truth is - in this country, if you simply defend the heritage of European American people, then you\\'re automatically a racist.\" Duke told NPR that polls among Trump supporters in Louisiana showed that \"75 to 80 percent\" would back his Senate run. \"You think Trump voters are your voters?\" asked Steve Inskeep, the host of NPR\\'s \"Morning Edition.\" \"Well, of course they are!\" Duke replied. \"Because I represent the ideas of preserving this country and the heritage of this country, and I think Trump represents that as well.\" Jared Taylor, editor of American Renaissance, a white-nationalist magazine and website based in Northern Virginia, told the New Yorker magazine that Trump may be in denial about the makeup of his base. \"I\\'m sure he would repudiate any association with people like me,\" Taylor told the magazine, \"but his support comes from people who are more like me than he might like to admit.\" In January, Taylor\\'s voice could be heard in a robo-call that encouraged Iowa voters to throw their support behind Trump. \"I urge you to vote for Donald Trump because he is the one candidate who points out that we should accept immigrants who are good for America,\" Taylor says on the recording, which was paid for by the American National super PAC. \"We don\\'t need Muslims. We need smart, well-educated white people who will assimilate to our culture. Vote Trump.\" Taylor told The Post in February that he finds Trump\\'s rhetoric on immigration appealing, even though he does not particularly care for the candidate\\'s brash style. \"I think what he\\'s done is a very important thing,\" Taylor told The Post. \"He\\'s the first candidate in decades to say almost explicitly that immigration should be in the interest of Americans and not just immigrants.\" He added, \"He\\'s attractive to many Americans who see their country slipping through their fingers. You don\\'t want to end your days living in an outpost of Haiti or Guatemala, do you?\" During his radio program last month, Suhayda said he was confident that Trump would emerge victorious in November\\'s election. Trump, he noted, has tapped into the frustrations among a large segment of white voters who have been forgotten. \"I think it\\'s gonna surprise the enemy, because I think that they feel that the white working class - especially the male portion of the working class and with him his female counterparts - have basically thrown in the towel,\" Suhayda said. \"Given up hope of any politician again standing up for their interests.\"  \\n\\t\\n \\t\\n\\t\\n\\t \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\t\\n\\tWASHINGTON D.C. – Authorities have issued an amber alert for the lost and presumed missing Donald Trump, last seen chasing a loose balloon through the streets of the U.S. capitol.\\n“We had just exited Krazy Kat’s Pizza and Arcade after Mr. Trump was ejected for throwing pizza at a nearby family,” said Vice-President Mike Pence, choking back tears, “I had tied the President’s balloon to his wrist so he wouldn’t let go of it but I guess the string was a little loose because next thing I know he and it were both gone!”\\nAt the time of the incident, Trump was wearing a Krazy Kat brand party hat and a black, ill-fitting, $12,000 suit. He can be identified by his unjustifiable confidence and tendency to misuse adverbs. Police have cautioned the public that the 70-year old President has been taught to be fearful of strangers and so, even if you spot him, he should not be approached if you are Black, Arab, Latino, Asian, or even the white kind of Spanish, as that would likely just make things worse.\\nWomen, the police added, should not approach him at any time for their own safety.\\n“If you see him, please just call the police so that we can return him to his loved ones,” said Officer Dale Barkley of DC Metro Police, “The President is easily distracted by trivial things so we are equipping all police with plates of cake and phones loaded with Twitter in the hopes that they can find him and convince him to come with them.”\\nMost will recall that this is not the first time the current leader of the free world has become lost. A noteworthy incident occurred during a campaign stop in Georgia in July 2016 when Mr. Trump followed a stray puppy into a construction site and accidentally rode a crane-mounted girder to the top of a skyscraper.\\n“Please help us bring our precious Donald home,” pleaded Pence to assembled cameras, “Much like millions of Americans for vastly different reasons, he’s probably very, very scared right now.”\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tWhat type of traveler are you?\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tLone Wanderer\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tMy Besties are Coming\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tBeach

from the fringes of the American right came quickly.\\n“Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists,” tweeted David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader and outspoken Trump supporter who attended the Charlottesville protest. \\nThe “Unite the Right” rally in the Virginia college town dissolved into chaos over the weekend as marchers — wielding Confederate and Nazi flags and bearing tiki torches and rifles as they denounced Charlottesville’s decision to remove a public statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee — clashed with counterprotesters, including some from Black Lives Matter and a group that goes by “antifa,” short for anti-fascist. \\nTrump issued a statement Saturday condemning the violence on “many sides” but did not specifically address the racist groups at the center of the events. (On Tuesday, he said he’d been waiting for more facts; he said he hadn’t known Duke was present, for example.)\\nOn Monday, Trump gave brief prepared remarks in which he called out the KKK and neo-Nazis by name and declared racism “evil,” though white nationalists said they didn’t take the condemnation seriously.\\nBut by Tuesday he was back to arguing that the white nationalists ought not bear all the blame.\\n“I think there is blame on both sides. You look at, you look at both sides. I think there’s blame on both sides,” Trump said.\\nHe assailed the counterprotesters for not having a permit.\\n“You had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit, and they were very, very violent,” he said.\\nAnd he said many of the people in Charlottesville weren’t hate-filled, just showing their opposition to the city council’s vote earlier this year to remove the statue. (The statue remains in place for now while the issue is tied up in court.)\\n“It looked like they had some rough, bad people, neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call ‘em,” Trump said. “But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest and very legally protest.”\\nIn fact, Trump argued, if statues of Confederate leaders like Lee — who led a rebellion against the United States — were removed, it might not be long before monuments to Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were also removed, since those men were slave-owners. That argument is a common talking point on the right, with Pat Buchanan recently making just that case on Newsmax, a right-wing website run by Trump’s friend Chris Ruddy.\\n“President Trump is right! One side had a permit to speak, one side charged with clubs & weapons! Look at the facts people,” tweeted Tim Gionet, a vocal alt-right activist who goes by “Baked Alaska” online.\\nOn Breitbart, the nationalist website once run by senior Trump aide Steve Bannon (who called it a “platform” for the alt-right), the headline blared: “POTUS comes roaring back with press smackdown at Trump Tower.”\\nRichard Spencer, another outspoken white supremacist who supports Trump, also cheered on the address, calling it “fair and down to earth.” \\n“We came in peace,” he wrote later.\\nMainstream Republicans, including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer, have defended Trump’s “both sides” argument.\\n“The president has good reason to also blame, or point the finger, at antifa and BLM. They are not innocent groups,” Fleischer said in an interview Tuesday. “I’m a purist on this. I’m all for counterprotest, but you cannot resort to violence. … If anyone engages in violence, they deserve condemnation.”\\n“Clearly all sides got at it in Charlottesville on Saturday,” he said.\\nBut he said he was troubled by Trump’s remark that there were “very fine people on both sides.”\\n“There are no very fine Nazis or Klan members, zero,” Fleischer said. \\n       World    This was published 5 years ago    By Greg Miller and Greg Jaffe Updated May 16, 2017 — 10.24am      Washington: US President Donald Trump revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in a White House meeting last week, according to current and former US officials, who said that Trump\\'s disclosures jeopardised a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State. The information Trump relayed had been provided by a US partner through an intelligence-sharing arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the US government, officials said. The partner had not given the United States permission to share the material with Russia, and officials said that Trump\\'s decision to do so risks cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of Islamic State (IS). After Trump\\'s meeting, senior White House officials took steps to contain the damage, placing calls to the CIA and National Security Agency. \"This is code-word information,\" said a US official familiar with the matter, using terminology that refers to one of the highest classification levels used by US spy agencies. Trump \"revealed more information to the Russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies\".       President Donald Trump meets with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, right, at the White House in Washington.Credit:AP    The revelation comes as Trump faces rising legal and political pressure on multiple Russia-related fronts. Last week, he fired FBI director James Comey in the midst of a bureau investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Trump\\'s subsequent admission that his decision was driven by \"this Russia thing\" was seen by critics as attempted obstruction of justice. One day after dismissing Comey, Trump welcomed Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak - a key figure in earlier Russia controversies - into the Oval Office. It was during that meeting, officials said, that Trump went off script and began describing details about an IS terrorist threat related to the use of laptop computers on aircraft. For anyone in government discussing such matters with an adversary would be illegal. As President, Trump has broad authority to declassify government secrets, making it unlikely that his disclosures broke the law. \"The President and the foreign minister reviewed common threats from terrorist organisations to include threats to aviation,\" said National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, who participated in the meeting. \"At no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly.\"          US President Donald Trump with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, left, and Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak in the White House in May.Credit:Russian Foreign Ministry    The CIA declined to comment and the National Security Agency did not respond to requests for comment. But other officials expressed concern with Trump\\'s handling of sensitive information as well as his grasp of the potential consequences. Exposure of an intelligence stream that has provided critical insight into IS, they said, could hinder the US\\' and its allies\\' ability to detect future threats.     US President Donald Trump shakes hands with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in the White House in Washington.Credit:Russian Foreign Ministry    \"It is all kind of shocking,\" said a former senior US official close to current administration officials. \"Trump seems to be very reckless, and doesn\\'t grasp the gravity of the things he\\'s dealing with, especially when it comes to intelligence and national security. And it\\'s all clouded because of this problem he has with Russia.\"   In his meeting with Lavrov, Trump seemed to be boasting about his inside knowledge of the looming threat. \"I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day,\" Trump said, according to an official with knowledge of the exchange. Trump went on to discuss aspects of the threat that the US only learned through the espionage capabilities of a key partner. He did not reveal the specific intelligence gathering method, but described how IS was pursuing elements of a specific plot and how much harm such an attack could cause under varying circumstances. Most alarmingly, officials said, Trump revealed the city in IS territory where the US intelligence partner detected the threat.  The Washington Post is withholding most plot details, including the name of the city, at the urging of officials who warned that revealing them would jeopardise important intelligence capabilities. \"Everyone knows this stream is very sensitive and the idea of sharing it at this level of granularity with the Russians is troubling,\" said a former senior US counter-terrorism official who also worked closely with members of the Trump national security team. He and others spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the subject. The identification of the location was seen as particularly problematic, officials said, because Russia could use that detail to help identify the US ally or intelligence capability involved. Officials said that the capability could be useful for other purposes, possibly providing intelligence on Russia\\'s presence in Syria. Moscow and would be keenly interested in identifying that source and possibly disrupting it.   Russia and the United States both regard IS as an enemy and share limited information about terrorist threats. But the two nations have competing agendas in Syria, where Moscow has deployed military assets and personnel to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. \"Russia could identify our sources or techniques,\" the senior US official said. A former intelligence official who handled high-level intelligence on Russia said that given the clues Trump provided, \"I don\\'t think that it would be that hard [for Russian spy services] to figure this out.\" At a more fundamental level, the information wasn\\'t the US\\' to provide to others. Under the rules of espionage, governments - and even individual agencies - are given significant control over whether and how the information they gather is disseminated even after it has been shared. Violating that practice undercuts trust considered essential to sharing secrets. The officials declined to identify the ally, but said it is one that has previously voiced frustration with Washington\\'s inability to safeguard sensitive information related to Iraq and Syria. \"If that partner learned we\\'d given this to Russia without their knowledge or asking first that is a blow to that relationship,\" the US official said.   Trump also described measures that the United States has taken or is contemplating to counter the threat, including military operations in Iraq and Syria as well as other steps to tighten security, officials said. The officials would not discuss details of those measures, but the Department of Homeland Security recently disclosed that it is considering banning laptops and other large electronic devices from carry-on bags on flights between Europe and the United States. The United States and Britain imposed a similar ban in March affecting travellers passing through airports in 10 Muslim-majority countries. Trump cast the countermeasures in wistful terms. \"Can you believe the world we live in today?\" he said, according to one official. \"Isn\\'t it crazy.\" A Russian photographer took photos of part of the session that were released by the Russian state-owned Tass news agency. No US news organisation was allowed to attend any part of the meeting. Senior White House officials appeared to recognise quickly that Trump had overstepped and moved to contain the potential fallout.   Thomas Bossert, assistant to the President for homeland security and counter-terrorism, placed calls to the directors of the CIA and the NSA, services most directly involved in the intelligence-sharing arrangement with the partner. One of Bossert\\'s subordinates also called for the problematic portion of Trump\\'s discussion to be stricken from internal memos and for the full transcript to be limited to a small circle of recipients, efforts to prevent sensitive details from being disseminated further or leaked. Trump has repeatedly gone off-script in his dealings with high-ranking foreign officials, most notably in his contentious introductory conversation with the Australian Prime Minister earlier this year. He has also faced criticism for lax attention to security at his Florida retreat Mar-a-Lago, where he appeared to field preliminary reports of a North Korea missile launch in full view of casual diners. US officials said that the National Security Council continues to prepare multi-page briefings for Trump to guide him through conversations with foreign leaders but that he has insisted that the guidance be distilled to a single page of bullet points, and often ignores those. \"He seems to get in the room or on the phone and just goes with it - and that has big downsides,\" the second former official said. \"Does he understand what\\'s classified and what\\'s not? That\\'s what worries me.\"   Lavrov\\'s reaction to the Trump disclosures was muted, officials said, calling for the United States to work more closely with Moscow on fighting terrorism. Kislyak has figured prominently in damaging stories about the Trump administration\\'s ties to Russia. Trump\\'s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign just 24 days into the job over his contacts with Kislyak and misleading statements about them. US Attorney-General Jeff Sessions was forced to recuse himself from matters related to the FBI\\'s Russia investigation after it was revealed that he had met and spoke with Kislyak despite denying any contact with Russian officials during his confirmation hearing. \"I\\'m sure Kislyak was able to fire off a good cable back to the Kremlin with all the details\" he gleaned from Trump, said the former US official who handled intelligence on Russia. The White House readout of the meeting with Lavrov and Kislyak made no mention of the discussion of a terrorist threat.   Loading \"Trump emphasised the need to work together to end the conflict in Syria,\" the summary said. Trump also \"raised Ukraine\" and \"emphasised his desire to build a better relationship between the United States and Russia\".  Washington Post       Most Viewed in World  Loading       ZEBULON, N.C. — A Gold Star family from Zebulon is speaking out about their interaction with President Donald Trump after their son\\'s death in Afghanistan and a monetary offer they said they never received. “We went to the State Fair, ate some deep fried Twinkies and had a good time,” Chris Baldridge recalled. “He’d just bring out the best in you.” Eight months later, Dillon Baldridge was killed in Afghanistan. Every day since, Chris Baldridge has worn a hat his son gave him. “It makes me proud,” he said. Chris Baldridge remembers the call he received from Trump after his son’s death, including an offer to give him a personal check for $25,000 after he expressed frustration with the military’s casualty benefits. Three months after that conversation, Chris Baldridge said he has still not received a check. “I mean, if you’re going to make a gesture like that, I just feel like you need to come through with it, you know,” Chris Baldridge said. White House officials told NBC News that the check was sent to the\\xa0Baldridge family, but it was delayed because of a problem in the approval process. Officials said Trump personally followed up to make sure the family got the check. Chris Baldridge said that, for him, it’s less about the money and more about feeling like his country let him down after his son was killed by the Afghan soldier he was training. “It’s hard to feel like something isn’t owed to you. I’d rather have him back than any dollar amount,” he said. Trump has faced criticism in recent days after he claimed to have called “every family of someone who’s died” and asserted that past presidents had not. The claims prompted several Gold Star families to come forward to say they never heard from the president after they lost a child in combat. Chris Baldridge said he is disheartened that his son never got to meet his little sister, Shelby. “He was our Captain America, something to look up to, for sure, something to brag about,” Chris Baldridge said of his son. WRAL reached out to the White House for comment, but did not receive a response. Trump spokeswoman Lindsay Walters told the Associated Press it was \"disgusting\" that the news media were casting his \"generous and sincere gesture\" in a negative light.   \\nThe New York Times: Digital and Home Delivery Subscriptions\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Offer for a New York Times News subscription; current subscribers not eligible.

Without the Alternative Minimum Tax, which Trump has said he’d like to eliminate, the real-estate developer would have paid just $5.3 million in taxes—an effective rate of less than 4 percent. While the White House said in a statement that it is “totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns,” Maddow noted that Johnston had not broken the law when he received the first two pages in the mail from an anonymous sender. She also noted, after an interminable, 20-minute lead-in, that MSNBC’s decision to report on the document is protected by the First Amendment. The details included in the 2005 return show that Trump earned the majority of his money from his then-hit reality show, The Apprentice, and from the sale of two properties—one in Manhattan, and one in San Francisco, which he sold to Hong Kong investors, according to the Daily Beast. He also wrote off more than $100 million in business losses—a fact that the White House confirmed but did not elaborate upon. “Before being elected President, Mr. Trump was one of the most successful businessmen in the world with a responsibility to his company, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,” the White House said in a statement shortly before Maddow read the details of the return live on air. “That being said, Mr. Trump paid $38 million dollars even after taking into account large scale depreciation for construction, on an income of more than $150 million dollars, as well as paying tens of millions of dollars in other taxes such as sales and excise taxes and employment taxes and this illegally published return proves just that.” The White House also pointed a finger at the media, condemning MSNBC as “desperate for ratings” and accusing the network of violating the law for ratings. “The dishonest media can continue to make this part of their agenda, while the president will focus on his, which includes tax reform that will benefit all Americans.” Trump’s tax returns have remained a mystery, and a fixation, since he first declared his candidacy for president in the summer of 2015. No major party presidential nominee has ever been so wealthy, nor has there been a candidate since the 1970s who flat-out refused to release their returns. At first, Trump said he could not release his returns because he was under audit—a contention that the Internal Revenue Service dismissed as untrue. Later, the Trump transition team acknowledged that he would not be releasing his returns regardless. At a press conference in January, weeks before he took office, he said that “the only ones who care about my tax returns are reporters” and that the public didn’t seem to mind. “I won. I became president. I don’t think they care at all.” Without information about his return, speculation has swirled as to the true nature of Trump’s finances, including the true extent of his wealth and the scope of his potential conflicts of interest. Ethics watchdogs have raised concerns that the president may be concealing financial entanglements or debts to foreign entities that could pose challenges to his ability to objectively carry out his duties, particularly with regard to international affairs. While the president has handed over day-to-day operations of his business empire to his two adult sons, he retains a financial stake in the Trump Organization that he has refused to divest. Though there has not been a full picture of Trump’s tax returns, this is not the first glimpse. In October,  The New York Times  published an analysis of three pages from what appeared to be Trump’s 1995 tax returns, which were anonymously mailed to the newspaper. The tax records showed that he declared a $916 million loss that year—a deduction so large that experts said it would have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for 18 years. At the time, a spokesperson for Trump said that he had paid property, state and local taxes, and that he was a “highly-skilled businessman” who has a responsibility to his business to not pay more than necessary. “Mr. Trump knows the tax code far better than anyone who has ever run for President and he is the only one that knows how to fix it.”        World    This was published 5 years ago    By David Fahrenthold Updated June 28, 2017 — 3.11pm      Washington: The framed copy of Time magazine was hung up in at least four of US President Trump\\'s golf clubs, from South Florida to Scotland. Filling the entire cover was a photo of Donald Trump. \"Donald Trump: The \\'Apprentice\\' is a television smash!\" the big headline says. Above the Time nameplate, there is another headline in all caps: \"Trump is hitting on all fronts ... even TV!\" This cover - dated March 1, 2009 - looks like an impressive memento from Trump\\'s pre-presidential career. To club members eating lunch, or golfers waiting for a pro-shop purchase, it seems to be a signal that Trump has always been a man who mattered. Even when he was just a reality-TV star, Trump was the kind of star who got a cover story in Time. But that isn\\'t true.       A fake edition of Time Magazine with Donald Trump on the cover hangs in a number of Trump properties.Credit:Screengrab/Washington Post    The Time cover is a fake. There was no March 1, 2009, issue of Time magazine. And there was no issue at all in 2009 that had Trump on the cover. In fact, the cover on display at Trump\\'s clubs,observed recently by a reporter visiting one of the properties, contains several small but telling mistakes. Its red border is skinnier than that of a genuine Time cover, and, unlike the real thing, there is no thin white border next to the red. The Trump cover\\'s secondary headlines are stacked on the right side - on a real Time cover, they would go across the top. And it has two exclamation points. Time headlines don\\'t yell.          Like many mock covers, the Time cover sporting Donald Trump has many clues that fail a reality check.Credit:Screengrab/Washington Post    \"I can confirm that this is not a real TIME cover,\" Kerri Chyka, a spokeswoman for Time, wrote in an email to The Washington Post. So how did Trump - who spent an entire campaign and much of his presidency accusing the mainstream media of producing \"fake news\" - wind up decorating his properties with a literal piece of phony journalism? The Trump Organisation did not respond to questions this week about who made the cover and why it was displayed at Trump clubs. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to say whether Trump had known the cover wasn\\'t real. \"We couldn\\'t comment on the decor at Trump Golf clubs one way or another,\" Sanders wrote in an email.   The cover seems to fit a broader pattern for Trump, who has often boasted of his appearances on Time\\'s cover and adorned his Trump Tower office with images of himself from magazines and newspapers. Trump has made claims about himself - about his charitable giving, his business success, even the size of the crowd at his inauguration - that are not supported by the facts. In this case, Trump\\'s golf clubs might seem like a place where he wouldn\\'t need to stretch the truth. Reality is flattering enough. The clubs are monuments to Trump\\'s success - they bear his name and are filled with his images.But, still, his staff added an extra trophy that was phony. It is not clear who created this fake cover - or why. Its date might be a clue: March 1, 2009, was the season debut of Trump\\'s show The Celebrity Apprentice. But a transcript of that show offers no answers. In that episode, various B-list celebrities competed to sell cupcakes, and Trump fired comedian Andrew Dice Clay for poor performance. Nobody mentioned Time magazine. While it\\'s not difficult to mock up a fake cover using graphic-design software - it\\'s a common souvenir from sports trips or school functions - whoever made this one actually sought out real Time headlines, to add to the fake.   There are secondary headlines on the Trump cover that tout stories on then President Barack Obama, climate change and the financial crisis. Two of those are taken from a real March 2, 2009, issue of Time, which featured actress Kate Winslet on the cover. But the issue makes no mention of Trump.  The Washington Post found that the fake cover had been hung in at least four of Trump\\'s 17 golf clubs. At Trump\\'s resort in Doral, Florida, outside Miami, the fake image hangs in two prominent spots. In the pro shop, it shares a wall with 11 other framed magazine pages - all of them highlighting Trump, another member of the Trump family or a Trump golf course. Among the covers with Trump\\'s face on them, the Time cover looks like one of the most impressive. The others are old - such as a 1984 cover of GQ - or from less prominent titles, such as Fairways + Greens magazine and TV Guide Canada. Those two publications are out of print.   A copy of the fake cover also hangs in Champions, the Doral resort\\'s sports bar. It faces a framed cover of Fortune magazine from 2004, showing Trump\\'s face with the headline \"Trumped\". That one is real. In Virginia, the phony Time cover hangs on the wall of the member\\'s dining room at the Trump golf course in suburban Loudoun County, near Washington. Trump has visited that club more frequently since moving into the White House. In early June, the President ate lunch in that dining room with football star Peyton Manning and Republican senator Bob Corker. A photo taken during their lunch shows that Trump\\'s chair faced the fake Time cover. At the same club, Trump\\'s staff put up a historical marker declaring that there had been a Civil War battle on the site - and that the adjacent Potomac River became a \"River of Blood\". Historians say this battle never happened. The marker was first reported by The New York Times. The Time cover also appears to have been hung up at Trump\\'s golf resort in Doonbeg, in western Ireland. Trump bought the club in 2014. Photos posted on TripAdvisor show it on the wall of a dining room. But when a reporter visited the club this past weekend, it was gone.   A bartender later found it in the manager\\'s office. Officials at the club could not explain why it had been moved. And at Trump\\'s Turnberry club in Scotland, employees said they recognised the cover. It had been added after Trump bought the course in 2014, said the employees, who spoke to the Post on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to comment to the media. One employee said the fake cover had previously hung in the resort\\'s pub, called \"The Duel in the Sun\" after the famous Open championship contest between golfers Tom Watson and Jack Nicklaus at Turnberry in 1977. But, she said, the cover was taken down a few weeks ago. \"We used to have a Time magazine cover up - aye, it was there for ages and ages, as long as I\\'ve been here. I know the one you\\'re on about,\" the employee said. \"But they came and took it down a while back.\" In its place, the club had hung up an old-timey photo of the course.   Club officials did not respond to queries about why it was taken down. The employee said it was part of a general reduction in photos of Trump. \"We certainly have been hearing more grumbling about all the stuff like that up on the walls since his election,\" the employee said. \"From Americans, mostly, funny enough. That\\'s why we all assumed they started taking some of his photos off the walls.\" \"But it was just a guess. I don\\'t actually have a Scooby [Doo],\" the employee added, rhyming slang for \"I don\\'t have a clue\". The Post also looked for the fake cover at two Trump courses in the United States that are open to the public, in the Bronx and in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. It was not on display at either. The rest of Trump\\'s courses are members-only, making it difficult to get inside to look at the decor. The image does not appear to be among the many framed magazine covers that adorn Trump\\'s old office in Trump Tower, based on photos of the office.   One thing that is clear, from the President\\'s past statements, is that he views the cover of Time as a significant honour. Trump has bragged that he\\'s been on more Time covers than anyone. \"I think we have the all-time record in the history of Time magazine,\" he said during a January speech at CIA headquarters. That is wrong. Richard Nixon has appeared on far more than Trump. In a 2016 interview, when Trump was a candidate, he offered a mental tally of how many times he had appeared on the magazine\\'s cover. \"I think I was on the cover of Time magazine twice in my life and, like, six times in the last number of months. So you tell me, which is more important, real estate or politics, okay?,\" Trump said. \"I have six for politics and I have two for real estate or whatever they put me on for.\"   But that count was wrong. According to Time magazine\\'s tally, Trump had been on the cover only once before he got into politics. That was in January 1989.

I will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.” Six months later, as Trump was about to be sworn in, biker Cox and his group pledged to form a “wall of meat” – a sea of men standing arm to arm – to protect him from inauguration protesters. Cox’s Facebook group, which gathers 200,000 followers, states as their mission to “help elect Donald Trump president of the United States”. Mission accomplished. But “the bikers”, as Trump has lovingly referred to them – those “who have been so good to me, fantastic people who truly love our country” – are not a single group revving one Trump engine. Even among those who ride President Trump’s pick of the most emblematic American made-in-the US macho machine, there are stark differences.    A Harley-Davidson Dyna Super Glide motorcycle. Photograph: Ian Langsdon/EPA  The politics of motorcycle enthusiasts are as diverse as the ways in which they customize their bikes, according to Trump supporter and longtime Harley rider George Kovach, 64, of Oakland, California. “I might put a skull and crossbones on my bike,” Kovach says. “One guy could be a hippie-biker with a flower power sticker, and another might be one who’s just happy with money in his pocket and a beer in his hand. And the Bikers for Trump – most of them are veterans of one era or another,” he says, himself a Vietnam veteran and supporter of the group. It was Trump’s business savvy that swayed Kovach from his longtime Democratic affiliation. “Dude’s got a lot of issues, but one thing you’ve got to remember about Trump is he’s a businessman,” Kovach says. “I can tell you from a businessman’s standpoint, nowhere near the magnitude he is, that when you’re in business, your objective is to get the money from that person who walks through that door. And a successful businessman will be able to talk to a black man, a Latino, a Jewish person, a hippie … So I think of Trump along those lines, as being a mixed bag, but a businessman first and foremost.” Others have a more nuanced take. Rich Gibbon, a longtime rider and racer and president of the Mad Dog Oakland MC in the San Francisco Bay area, says Trump “is the village idiot. We know that. But if he can do some good somewhere, then I support anything positive that can come out of this train wreck.” Gibbon says that this good could come if Trump were to lift tariffs on motorcycles sold overseas as he initially promised, even as he left some baffled by signing an executive order to end the US participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership – which would have lifted these tariffs. “He’s a businessman, down to his 70s-era power handshake,” Gibbon says. He wants to exert strength, and I think he sees strength in Harley-Davidson. The Harley-Davidson riding community is about freedom of speech and freedom of expression, all those guaranteed freedoms … Harley-Davidson is very Americana. It’s visceral, it’s a little rough, and he’s attracted to that.”    Donald Trump jokes with reporters after greeting Harley-Davidson executives on the South Lawn of the White House. Photograph: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images  But even though Trump singled out Harley-Davidson in his first address to Congress, referring to the “five magnificent motorcycles on the lawn of the White House”, there are those who ride who plain just don’t like him. One of those bikers is George Christie, a former longtime president of the Ventura, California, chapter of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club. “In my day, bikers valued freedom over everything, and were suspicious of any rich guy shilling for the ‘establishment’,” said Christie, in a recent blogpost titled Trumped on Two Wheels. “We didn’t support ‘law-and-order’ candidates because they were inevitably all for eroding our precious civil liberties. Most of us served in the military and knew the reality. In my day, we wouldn’t have given a second look to some soft, privileged, trust-fund mutt who deferred from the draft multiple times.”   Christie says that Trump’s years on The Apprentice help him gauge the mood of the public and give them what they want. “There’s a populist attitude we have right now,” Christie says, “and I think he saw how to tap into that … Twitter is an automatic weapon for him.” Also among “the bikers” are those who didn’t vote for either Trump or Hillary Clinton, but who support any economic incentives that would benefit US companies like Harley-Davidson. “Every time I listen to him, he irritates me,” says Jerry Aebi, 56, a Harley owner in Simi Valley, California. “But I like that he supports Harley and that he wants them to succeed. I think Trump is trying to appeal to a very ‘Made in America’ mindset that’s popular with bikers.” Even though the company invited the president to take a ride on one of the bikes parked on the White House lawn, the company might not be as enamored with Trump as he is with the brand. The president opposes H-1B visas that allow Harley-Davidson to hire outsourced labor abroad, as Harley does in India. The withdrawal of the US from the TPP also means that the company will “now of course … turn our attention to whatever bilateral trade agreements that could help level the playing field for Harley-Davidson,” according to Harley-Davidson’s CEO, Matt Levatich.   Still, the company remains a successful American powerhouse. Its stock rose 2.3% after Trump named the brand during his speech to Congress, and continues to rise. “Harley Davidson is the perfect brand for president Trump to associate himself with,” adds David Langton of Langton Creative Group. “It’s rugged, regular-guy, tough and not too elite. It’s not fussy (or Italian) like Moto Guzzi. It’s not the efficient machines of Yamaha or Honda (or Japanese). It’s all American. There is a short-term advantage for the brand to associate with Trump’s form of politics. But since Harley-Davidson has a long established brand they do need to be careful in aligning themselves with Trump. Because Harley-Davison is a long-term, quality brand and Trump, alas, isn’t.” Though the bikers Trump has appealed to might disagree on his ability to put his foot in his mouth – or “to be a real asshole”, as one rider said – they all agree that his dedication to building up American companies is something they can get behind. “There’s a camaraderie for two wheels out there, especially for Harleys,” says Jerry Aebi. “We’re going to give the peace sign to everyone on a two-wheeler.”   US President Donald Trump has praised US military equipment while speaking to the Coast Guard ahead of Thanksgiving, saying a new plane the Air Force was ordering was \"almost like an invisible fighter\". Mr Trump first mentioned the \"invisible\" jet when he discussed the F-35 stealth fighter at a military briefing in Puerto Rico, after Hurricane Harvey had hit. \"Amazing job … so amazing we are ordering hundreds of millions of dollars of new planes for the Air Force, especially the F-35. You like the F-35? ... you can\\'t see it. You literally can\\'t see it. It\\'s hard to fight a plane you can\\'t see,\" Mr Trump said in October.  \"That\\'s an expensive plane you can\\'t see. As you heard, we cut the price very substantially. Something that other administrations would never have done — that I can tell you.\" While speaking to the Coast Guard, Mr Trump said he had discussed the jet with \"Air Force guys\", asking if it would perform as well in a dogfight as those in a movie. \"The Navy, I can tell you, we\\'re ordering ships, with the Air Force I can tell you we\\'re ordering a lot of planes, in particular the F-35 fighter jet, which is almost like an invisible fighter,\" he said. \"In a fight, you know a fight like I watch on the movies ... how good is it?\" he recalled asking.  \"They said, \\'Well, it wins every time because the enemy cannot see it, even if it\\'s right next to it\\'.\" The F-35, plagued by development problems and cost overruns, is in fact not invisible to people nearby. Its stealth technology is designed to evade detection by radar and other sensors. \\'Nobody has the equipment we have,\\' Trump boasts Mr Trump also said his administration was \"building up wealth\" to spend more on the military. \"Nobody has the equipment that we have. And it\\'s sad when we\\'re selling our equipment to other countries but we\\'re not buying it ourselves,\" he said. \"But now that\\'s all changed. And I said, the stuff that we have is always a little bit better too. When we sell to other countries, even if they\\'re allies you never know about an ally. An ally can turn. You\\'re going to find that out.  \"But I always say make lives a little bit better. Give it that extra speed, a little bit — keep a little bit — keep about 10 per cent in the bag … nobody has what with we have.\"  Throughout the day — at events and on Twitter — Mr Trump boasted about the economy\\'s performance since he took office, pointing to recent stock market gains and the unemployment rate, along with his efforts to scale back regulations and boost military spending.  ABC/AP   Posted\\xa023 Nov 2017 Thu 23 Nov 2017 at 10:56pm, updated\\xa024 Nov 2017 Fri 24 Nov 2017 at 1:13am   President Trump on Tuesday sought to sanitize the stench of hate surrounding a deadly white nationalist rally in Virginia, calling armed, torch-carrying protesters clad in Nazi gear \"very fine people\" looking to protect their history. Trump, in a return to his statement from Saturday, cast blame for the outbreak of savagery on \"both sides\" and shrugged off the evil nature that made up the core of the white supremacist groups in the crowd at the \"Unite the Right\" event. \"You had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest and very legally protest,\" the President said of the sea of people who chanted Nazi slogans, carried swastikas and wore combat gear. Trump, speaking at a hastily called press conference on infrastructure in the lobby of his Fifth Ave. skyscraper, stood defiant in the face of criticism that he was too soft or slow to condemn the neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan and other white power groups that gathered to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. \"I don\\'t know if you know, they had a permit,\" a defensive Trump added in an attempt to justify the gathering. \"The other group didn\\'t have a permit. So I only tell you this. There are two sides to a story.\" Rally organizers were clear about their objectives ahead of the chaotic event — which claimed the life of 32-year-old paralegal Heather Heyer and two state troopers.    President Trump defending demonstrators in Charlottesville, saying they were focused on a statue of Robert E. Lee. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)    \"The biggest thing is a show of strength,\" Matthew Heimbach said leading up to the rally. \"To show that our organizations that have been divided on class, been divided on religious issues, divided on ideological grounds, can put into 14 words — \\'We must secure the existence of our people and the future for white children\\' — as our primary motivating factor.\" Organizer Jason Kessler told The Associated Press last week that it was \"about an anti-white climate within the Western world and the need for white people to have advocacy like other groups do.\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Chairman Gary Cohn, both of whom are Jewish, stood awkwardly behind the President as he defended self-proclaimed white nationalists. Trump tried to cast attendees as proud history buffs just looking to preserve a local statue of Lee, while those opposing them were the \"alt-left.\" \"So this week, it\\'s Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson\\'s coming down. Is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after. You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\" he said.    Front page of Wednesday\\'s New York Daily News.     Trump did not differentiate between Washington and Jefferson as Founding Fathers who helped form the United States and Lee and Jackson as leaders of a rebellion that tried to destroy it. He said that local municipalities should be in charge of deciding whether monuments linked to the Confederacy and slavery remain in place or are brought down. Though the reason for choosing Charlottesville is linked to the statue, the event acted as a gathering point for different far-flung right-wing fringe groups to spread hate. Among chants repeatedly shouted during marches around the city was the phrase \"blood and soil,\" a reworking of a famous slogan used by the Third Reich in 1930s and 1940s Germany. Attendees included white nationalist Richard Spencer and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, though Trump said Tuesday that he was unaware at the time of his first statement that Duke had been there.    White nationalist demonstrators use shields as they guard the entrance to Lee Park in Charlottesville, Va., Saturday. (Steve Helber/AP)    The commander-in-chief\\'s sympathy for the radical edges of society was a return to his original comments after the death of Heyer, when he said that \"many sides\" were behind the violence, which drew heavy criticism. Leaders from across the political spectrum criticized his abandonment of American values, and Trump changed his rhetoric Monday when he condemned \"evil racism\" and singled out white supremacists for the first time. Trump said he was simply waiting to gather the facts during his first statement, and slammed neo-Nazi James Fields, who faces a murder charge for running over Heyer as she marched with counterprotesters. \"I think the driver of the car is a disgrace to himself, his family and this country. You can call it terrorism. You can call it murder. You can call it whatever you want,\" Trump said Tuesday. The brief moments of condemnation for the hate that led to crowds of people with torches marching through an American city did not last long.    Heather Heyer was killed when a white supremacist drove into a crowd at the Charlottesville rally. (GoFundMe)    He blamed \"both sides\" for the violence, correctly noting that some of the counterprotesters were armed with clubs and had been looking for trouble, while portraying those who were protesting with torches and shouting anti-Jewish slogans as \"people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.\" Trump\\'s White House team believed that he would take no questions at the Tuesday event, and watched him go \"rogue\" in front of the press, a senior official told NBC. Members of his staff were reportedly stunned when he espoused his views off-the-cuff. The President also spent time defending his adviser Steve Bannon, a self-professed nationalist who many suspected had influenced him into a muted response on the violence. The President said that Bannon was a friend and \"not a racist,\" but also distanced himself by saying he was a late campaign addition.    Trump called the white nationalists at the Charlottesville rally \"very fine people.\" (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)    \"We\\'ll see what happens with Mr. Bannon,\" he said. The emergence of Nazi and white supremacist groups into the political spotlight had fueled outrage since the beginning of the Charlottesville demonstrations Friday night, but the President\\'s speech spurred a new jolt of anger. Around 500 protesters were gathered outside Trump Tower on Tuesday evening, continuing demonstrations that started when he returned to his Manhattan home on Monday. \"This plays to the darkest elements of our society,\" Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, resident Dianette Gilmore told the Daily News. \"He reaches into the recesses and gives them the power to come out. We cannot let him win, we cannot let them win.\"    James Fields Jr. (c.) of Maumee, Ohio, holds a shield associated with the hate group Vanguard America as he and others stand in front of the statue of Robert E.

Fields was later arrested for plowing his car into a group of counter-protesters, killing a 32-year-old woman and injuring at least 19 other people. (Go Nakamura For York Daily News)   Politicians on both sides of the aisle issued new condemnations of the President. \"There are no \\'very fine\\' white supremacists, Mr. Trump,\" Gov. Cuomo said on Twitter. \"Mr. President, you can\\'t allow #WhiteSupremacists to share only part of blame. They support idea which cost nation & world so much pain,\" Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said. Spencer and Duke, however, approved of the speech. \"Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftists terrorists,\" Duke said.

But there\\'s one group of people with whom President Donald Trump is still hugely popular.    After his first weeks in office, his approval rate among Republicans of 86% is second only to that of George W Bush among all of the party\\'s presidents elected in the last 65 years.    So what are the things that they like so much?    \\'I\\'m going to make a lot of money\\' - the investor    Despite being a Republican, property developer John Delia says he was \"too embarrassed\" to vote for Mr Trump in November\\'s election because of the controversy about his candidacy.   But he says he was \"relieved\" to see the New York billionaire win the race - and what has happened since has pleased him even more.   Mr Trump\\'s platform of new jobs, American business and economic renewal has sent the US stock market to record highs. It is investors like Mr Delia who are feeling richer as a result.   \"I invest in the stock market and I have succeeded in the short term,\" says the 26-year-old, based in Columbus, Ohio.    \"Investors are definitely feeling more confident. They think Donald Trump is going to bring more jobs and infrastructure, and help us move forward.\"   From a business perspective, he says he is not fazed about allegations of improper ties to Russia, legal challenges to Mr Trump\\'s travel ban, or complaints about racist rhetoric from the administration.    \"Yes, he\\'s a bigot but at least you are aware,\" says Mr Delia of the US president. \"He speaks honestly.   \"No matter what happens, most investors just want to make money. We are not going to pay attention to the drama. We\\'re just trying to stay ahead of the curve.\"    And it is especially Mr Trump\\'s promise to \"clean up\" America\\'s inner cities that makes Mr Delia, who started his own property portfolio at 20, feel positive about the future. He hopes investment will pour into his own urban development projects.   \"I think I\\'m going to make a lot of money,\" he says.     \\'I\\'ll keep my job\\' - the coal miner     Image source, EPA Image caption, President Trump made revival of the coal industry a key campaign pledge     The next interviewee asked to remain anonymous, because he says the polarised political climate in the US has left him feeling \"a bit paranoid\".   \"I often feel the country is being torn about and being a white/Christian/conservative makes you a hater and a racist,\" he says.   But in a social media conversation spanning several days, the 36-year-old coal miner from Indiana explained how Mr Trump\\'s presidency was having a direct impact on his life.   Before the election, the father-of-four says he expected to lose his job in coal within five years, but with Mr Trump in office \"it could be as many as 15\".   He puts this down to the president\\'s cancelling of an Obama-era environmental regulation known as the \"stream protection rule\". The bill put restrictions on coal companies wanting to expand and tried to stop them dumping mining waste into streams and waterways.   While environmentalists point out that the rise of cheap natural gas has contributed largely to decline in the US coal industry, the Indiana coal miner we spoke to says the policy put a \"stranglehold on coal companies\".   \"During 2016 our company was in the process of getting permits to strip some land that would add life to the mine,\" he says.   \"The permitting process was put on hold concerning a impact study on the land. Management told the miners that if we didn\\'t get any new permits and most of them were on hold indefinitely, we would be out of work in a few years.\"   Now Mr Trump has lifted the rule, he feels \"hopeful\" that he will be able to continue the work done by his great-grandfathers for years to come.   \"Some people really dislike the coal industry... but it\\'s the best paying job around and I\\'m blessed to be able to work and support my family.\"    \\'More control over healthcare\\' - the retiree    Marilyn De Reggi was diagnosed with stage three colon cancer just a month before her late husband, Aime, had his first stroke.    The 76-year-old says her experience of having to \"fight hard\" for him - while being unwell herself - left her with a low estimation of government-subsidised healthcare.    She welcomes Mr Trump\\'s efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare as \"extremely important\". And while she also supports Mr Trump\\'s tough immigration policies, she sees his push of an alternative system as one of the best things he\\'s done so far.    Media caption, What\\'s in the Republican healthcare bill?     The Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, helped 20m previously uninsured Americans get health insurance by making it a legal requirement.   However, increases in insurance premiums - which were also a problem before the health law - have irked many Americans. Critics have also decried it as an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of private businesses and individuals.   Mrs De Reggi, a retired musician and teacher who lives just outside Washington DC in Maryland, says the cost of President Obama\\'s signature healthcare plan has left younger members of her family struggling.    And although medical costs for her and her late husband were covered by Medicare (a different government-run programme available to elderly patients), this made her \"very aware\" of the problems with federal involvement.   \"I encountered the worst of care with my husband and the limitations of government making decisions for you,\" she says.    The couple went through \"a lot of savings\" after Aime was denied access to certain sorts of care under Medicare because of his age and condition, she says. Instead they had to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to secure the treatment they wanted.   She is now against \"the government making medical choices\". \"I\\'m interested in a programme gives people a choice and where there aren\\'t committees that decide what happens to you at a certain age,\" she adds.    \\'A conservative on the Supreme Court\\' - the lawyer    \"I think the thing that [Mr Trump] has done so far that will have the greatest long term impact on the law is the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court,\" says David Rogers, a housing lawyer from Texas.    \"I think he brings predictability in the law. The law is not going to change dramatically and that is good.\"   The Supreme Court has the final legal word on many of the most sensitive US issues. Conservatives celebrated the selection of Judge Gorsuch to fill an empty seat on the bench because of his views on issues such as birth control and euthanasia.    But it is his approach to gun rights that particularly pleases Mr Rogers.    The 52-year-old says he expects the judge to protect the Second Amendment - which guarantees the rights of people to keep and bear arms - because he is known to maintain a strict interpretation of the US Constitution.   \"I believe in guns,\" says Mr Rogers. \"Going to the gun range is something I do at the weekend with my children... With Gorsuch, I feel like I don\\'t need to worry that\\'s going to be taken away.\"   Judge Gorsuch\\'s appointment still needs to be confirmed by the Senate. But if it goes ahead, \"Washington isn\\'t going to actively make my life harder\", says Mr Rogers.    \"Gun rights feel safer under Trump.\"   '"

       "'   President Trump boasted in a fundraising speech Wednesday that he made up\\xa0information in a meeting with the leader of a top U.S. ally, saying he insisted to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the United States runs a trade deficit with its neighbor to the north without knowing whether that was true.  “Trudeau came to see me. He’s a good guy, Justin. He said, ‘No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,’ ” Trump said, mimicking Trudeau, according to audio of the private event in\\xa0Missouri obtained by The Washington Post. “Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in — ‘Donald, we have no trade deficit.’ He’s very proud because everybody else, you know, we’re getting killed. “... So, he’s proud. I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know.\\xa0... I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid. … And I thought they were smart. I said, ‘You’re wrong, Justin.’ He said, ‘Nope, we have no trade deficit.’ I said, ‘Well, in that case, I feel differently,’ I said, ‘but I don’t believe it.’ I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, ‘Check, because I can’t believe it.’ ‘Well, sir, you’re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn’t include energy and timber. … And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.’ It’s incredible.”    President Trump boasted to donors that he told Canada\\'s prime minister that the U.S. has a trade deficit with Canada, despite having \"no idea\" if that was true. (Video: Reuters)    The Office of the United States Trade Representative says the United States has a trade surplus with Canada.  It reports that in 2016, the United States exported $12.5 billion more in goods and services than it imported from Canada, leading to a trade surplus, not a deficit. In response to this story, Trump on Thursday went on Twitter to reiterate his false assertion that the United States has a trade “deficit” with Canada and said it was other countries that refused to accept that such imbalances exist. In his 30-minute speech to donors in Missouri, Trump made a blistering attack against major U.S. allies and global economies, accusing the European Union, China, Japan and South Korea of ripping off the United States for decades and pillaging the\\xa0U.S. workforce. He also described the North American Free Trade Agreement as a disaster and heaped blame on the World Trade Organization for allowing other countries to box in the United States on trade. Trump\\xa0seemed to threaten to pull U.S. troops stationed in South Korea if he didn’t get what he wanted on trade with Seoul, an ally. He said that the country had gotten rich but that U.S. politicians never negotiated better deals.\\xa0“We have a very big trade deficit with them, and we protect them,” Trump said. “We lose money on trade, and we lose money on the military. We have right now 32,000 soldiers on the border between North and South Korea. Let’s see what happens.” “Our allies care about themselves,” he said. “They don’t care about us.”    President Trump on March 8 signed proclamations imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The tariffs initially won’t apply to Canada and Mexico. (Video: The Washington Post, Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)    Trump’s comments to donors that laid bare his approach to arguing trade facts with foreign leaders show how he might try to engage with other heads of state in the coming weeks. Trump has said he will impose tariffs on steel and\\xa0aluminum imports as soon as next week, a steep increase in duties that could affect some of the U.S. government’s biggest trading partners. Trump said countries can request exemptions from these tariffs but only after direct negotiations with him. The audio from the fundraiser shows how difficult these discussions\\xa0could prove. The president\\xa0was\\xa0in Missouri to\\xa0raise money for Josh Hawley, who is taking on Sen. Claire McCaskill (D) in November\\'s midterm election. He called McCaskill “bad for Missouri and bad for the country.” But he barely spoke about Hawley. Instead, he talked about himself — bragging about his 2016 election win and\\xa0lavishing praise on himself while ticking through a list of U.S. allies that he said are taking advantage of the United States. The president did not mention his abrupt firing earlier this week of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by tweet, the personnel turmoil engulfing his administration, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign or reports of his alleged affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels — and his lawyer paying her to keep silent about the relationship. Trump\\xa0spoke as his White House tried to pick up the pieces after Democrats\\' apparent victory\\xa0in a special election in a western Pennsylvania congressional district that Trump won by 20 points in 2016. Pollsters said the results showed how Trump was dragging down the Republican Party, but the president took none of the blame. He said the Republican candidate, Rick Saccone, would have lost by a wider margin without his support — Trump held a rally for Saccone over the weekend. And he said\\xa0the\\xa0Democrat, Conor Lamb, won\\xa0the seat because he was “like Trump” but that Lamb would vote with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Trump also described for donors his decision to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the coming months through the prism of making history and besting his predecessors while lamenting his media coverage, questioning U.S. allies and labeling his presidency as “virgin territory.”    President Trump agreed March 8 to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"by May.\" Here are three other big events in North Korean diplomacy. (Video: Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)    “They couldn’t have met” with Kim, he said, after mocking presidents Barack Obama and\\xa0George W. Bush. “Nobody would have done what I did.” “It was called appeasement: Please don’t do anything,” he said of other presidents. “They say, ‘Maybe he’s not the one to negotiate,’ ” he said, mocking the voice of a news anchor. “He’s got very little knowledge of the Korean Peninsula. Maybe he’s not the one. ... Maybe we should send in the people that have been playing games and didn’t know what the hell they’ve been doing for 25 years.” The through lines of\\xa0Trump\\'s meandering speech were simple: Trump was tougher than all the rest, and the United States was not going to be laughed at or taken advantage of. He accused Japan of using gimmicks to deny U.S. auto companies access to its consumers, said South Korea was taking advantage of outdated trade rules even though\\xa0its economy was strong and said China had single-handedly rebuilt itself on the back of its trade surplus with the United States. \"It\\'s called the bowling ball test; do you know what that is? That\\'s where they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car,\" Trump said of Japan. \"And if the hood dents, then the car doesn\\'t qualify. Well, guess what, the roof dented a little bit, and they said, nope, this car doesn\\'t qualify. It\\'s horrible, the way we\\'re treated. It\\'s horrible.\" It was unclear what he was talking about. Trump\\xa0said he didn’t even want Japan to pay the tariffs but to build more automobiles in the United States, adding that Japan would do so if tariffs were imposed. There is no evidence of such a possibility as of now. His comments were among his most protectionist to date and didn’t identify a single benefit the United States receives from its trading relationships. The “free-trade globalists,” he said, are against his trade moves because “they’re worldly people, they have stuff on the other side.” Gary Cohn, the president’s top economic adviser, recently quit over the tariffs and was derisively labeled by his critics as a globalist. Trump\\xa0mocked other politicians for wanting to keep the North American Free Trade Agreement, calling Mexico “spoiled” and saying that Canada had outsmarted the United States.\\xa0“The best deal is to terminate it and make a new deal,” he said. Above all, he cast his presidency in historic terms, saying he was attracting so much media criticism because he was doing so well. He seemed fixated on his media coverage, even talking about a specific CNN segment with Erin Burnett. He said the news media was criticizing him for “conceding” a meeting with Kim. “They were afraid of being blown up. Then all of a sudden, they say, let’s not meet,” he said of reporters, referring to concerns that tensions between the United States and North Korea are increasing the chances of a military — and possibly nuclear — confrontation. While Trump said some decry his rhetoric and think his bellicose and mercurial tendencies could lead the United States into a war, he explained why he taunted the North Korean president as “Little Rocket Man.” He said the South Koreans told him that Kim was agreeing to meet because of the tough U.S. sanctions and that they promised not to conduct any nuclear tests or missile launches until a meeting occurred. That comment could not be verified. “He’s going to get us in a war,” he said, again mocking a news anchor. “You know what’s going to get us in a war\\xa0is weakness.” He said Republicans needed to run on their tax bill this year, but he was determined to not call it “tax reform,” as many other Republicans have done. He said Democrats would not appoint judges whom Republicans like while reversing tax cuts and taking away guns, an unproven claim. He implicitly rebuked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) for not changing the rules of the Senate to require only 51 votes\\xa0to pass\\xa0any legislation, saying more Republicans were needed because the current leadership would not act and no one could explain why the 60-vote status quo made sense. Trump criticized judges in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, saying his presidency would reshape the judiciary and change courts such as that one. He said he planned to pick 145 judges and thanked Obama for leaving so many vacancies. At the end of the day, the event, as it usually is with Trump, was about marketing. He said Republicans needed to run on tax cuts because they were very “popular.” “Do me a favor: Don’t call it tax reform. It hasn’t worked in 45 years,” Trump said he told others. “You say you’re reforming taxes, that means taxes could go up.” “I actually said, ‘Let’s call it the Tax Cut Cut Cut plan,’ ” Trump said. “I actually did.” He added: “They thought it sounded a little hokey, so we called it the tax cut and jobs plan. I liked the first one better.”  This story has been updated.      The Trump administration came under fire Thursday after President Trump delivered a fundraising speech in which he railed against U.S. allies as untrustworthy and boasted that he had made up information about the U.S. trade deficit in a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In a 30-minute speech to donors in Missouri, Trump made a blistering attack against the European Union, China, Japan and South Korea, accusing them of ripping off the United States for decades and pillaging the U.S. workforce, according to a recording of the private event obtained by The Washington Post. He also seemed to threaten to pull U.S. troops stationed in South Korea if he didn’t get what he wanted on trade with Seoul, an ally.   Trump and White House officials on Thursday defended the off-the-cuff remarks, which come as the administration seeks to renegotiate major trade agreements, impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and engage in high-stakes negotiations with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. “The president was accurate because there is a trade deficit and that was the point he was making,” said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who later referred to a figure that includes only goods and not services. “He didn’t have to look at the specific figures.” Some of Trump’s most pointed remarks were aimed at Trudeau, saying he insisted to the Canadian leader that the United States runs a trade deficit with its neighbor to the north without knowing whether it was true. “Trudeau came to see me. He’s a good guy, Justin. He said, ‘No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,’ ” Trump said, mimicking Trudeau, according to audio of the private event in Missouri obtained by The Washington Post. “Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in — ‘Donald, we have no trade deficit.’ He’s very proud because everybody else, you know, we’re getting killed. “ ... So, he’s proud. I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know . .\\u2009.\\u2009. I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid.” Then, Trump claimed that a staffer told him he was correct. ‘Well, sir, you’re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn’t include energy and timber . .\\u2009.\\u2009. And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.’ It’s incredible.” In fact, the Office of the United States Trade Representative says the United States has a trade surplus with Canada.It reports that in 2016, the United States exported $12.5 billion more in goods and services than it imported from Canada, leading to a trade surplus, not a deficit. In response to this story, Trump on Thursday went on Twitter to reiterate his assertion. “We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive),” he tweeted. “P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S. (negotiating), but they do ... they almost all do ... and that’s how I know!” In Ottawa, Canadian government spokesmen repeated U.S. government statistics pointing out that Canada has a trade surplus with their American neighbor. “Canada and the United States have a balanced and mutually beneficial trading relationship,” said Adam Austen, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, pointing to official U.S. statistics. The Canadian ambassador to Washington, David McNaughton, tweeted a similar message, adding that the figure included energy and lumber — countering Trump’s insistence otherwise. Bruce Heyman, U.S. ambassador to Canada under President Obama, wasn’t as charitable.  The president was in Missouri on Wednesday night to raise money for Josh Hawley, who is taking on Sen. Claire McCaskill (D) in November’s midterm election. He called McCaskill “bad for Missouri and bad for the country,” but he barely spoke about Hawley. Instead, he talked about himself — bragging about his 2016 election win and lavishing praise on himself while ticking through a list of U.S. allies that he said are taking advantage of the United States. He described the North American Free Trade Agreement as a disaster and heaped blame on the World Trade Organization for allowing other countries to take advantage of the United States on trade. He said South Korea had gotten rich but that U.S. politicians never negotiated better deals. “We have a very big trade deficit with them, and we protect them,” Trump said. “We lose money on trade, and we lose money on the military. We have right now 32,000 soldiers on the border between North and South Korea. Let’s see what happens.” “Our allies care about themselves,” he added. “They don’t care about us.” Trump spoke as his White House tried to pick up the pieces after a special election in a western Pennsylvania congressional district that Trump won by 20 points in 2016.

Maybe he’s not the one . .\\u2009.\\u2009. Maybe we should send in the people that have been playing games and didn’t know what the hell they’ve been doing for 25 years.” He also railed against China’s trade practices and, in one puzzling anecdote, accused Japan of using gimmicks to deny U.S. auto companies access to its consumers. “It’s called the bowling ball test; do you know what that is? That’s where they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car,” Trump said in reference to Japan. “And if the hood dents, then the car doesn’t qualify. Well, guess what, the roof dented a little bit, and they said, nope, this car doesn’t qualify. It’s horrible, the way we’re treated. It’s horrible.” It was unclear what he was talking about. His comments were among his most protectionist to date and didn’t identify a single benefit the United States receives from its trading relationships. The “free-trade globalists,” he said, are against his trade moves because “they’re worldly people, they have stuff on the other side.” Gary Cohn, the president’s top economic adviser, recently quit over the tariffs and was derisively labeled by his critics as a globalist. Alan Freeman in Ottawa and Erica Werner in Washington contributed to this report.    Donald Trump bragged that he made up facts in a meeting with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, according to an audio recording obtained by the Washington Post. The US president – notorious for making false claims on countless issues – admitted he told Trudeau that America has a trade deficit with its neighbour when he “had no idea” if that was true. The office of the US trade representative states that the American goods and services trade surplus with Canada was $12.5bn in 2016. According to the recording, Trump told guests at a fundraising dinner in Missouri: “Trudeau came to see me. He’s a good guy, Justin. He said, ‘No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please.’ “Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in – ‘Donald we have no trade deficit.’ He’s very proud because everybody else, you know, we’re getting killed … So he’s proud. I said, ‘Wrong Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know … I had no idea. “I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid … And I thought they were smart.”   Trump went on: “I said, ‘You’re wrong Justin.’ He said, ‘Nope, we have no trade deficit.’ I said, ‘Well, in that case I feel differently,’ I said, ‘but I don’t believe it.’ I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, ‘Check because I can’t believe it.’ ‘Well, sir, you’re actually right. We have no deficit but that doesn’t include energy and timber … And when you do, we lose $17bn a year.’ It’s incredible.” The Office of the United States Trade Representative has said the US has a trade surplus with Canada, the Post reported. Trump and Trudeau, 25 years apart in age and polar opposites in temperament, have projected warm relations so far. Last year, in honour of Canada Day, the president used Twitter to praise his “new found friend” north of the border. Trump defied critics in his own Republican party last week to announce stiff import taxes on steel and aluminium, risking a trade war with China and the European Union. His top economic adviser Gary Cohn quit over the tariffs, while secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who also disagreed with them, was fired earlier this week. On Wednesday, the Post report says, the president again lambasted the EU, China, Japan and South Korea, which he claimed were taking advantage of America. He also described the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) as a disaster and appeared to threaten to pull US troops out of South Korea if the country does not come up with a satisfactory trade deal. “We have a very big trade deficit with them, and we protect them,” Trump was quoted as telling donors. “We lose money on trade, and we lose money on the military. We have right now 32,000 soldiers between North and South Korea. Let’s see what happens.” He added: “Our allies care about themselves. They don’t care about us.”  After visiting a Boeing factory in St Louis earlier in the day, Trump was headlining a fundraiser for Republican US Senate candidate Josh Hawley, who is running for the seat held by Democrat Claire McCaskill. But as is his wont, the president boasted about his 2016 presidential election victory, derided cable news anchors and mocked his predecessors, George W Bush and Barack Obama, for failing to achieve what he has done by setting up a meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. “It’s called appeasement: please don’t do anything,” he reportedly said. Trump made 2,140 false or misleading claims in his first year as president, according to a Washington Post count.   President Donald Trump boasted in a fundraising speech Wednesday that he made up facts in a meeting with the leader of a top U.S ally, saying he insisted to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the United States runs a trade deficit with its neighbor to the north without knowing whether or not that was the case. \"Trudeau came to see me. He\\'s a good guy, Justin. He said, \\'No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,\\' \" Trump said, mimicking Trudeau, according to audio obtained by The Washington Post. \"Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in - \\'Donald we have no trade deficit.\\' He\\'s very proud because everybody else, you know, we\\'re getting killed. ... \"So he\\'s proud. I said, \\'Wrong Justin, you do.\\' I didn\\'t even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, \\'You\\'re wrong.\\' You know why? Because we\\'re so stupid. . . . And I thought they were smart.

Trump launched a blistering attack against major U.S. allies and global economies, accusing the European Union, China, Japan and South Korea of ripping off the United States for decades and pillaging the American workforce. He also described the North American Free Trade Agreement as a disaster and heaped blame on the World Trade Organization for allowing other countries to box the United States in on trade. He also seemed to threaten to pull U.S. troops stationed in South Korea if he didn\\'t get what he wanted on trade with Seoul, an ally. He said the country had gotten rich but United States politicians never negotiated better deals. \"We have a very big trade deficit with them, and we protect them,\" Trump said. \"We lose money on trade, and we lose money on the military. We have right now 32,000 soldiers on the border between North and South Korea. Let\\'s see what happens.\" \"Our allies care about themselves,\" he said. \"They don\\'t care about us.\" Trump\\'s rare comments that laid bare his approach to arguing trade facts with foreign leaders show how he might try to engage with numerous other heads of state in the coming weeks. Trump has said he will impose tariffs on steel and trade imports as soon as next week, a steep increase in duties that could impact some of the U.S. government\\'s biggest trading partners. Trump said countries can request exemption from these tariffs but only after direct negotiations with him. And the audio from the fundraiser shows how difficult these discussions might prove.

The president did not mention his abrupt firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by tweet, or the personnel turmoil that is swirling in Washington, or special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\\'s investigation into Russian interference, or reports of his affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels - and his lawyer paying her off. While his White House picked up the pieces after a Republican lost a special election in a western Pennsylvania congressional district that Trump won by 20 percent in 2016, and pollsters said the results showed how Trump was dragging down the Republican party, Trump took none of the blame. He said that the candidate, Rick Saccone, would have lost even bigger without him. And he said the Democrat, Conor Lamb, won the seat because he was \"like Trump\" but that he would vote with Pelosi. Trump was in Missouri to fundraise for Josh Hawley, who is taking on incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. He called McCaskill \"bad for Missouri, and bad for the country.\" But he barely spoke about Hawley. Instead, he talked about Trump - even bragging about his 2016 election win.

At a private fundraiser, he reportedly said he insisted to Mr Trudeau the US had a trade deficit with Canada, though he had \"no idea\" if it was true.   Mr Trump maintained in a tweet the US does have a trade deficit with Canada.   But the US Department of Commerce says the US ran a $2.8bn (Â£2bn) trade surplus with Canada in 2017.   On Thursday morning, Mr Trump defended his trade deficit stance.     We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesnâ\\x80\\x99t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and thatâ\\x80\\x99s how I know!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 15, 2018 \\n  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter     \"We do have a trade deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive),\" the US leader tweeted.    The Post said it had obtained audio from a 30-minute speech that Mr Trump gave at a private fundraiser in the US state of Missouri on Wednesday night.   Imitating the Canadian leader, Mr Trump reportedly said: \"Trudeau came to see me. He\\'s a good guy, Justin. He said, \\'No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please.\\'   \"Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in - \\'Donald, we have no trade deficit.\\' He\\'s very proud because everybody else, you know, we\\'re getting killed.\"   The president continued: \"I said, \\'Wrong, Justin, you do.\\' I didn\\'t even know. I had no idea. I just said, \\'You\\'re wrong.\\'\"    Media caption, Trump constantly worries about the trade deficit - should we?     Mr Trump then reportedly said he asked a member of his staff to check if the US did indeed have a deficit with its northern neighbour.   \"I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, \\'Check, because I can\\'t believe it,\\'\" Mr Trump said.   \"\\'Well, sir, you\\'re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn\\'t include energy and timber,\" said the president. \"And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.\\' It\\'s incredible.\"   That figure appears to refer to the US-Canada trade balance if services are removed from the calculation and only goods traded are accounted for, though Mr Trump\\'s tweet did not make this distinction.   The Canadian foreign ministry spokesman Adam Austin said in a statement: \"Canada and the United States have a balanced and mutually beneficial trading relationship.    \"According to their own statistics, the US runs a trade surplus with Canada.\"   Mr Trump typically does not include services when he talks about trade deficits - even though services represent about 80% of America\\'s economy. And Canada\\'s figures are slightly different, though Canada says that is because it uses a broader measure of exports.   However you measure it, the deficit is a small fraction of the hundreds of billions in business done between the two countries, says the BBC\\'s New York business reporter Natalie Sherman.   The White House has not yet commented on the report that the president made up figures during a discussion with a key US ally.    It is not clear when the meeting reportedly referred to by Mr Trump occurred.   US officials are currently attempting to negotiate an overhaul of the North American Free Trade Agreement with their counterparts in Canada and Mexico.      More on this story       President Trump made the shocking admission on Wednesday that he made up information during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. During a fund-raising speech in Missouri, Trump recalled contradicting Trudeau, who told him Canada didn\\'t have a trade deficit with the U.S. — even though he had \"no idea\" whether that was true. Trump, who was raising money for Republican Senate candidate Josh Hawley, said, \"I didn\\'t even know ... I had no idea. I just said, \\'You\\'re wrong.\\' You know why? Because we\\'re so stupid ... And I thought they were smart,\\'\" according to a recording obtained by the Washington Post. \"I said, \\'You\\'re wrong, Justin.\\' He said, \\'Nope, we have no trade deficit.\\' I said, \\'Well, in that case, I feel differently,\\' I said, \\'but I don\\'t believe it.\\' I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, \\'Check, because I can\\'t believe it,\\'\" Trump said. \"\\'Well, sir, you\\'re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn\\'t include energy and timber. … And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.\\' It\\'s incredible,\" Trump went on to say.

(Evan Vucci/AP)    The U.S. has a trade surplus with Canada, which was the country\\'s second largest trading partner in 2016, according to the Office of U.S. Trade Representative. Trudeau said Wednesday he was \"very optimistic\" going into talks with the U.S. and Mexico as they renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Speaking in a Bloomberg TV interview in Regina, Saskatchewan, Trudeau said there was an \"eminently achievable win-win-win\" result available, and that NAFTA has been good for all three countries. Trump has said he will impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, despite a world economic watchdog\\'s warnings that they will hurt economic growth globally.   President Trump boasted in a fundraising speech Wednesday that he made up facts in a meeting with the leader of a top U.S ally, saying he insisted to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the United States runs a trade deficit with its neighbor to the north without knowing whether or not that was the case. “Trudeau came to see me. He’s a good guy, Justin. He said, ‘No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,’” Trump said, mimicking Trudeau, according to audio obtained by the Washington Post. “Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in -- ‘Donald we have no trade deficit.’ He’s very proud because everybody else, you know, we’re getting killed.... “So he’s proud. I said, ‘Wrong Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know.... I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid…. And I thought they were smart. I said, ‘You’re wrong Justin.’ He said, ‘Nope we have no trade deficit.’ I said, ‘Well in that case I feel differently,’ I said, ‘but I don’t believe it.’ I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said ‘Check because I can’t believe it.’ “’Well, sir, you’re actually right. We have no deficit but that doesn’t include energy and timber…. And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.’ It’s incredible.” The United States trade representative office says the United States has a trade surplus with Canada. Trump launched a blistering attack against major U.S. allies and global economies, accusing the European Union, China, Japan and South Korea of ripping off the United States for decades and pillaging the American workforce. He also described the North American Free Trade Agreement as a disaster and heaped blame on the World Trade Organization for allowing other countries to box the United States in on trade. He also seemed to threaten to pull U.S. troops stationed in South Korea if he didn’t get what he wanted on trade with Seoul, an ally. He said the country had gotten rich but U.S. politicians never negotiated better deals. “We have a very big trade deficit with them, and we protect them,” Trump said. “We lose money on trade, and we lose money on the military. We have right now 32,000 soldiers on the border between North and South Korea. Let’s see what happens. “Our allies care about themselves,” he said. “They don’t care about us.” Trump’s rare comments that laid bare his approach to arguing trade facts with foreign leaders show how he might try to engage with numerous other heads of state in the coming weeks. Trump has said he will impose tariffs on steel and trade imports as soon as next week, a steep increase in duties that could affect some of the U.S. government’s biggest trading partners. Trump said countries can request exemption from these tariffs but only after direct negotiations with him. And the audio from the fundraiser shows how difficult these discussions might prove. In his 30-minute speech to donors in Missouri, Trump heaped praise on himself while ticking through a list of U.S. allies that he said were actually taking advantage of the United States. The president did not mention his abrupt firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by tweet, or the personnel turmoil that is swirling in Washington, or special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation into Russian interference, or reports of his affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels - and his lawyer paying her off. While his White House picked up the pieces after a Republican lost a special election in a western Pennsylvania congressional district that Trump won by 20 points in 2016, and pollsters said the results showed how Trump was dragging down the Republican Party, Trump took none of the blame. He said that the candidate, Rick Saccone, would have lost by an even bigger margin without him. And he said the Democrat, Conor Lamb, won the seat because he was “like Trump” but that he would vote with Pelosi. Trump was in Missouri to raise funds for Josh Hawley, who is taking on incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. He called McCaskill “bad for Missouri, and bad for the country.” But he barely spoke about Hawley. Instead, he talked about Trump -- even bragging about his 2016 election win. Trump described his decision to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un through the prism of making history and besting his predecessors while lamenting his media coverage, questioning the United States allies and labeling his presidency as “virgin territory.” “They couldn’t have met” with Kim, he said, after mocking former Presidents Obama and George W. Bush. “Nobody would have done what I did. “It’s called appeasement, please don’t do anything,” he said of other presidents. “They say, maybe he’s not the one to negotiate,” he said, mocking a voice of a news anchor. “He’s got very little knowledge of the Korean Peninsula. Maybe he’s not the one…. Maybe we should send in the people that have been playing games and didn’t know what the hell they’ve been doing for 25 years.” The through-lines of his meandering speech were simple: Trump was tougher than all the rest, and the United States was not going to be laughed at or taken advantage of. He accused Japan of using gimmicks to deny U.S. auto companies access to their consumers, said South Korea was taking advantage of outdated trade rules even though its economy was strong, and said China had single-handedly rebuilt itself on the back of its trade surplus with the United States. “It’s the bowling ball test. They take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and drop it on the hood of the car,” Trump said of Japan. “If the hood dents, the car doesn’t qualify. It’s horrible,” he said. It was unclear what he was talking about. He said he didn’t even want Japan to pay the tariffs but to build more automobiles in the United States, which he said Japan would do if tariffs were imposed. There is no evidence of such a possibility as of now. His comments were among his most protectionist to date and didn’t identify a single benefit the United States receives from its trading relationships. The so-called free-trade globalists, he said, are against his trade moves because “they’re worldly people, they have stuff on the other side.” Gary Cohn, the president’s top economic advisor, recently quit over the tariffs and was derisively labeled by his critics as a “globalist.” Trump mocked other politicians for wanting to keep the NAFTA, calling Mexico “spoiled” and saying that Canada had outsmarted the United States. “The best deal is to terminate it and make a new deal,” he said. Above all, he cast his presidency in historic proportions, saying he was attracting so much media criticism because he was doing so well. He seemed fixated on his media coverage, with much of his story-time about North Korea focused on how the media covered it, even talking about a specific CNN segment with Erin Burnett. He said the news media was criticizing him for “conceding” a meeting with Kim. “They were afraid of being blown up. Then all of a sudden, they say, let’s not meet,” he said of reporters. While Trump said some decry his rhetoric and think his bellicose and mercurial tendencies could bring the United States into a war, Trump explained why he taunted the North Korean president as “Little Rocket Man.” He said the South Koreans told him Kim Jong Un was agreeing to meet because of the tough United States sanctions and that they promised to not do any nuclear tests or missile launches until a meeting occurred. That comment could not be verified. “He’s going to get us in a war,” he said, again mocking a news anchor. “You know what’s going to get us in a war? Weakness.” He said Republicans needed to run on their tax bill this year, but he was determined to not call it “tax reform,” as many other Republicans have done. He said Democrats would not appoint judges that Republicans like while reversing tax cuts and taking away guns, an unproven claim. He implicitly rebuked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, (R-Ky.) for not changing the rules of the Senate so that only 51 votes were needed on all legislation, saying more Republicans were needed because the current leadership would not act and no one could explain why the status quo made sense. Trump criticized judges in the 9th Circuit, saying that his presidency would reshape the judiciary and change courts such as that one. He said he planned to pick 145 judges and gave a “thanks” to Obama for leaving so many vacancies. At the end of the day, the event, like it usually is with Trump, was about marketing. He said Republicans needed to run on tax cuts because they were very “popular.” “Do me a favor, don’t call it tax reform, it hasn’t worked in 45 years,” Trump said he told others. “You say, you’re reforming taxes, that means taxes could go up.” “I actually said, let’s call it the Tax Cut Cut Cut plan,” Trump said. “I actually did.” He added: “They thought it sounded a little hokey and called it something else. I liked the first one better.”   WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump boasted Wednesday that he once privately challenged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\\'s understanding of the trade balance between the two countries — without knowing the facts himself — and turned out to be right. Imitating Trudeau at a fundraiser for Missouri Republican Senate candidate Josh Hawley, Trump recounted the prime minister insisting during a meeting that the U.S. does not have a trade deficit with Canada. \"I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do.\\' I didn\\'t even know,\" Trump said, according to an audio recording of his remarks obtained by NBC News. \"I had no idea. I just said, \\'You’re wrong.\\' You know why? Because we\\'re so stupid. ... And I thought they were smart. I said, \\'You\\'re wrong, Justin.\\'\"     Then, in Trump\\'s telling, aides to the two men stepped out of the room, conferred and reported back. \"\\'Well, sir, you\\'re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn\\'t include energy and timber,\\'\" an American official explained to the two leaders, according to Trump\\'s telling. \"\\'And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.\\' It\\'s incredible.” Canadian and U.S. agencies calculate the balance differently. According to Statistics Canada, Canada runs a surplus, while the American Commerce Department reports the opposite. That suggests Trudeau may be using U.S. data to make his argument, while Trump might be relying Canadian data to make his. While Trump has told the basics of the story before, his ridicule of Trudeau, the head of government for one of America\\'s strongest allies and its northern neighbor, is a new twist. In Trump\\'s telling, which was first reported by The Washington Post, he out-maneuvered Trudeau in a leader-to-leader negotiation with what he thought might be a bluff. In a roughly 30-minute speech to several dozen Hawley donors, Trump also hinted that he might use the presence of U.S. troops in South Korea to force that nation to renegotiate its 2007 trade pact with the U.S. \"We have a very big trade deficit with them, and we protect them,\" Trump said. \"We have right now 32,000 soldiers on the border between North and South Korea. Let’s see what happens.\" Trump also credited himself for using a hawkish strategy to induce North Korea to enter talks about limiting its nuclear capabilities despite international concern that his rhetoric might provoke a confrontation. \"You know what\\'s going to get us into a war is weakness,\" Trump told the donors.  Sen. Claire McCaskill.Carolyn Kaster / AP file  On the domestic front, Trump lit into Hawley\\'s opponent, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Conor Lamb, the Pennsylvania Democrat who appears to have won a Tuesday special election in a district that favored Trump by 20 percentage points over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. \"Claire McCaskill is a guaranteed negative vote on every single thing that you people stand for and frankly that the vast majority of the people of Missouri stand for,\" Trump said. \"It is a negative vote for our country, and you have to defeat Claire McCaskill.\" Trump\\'s comments on Lamb echoed what he had said in campaigning for Republican Rick Saccone last Friday: The race was close because the Democrat had emulated Trump. \"He said oh, I\\'m like Trump. He said, you know, Second Amendment, everything. I love the tax cuts, everything. You wouldn\\'t have known. I mean it\\'s a pretty smart race actually,\" Trump said. In fact, Lamb opposed the Trump-GOP tax cuts, calling them a \"giveaway\" to the wealthy. Trump argued that if and when Lamb gets to Washington — some ballots are still being counted — he\\'ll be a rubber stamp for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.  Democratic congressional candidate Conor Lamb speaks during his election night rally in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday.Brendan McDermid / Reuters  That\\'s the case that Republicans and outside groups supporting Saccone made, seemingly to no avail, before voters went to the polls. For Trump, the main takeaway was that Lamb succeeded because he sounded like Trump. \"Last night the young man also, he ran on a campaign, he said very nice things about me,\" Trump said. \"I kept saying, \\'Is he a Republican?\\' He sounded like a Republican to me. But I guess when you’re popular in a certain area that’s probably a good tactic.\"  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n WaPo reporter gives details on Trump audio\\n \\n 01:41\\n \\n - Source:\\n CNN\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n  \\n Washington\\n CNN\\n \\xa0—\\xa0\\n \\n\\n \\n President Donald Trump boasted at a private fundraiser Wednesday of making up trade claims during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau before knowing whether they were true.\\n \\n \\n \\n “Trudeau came to see me.

It doesn\\'t. In fact, according to the U.S. Trade Representative in 2016, the U.S. had a $12.5 billion goods and services trade surplus with Canada. Trump sometimes ignores trade in services, which pumps up trade deficit numbers, but that isn\\'t an accurate way to look at the U.S. trade relationship with other countries.  As she tried to explain why Trump had been right all along, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders cited trade in goods alone, leaving out trade in services. Services make up a significantly larger share of the US economy than goods production. And it isn\\'t clear from Trump\\'s remarks whether that is really what he was talking about. \\n \\n  In the briefing I said I would provide the trade deficit number we have with Canada. In 2017 we had a $17.58 B trade deficit. In January 2018 we had a$3.63 B trade deficit. Both reflect trade in goods.

Those tariffs won\\'t immediately apply to Canada and Mexico, as those countries are in the midst of renegotiating, along with the U.S., the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Based on other comments, Trump is planning to leverage the threat of tariffs to negotiate better trade terms with U.S. trading partners.  \\n \\n It\\'s not clear how this admission that the president contradicted another world leader without basis will affect future negotiations or relationships with Trudeau and other leaders. A failure to agree on basic facts would seem to make such negotiations more difficult.  Asked by reporters during a photo opportunity in the Oval Office whether he has always been truthful with Trudeau, Trump ignored the question. But he is standing by his assertion that the U.S. has a trade deficit with Canada, tweeting Thursday morning, \"P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn\\'t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that\\'s how I know!\" \\n  We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive).

I just said, ‘You’re wrong,’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid. … And I thought they were smart. I said, ‘You’re wrong, Justin.’ He said, ‘Nope, we have no trade deficit.’ I said, ‘Well, in that case, I feel differently,’ I said, ‘but I don’t believe it.’”\\n \\n \\n “I didn’t even know…I had no idea.” (He really didn’t have any idea since the US, as Trudeau rightly said, operates at a trade surplus with Canada.)\\n \\n \\n On one level, this is the least surprising revelation ever. Trump said more than 2,000 things that were either misleading or totally false in his first year as president. Even before winning the White House – as a candidate for president and as a private citizen – he repeatedly demonstrated his casual disregard for truth and facts, often preferring the story he told himself to the one that comported with actual reality.\\n \\n \\n Someone like Trump who is forever telling himself a story of his life – a story in which he is always the hero – isn’t going to suddenly stop doing it just because he gets elected president. This is who Trump is. He could no more change it than make himself grow 5” taller by tomorrow.\\n \\n \\n And yet, despite the fact that no one should be surprised by the fact that Trump is winging it and making up facts to suit him, there are two things that should trouble anyone about this episode with Trudeau.\\n \\n \\n The first is the context. This isn’t Trump at a campaign rally saying he had the best first year of any president. Or demanding that his press secretary say that his inauguration crowd was historically large. Those exaggerations and lies aren’t great but they don’t carry any huge impact on the world stage. This is the president of the United States dealing with another world leader on the crucial issue of trade. \\n \\n \\n Fibbing – or knowingly playing fast and loose with the facts – when talking to foreign leaders, however, has real world consequences, not the least of which is that they may view Trump (and the broader US) as unreliable. And if you can’t trust what your allies are telling you, are they your allies anymore?\\n \\n \\n \\n The second impact of Trump’s comments to Trudeau is the seeming pride that Trump takes in either a) not knowing that we have a trade surplus with Canada or b) flat-out misleading Trudeau.\\n \\n \\n It’s one thing to do it. But to brag about it? To see misleading – whether willfully or unintentionally – the prime minister of Canada about our trade status as a point of pride? Something you should share with party donors because you think it will impress them? That’s some next level stuff. And you can be sure that every US ally (and enemy) is following this story and trying to calculate what it says about their relationship with America if Trump is willing to fudge facts with our neighbor to the north.\\n \\n \\n Trump’s disdain for facts and truth has turned into a punchline for many people. An eyeroll moment. But, what Trump did with Trudeau – and how he bragged later about what he did with Trudeau – is a very dangerous thing. In international diplomacy, trust is a critical factor. Lose it and you may never get it back.\\n \\n \\n Trump seems wholly unaware of that danger. Or, more grimly, he is aware of it – and simply doesn’t care.\\n \\n  \\n\\t\\n President Trump said at a fundraising dinner that he made up facts during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, The Washington Post reported Wednesday.\\nTrump told those at the dinner that he insisted that the U.S. had a trade deficit with Canada, but did not know if that was the case, according to leaked audio of the speech obtained by the Post.\\n“Trudeau came to see me.

We lose money on trade, and we lose money on the military,” Trump said. “We have right now 32,000 soldiers between North and South Korea.

In an interview with CNN\\'s Anderson Cooper on Thursday evening, Karen McDougal said Trump tried to pay her after the first time they had sexual relations. \"After we had been intimate, he tried to pay me, and I actually didn\\'t know how to take that,\" she said, clasping her hands together. She recalled how the cash offer left her shaken while Trump appeared surprised by her reaction. \"The look on my face must have been so sad,\" she said. She wondered, \"Does he think I\\'m in this for money? That\\'s not me.\" \"I\\'m not that kind of girl,\" she said she told him. His response: \"You\\'re really special.\" \\n \\n \\n McDougal recounted the specifics of the alleged affair. She first met Trump at the Playboy Mansion when he was filming an episode of Celebrity Apprentice. He said \"hello\" and seemed immediately smitten by the striking brunette, who bears more than a passing resemblance to his new wife at the time, Melania. He was direct in asking for her number and called \"right away.\" Over the next few days, they talked on the phone. She said she had many of Trump\\'s private phone numbers, including those of his bodyguard and his assistant. When asked what attracted her to Trump, she ticked off a list: He is a nice-looking man; he is sweet, funny, very charismatic; and his personality is \"wow!\" \"Great posture,\" she added. Their first \"date,\" she said gesturing with air quotes, took place at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on June 12, 2006, two days before Trump\\'s 60th birthday. She thought they were meeting for dinner in the tony hotel restaurant, but instead, Trump\\'s bodyguard ushered her into the reality star\\'s usual bungalow. \"I was concerned,\" McDougal confided to Cooper and the audience at large. \"At that moment, I realized maybe something else is going on.\" After some conversation, they had unprotected sex, she said. \\n According to McDougal, Trump said, \"I don\\'t like these things.\" It\\'s unclear whether she meant condoms or another form of contraception. That set a precedent for their future sexual encounters, of which she said there were \"many dozens.\" From June 2006 through April 2007, she said, \"We saw each other a minimum of five times a month up to bigger numbers,\" and each meeting involved some type of sexual intimacy. Throughout their relationship, Trump arranged their trysts, asking her to meet him all over the country in private and in public, she said. Mostly he would fly her out to meet him and put her up for the length of her stay, but he occasionally had her book her own travel and pay for herself, with the understanding that he would reimburse her later. That way there would be \"no paper trail,\" she said. She told Cooper that Trump didn\\'t seem to care whether people saw them together and didn\\'t seem conflicted about cheating on his wife. She said she visited him at his New Jersey home. Once, she said, he even took her to the apartment in Trump Tower where he lived with his wife and their young son, Barron. \"Aren\\'t you afraid to bring me here?\" \"They won\\'t say anything,\" Trump supposedly said. He showed her around the \"very gold\" apartment and pointed out Melania\\'s room, saying, \"She likes to get away to read.\" It was moments like this, McDougal said, that filled her with guilt and dread over the extramarital affair. \"Doing something wrong is bad enough, and when you\\'re doing something wrong and you\\'re in the middle of somebody else\\'s home or bed or whatever, that just puts a little stab in your heart,\" she said. Even worse was actually meeting Melania and posing for a picture with her, Trump and a handful of McDougal\\'s Playboy Playmate colleagues, she said. McDougal conceded it is possible Melania knew about the Playmate\\'s dalliance with Trump. \\n Still, she said she was very happy throughout the romance. She said that she loved Trump and that he loved her. He told her so \"all the time\" and had several pet names for her, including \"baby\" and \"beautiful Karen.\" One of her memories involves Trump favorably comparing her to his daughter Ivanka. \"He said I was beautiful like her,\" she told Cooper. Throughout the relationship, McDougal kept a journal recording her encounters with Trump. She said her sister and a handful of friends knew of their liaison. But, she told Cooper, she did not keep any texts, photos or messages documenting their relationship. At one point, Trump said he was remodeling an apartment as a Christmas gift for McDougal, she said. But she never saw it. \\n \\n McDougal said she was not aware that Trump allegedly had other paramours while they were involved, including adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who says she also had a fling with Trump. Stormy, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, is also suing to be able to tell her story. \"I thought I was the only one,\" McDougal said, adding that \"it makes sense. If he\\'s doing it behind his wife\\'s back, why would he not do it behind my back?\" In the end, McDougal said, she was overwhelmed by guilt and fear that the affair would become public. That feeling is what ultimately led her to end it, the same way it started, over the phone, she said. \"The excitement took over for a while, but I started feeling so bad about myself. ... It was tearing me apart in the long run. I knew I needed to get out,\" she said. McDougal delved into the lawsuit filed in a California court earlier this week that asks for her release from a contract she signed with American Media Inc. for her life rights. \\n Shortly after Trump won the Republican nomination, the model turned aspiring journalist promised to keep quiet about the supposed romance with Trump in exchange for $150,000 and a deal to write articles for some of the company\\'s magazines and appear on at least two covers. She explained to Cooper that she was happy to take the hush money. In fact, she said she was relieved that the story of the illicit affair would be buried and also thrilled about the opportunity to rebrand herself from former Playmate to lifestyle and fitness model. She said AMI and its owner, David Pecker, in particular, framed the deal as a means to \"jump-start\" her career and protect her image as \"wholesome and pure.\" At the time, she thought, \"It\\'s a win-win for me. I get the work, and my story doesn\\'t have to come out.\" Additionally, she felt a deep sense of loyalty to Trump both as a former lover and as a Republican. \"I voted for the president. That\\'s my party. That\\'s my president,\" she said. But things didn\\'t pan out the way she had anticipated. The company and Pecker, who is a longtime friend of Trump\\'s, failed to hold up their end of the bargain, according to McDougal. And now she wants out of the contract. \"I almost feel violated. I feel taken advantage of,\" she told Cooper. \"I feel like the contract was illegal, I was lied to, and I want to share my truth.\" \"I want my life rights back,\" she said. As NPR reported, AMI denies the accusations, and in a statement issued Tuesday, the company said, \"McDougal has been free to respond to press inquiries about her relationship with President Trump since 2016,\" adding that \"the suggestion that AMI \\'silenced\\' her is completely without merit.\" Still, McDougal said she fears financial ruin and hopes a legal judgment in her favor will release her from the deal with AMI. She has even offered to pay back the money she took. \\n She also offered an apology to Melania. \"I\\'m sorry,\" she said choking back tears. \"I wouldn\\'t want it done to me.\" \"I know it\\'s a wrong thing to do, but in those days, I was a different girl. I had fun. I was in the Playboy scene,\" she explained. In the years since her entanglement with Trump, she has returned to her roots and faith. \"I\\'m going to church. I\\'m involved in ministry,\" she said. Trump has not commented on any of McDougal\\'s claims, but the White House has denied the affair. \"I think somebody is lying, but I can tell you it\\'s not me,\" she said.\\n   Their first meeting was in Lake Tahoe, at a golf tournament in the summer of 2006. He invited her to dinner, she says. But when she got to his hotel room, it was clear he didn’t plan to go out.  “He was wearing pajama pants,” Stormy Daniels told InTouch magazine in 2011, describing what she said was a consensual sexual encounter with Donald Trump five years before. Trump has denied it ever happened.  In Daniels’s description, this was an unremarkable hookup between two people in the outer orbits of Hollywood fame. Daniels was a star of adult movies. Trump’s reality show, “The Apprentice,” was slumping. At this Lake Tahoe celebrity tournament, the organizers had given him only fifth billing, listing the real estate developer two spots below Ray Romano in their lineup of stars. Now, that casual night — and the connection it allegedly created between a future president and a porn star — has altered the course of Daniels’s life and threatens to alter the course of Trump’s presidency.  Days before the 2016 election, Daniels agreed to remain silent about the alleged encounter in exchange for a $130,000 payment arranged by Trump’s longtime attorney Michael Cohen, according to a court filing.  But in recent weeks, her story started leaking out. Last week, Cohen obtained a temporary restraining order from an arbitration judge barring Daniels from talking about the deal, according to people familiar with the matter. In response, Daniels sued the president, alleging that Trump and Cohen had tried to force her into silence with an invalid “hush agreement.” On Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reiterated Trump’s denial of an affair.  “The president has addressed these [allegations] directly and made very well clear that none of these allegations are true,” she said. Back on the night that started it all, Daniels has recalled, Trump didn’t say anything about keeping their encounter a secret. “He didn’t seem worried about it,” she told InTouch. “It did occur to me, ‘That’s a really stupid move on your part.’\\u2009” At the time of the golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, Trump had been married to his third wife, Melania, for a year and a half. Their son, Barron, was about 4 months old.   Trump turned 60 that summer. He spent much of it in California, where one of his favored haunts was the Beverly Hills Hotel, a pink stucco landmark, and the private bungalows on its lush grounds, according to people familiar with his visits. Some people come to Hollywood to start their TV careers: Trump had come to reboot his. “The Apprentice” had made him world famous, but after five seasons, its audience had declined. The show had shifted its location from New York’s Trump Tower to Beverly Hills as part of a broader reboot. Later, several women alleged that Trump made advances on them during this period — some of them unwanted.  Karen McDougal, a Playboy model, told The New Yorker that she began an affair with Trump when he was in Los Angeles around this time, recalling his repeated meals of steak and potatoes in his Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow. Another woman, Summer Zervos, has alleged in a lawsuit that Trump kissed and groped her in a 2007 encounter in a bungalow at the same hotel. In July 2006, Trump traveled to Lake Tahoe for the American Century Championship, a tournament dominated by former athletes and TV stars. “Grab the shades with heavy UV because the star power is blinding: Lance Armstrong, Michael Jordan, Ray Romano, Charles Barkley, Donald Trump,” the organizers announced. Trump was there for golf.  Daniels was there for work. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was 27. She had appeared in more than two dozen adult films and had begun to direct some herself. She told InTouch that a company she was working for, Wicked Pictures, had been paid to bring porn actresses to the golf tournament. Trump offered her a ride on his golf cart.  “That was actually my first time on a golf course,” Daniels told Adult Video News, a trade publication for the pornography industry, in August 2006. “And when you’re riding around with Donald Trump in an Escalade golf cart during your first time out on a course, I’d say I was doing all right.” Daniels has said that Trump invited her to his room, where she met a bodyguard named Keith. (Keith Schiller is the name of Trump’s longtime bodyguard, who later joined him for a period in the White House.) Inside the room, she said, she and Trump talked for a while before having sex. She said she wondered whether he would pay her, thinking to herself: “Please don’t try to pay me.”  “And then I remember thinking, ‘But I bet if he did, it would be a lot,’\\u2009” she told InTouch. Afterward, she said, he told her he would get her a slot on “The Apprentice.” “I’m gonna call you, I’m gonna call you. I have to see you again. You’re amazing. We have to get you on,” she recalled Trump saying. Another actress for Wicked Pictures, Jessica Drake, has also said Trump made advances on her that weekend. In an October 2016 news conference, Drake said that Trump invited her and two other women to his suite, where they found him wearing pajamas. He kissed the women each in turn, without their permission, Drake said. According to Drake, the group left Trump’s suite, but then a man called her and asked her to return alone. When she declined, Drake said, she was then called by Trump, who asked to her to come to his suite for dinner and a party. “What do you want?” she said he asked. “How much?” Later, she said Trump, or a man calling on his behalf, called again and offered $10,000 and the use of his private jet if she would come back. She said she declined again. In response to Drake’s allegations, Trump’s campaign issued a statement calling her account “totally false and ridiculous.” Drake and her lawyer, Gloria Allred, declined to comment for this story. As for Daniels, she said she kept in touch with Trump and saw him several more times, though she said they never again had sex. In one instance, she recalled visiting him at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where Trump watched the Discovery Channel’s “Shark Week” and spoke of his fear of sharks. Their relationship faded to a few phone calls and meetups at parties, Daniels told InTouch, and then faded away entirely sometime in 2009 or 2010.  She never got her shot on “The Apprentice.”  “He broke the news to me that it almost went through but there’s somebody that had a problem and it got vetoed and blah blah blah,” she told InTouch. “I was like, ‘I told you you couldn’t make it happen.’\\u2009” In the years after that, Daniels turned to directing, with dozens more credits to her name. In 2009, she contemplated a U.S. Senate bid in her home state of Louisiana but didn’t go forward. In May 2011, Daniels gave her interview to InTouch. But it didn’t run at the time. InTouch has not commented about why the story was held. The Associated Press reported that it had spoken to former InTouch staffers, who said that Trump’s attorneys had threatened to sue.  However, news of the alleged encounter appeared on a website called The Dirty in late 2011, prompting a cease-and-desist letter from an attorney for Daniels. After that, silence. Daniels said she kept the secret through Trump’s raucous, polarizing debut as a presidential candidate. But then, in the months before the election, she was in touch with reporters, including Jacob Weisberg, editor in chief of the Slate Group, seeking to tell her story. \\n Daniels had a lawyer, Keith Davidson, who was known for “pre-litigation” agreements, settlements intended to be sure that damaging allegations never see the light of day, according to people familiar with his work. Cohen, Trump’s longtime attorney, presented Davidson with a proposed agreement. He offered $130,000, she said, in exchange for her agreement to be silent again. (Cohen later acknowledged he “facilitated” the payment but declined to say what it was for.) Daniels took it, 11 days before the election. Then Trump won. Despite the agreement, the story burst into public view in recent weeks. First, the Wall Street Journal broke news of the payment to Daniels. Then, InTouch belatedly published its seven-year-old interview with the porn star. Daniels embarked on a tour of strip clubs around the country, capitalizing on her newfound fame.  But she said little about what actually happened back in the Lake Tahoe hotel room. Then, in recent days, two things changed. Cohen sought to pull Daniels into arbitration last week, arguing she had violated the terms of the 2016 agreement. Daniels’s new lawyer — an experienced litigator named Michael Avenatti — sued Trump on Tuesday, detailing some of Daniels’s claims in public court filings. The lawsuit laid out some details of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump and argued that the agreement meant to buy her silence was null because Trump had not signed it. Lawrence Rosen, an attorney for Cohen, said in a statement that he plans to fight the lawsuit and continues to “categorically refute the claims alleged by Ms. Clifford and her counsel.” Daniels’s lawsuit hints that she has more to reveal. And it raises the question: Did Trump know about the agreement to buy Daniels’s silence, days before the election? “Not that I’m aware of,” Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Wednesday. In an interview, Avenatti said he believes there’s no question that Trump knew. “Any suggestion that an attorney like Michael Cohen with his level of education and experience would pursue such an agreement, negotiate such an agreement, make the payment, and then proceed in this matter without his client’s knowledge is absurd,” Avenatti said. “As they say down South, that dog won’t hunt.” Beth Reinhard, Mark Berman, Alice Crites, Tom Hamburger and Paul Farhi contributed to this report.   In his 1987 classic The Art of the Deal, Donald Trump revealed that he’s a big proponent of “truthful hyperbole,” or what a layman would refer to as “lies.” “People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular,” he wrote. “It’s an innocent form of exaggeration—and a very effective form of promotion.” This, in other words, was clearly a man who had made a cottage industry out of lying through his caps. So in March 2018, it should surprise not a single person that when Trump opens his mouth, lies come flying out like the winged monkeys in The Wizard of Oz . Still, one might think that even he would know better than to publicly brag about lying to world leaders and U.S. allies. But, apparently, one would think wrong!  The Washington Post reports that during a Wednesday night fund-raiser in Missouri, ostensibly to raise money for Senate candidate Josh Hawley, the president of the United States regaled the crowd with a story about making up information during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, insisting that the U.S. has a trade deficit with its northern neighbors.  “Trudeau came to see me. He’s a good guy, Justin. He said, ‘No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,’” Trump said, mimicking Trudeau, according to audio of the private event in Missouri. “Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in—‘Donald, we have no trade deficit.’ He’s very proud because everybody else, you know, we’re getting killed.”   “. . . So, he’s proud. I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know. . . . I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid. . . . And I thought they were smart. I said, ‘You’re wrong, Justin.’ He said, ‘Nope, we have no trade deficit.’ I said, ‘Well, in that case, I feel differently,’ I said, ‘but I don’t believe it.’ I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, ‘Check, because I can’t believe it.’”   “‘Well, sir, you’re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn’t include energy and timber. . . . And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.’ It’s incredible.”  In fact, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, Trump was not right: the U.S. has a trade surplus with Canada. Yet for reasons unknown, he reiterated his point Thursday morning: Elsewhere during the 30-minute speech, Trump launched into his usual tirade about America’s allies taking us for a ride, telling the donors assembled that on his watch, the U.S. won’t get ripped off anymore. He described the North American Free Trade Agreement as a disaster, calling Mexico “spoiled,” and claiming that those slippery bastards in Canada had outsmarted us for the last time. He trashed the World Trade Organization for supposedly letting other countries take advantage of the U.S. on trade. At one point, he seemingly threatened to pull U.S. troops out of South Korea if Seoul, one of our allies, doesn’t give him what he wants on trade. (“We have a very big trade deficit with them, and we protect them,” he said. “We lose money on trade, and we lose money on the military. We have right now 32,000 soldiers on the border between North and South Korea. Let’s see what happens.”) At another point, he told a story about a test he claimed Japan performs on its cars, but which no one else has ever heard of. “It’s the bowling ball test,” he said. “They take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and drop it on the hood of the car. If the hood dents, the car doesn’t qualify. It’s horrible.”    U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly boasted that he made up facts while meeting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. (The Canadian Press)    Trump also called Mexico “spoiled” and said Canada had outsmarted the United States when it came to NAFTA. “The best deal is to terminate it and make a new deal,” he said.    President Donald Trump boasted in a fundraising speech Wednesday that he made up information in a meeting with the leader of a top U.S. ally, saying he insisted to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the United States runs a trade deficit with its neighbour to the north without knowing whether that was the case. “Trudeau came to see me. He’s a good guy, Justin. He said, ‘No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,’” Trump said, mimicking Trudeau, according to audio of the private event in Missouri obtained by The Washington Post. “Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in — ‘Donald, we have no trade deficit.’ He’s very proud because everybody else, you know, we’re getting killed. “… So, he’s proud. I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know. … I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid. … And I thought they were smart. I said, ‘You’re wrong, Justin.’ He said, ‘Nope, we have no trade deficit.’ I said, ‘Well, in that case, I feel differently,’ I said, ‘but I don’t believe it.’ I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, ‘Check, because I can’t believe it.’ ‘Well, sir, you’re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn’t include energy and timber. … And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.’ It’s incredible.” The Office of the United States Trade Representative says the United States has a trade surplus with Canada. In his 30-minute speech to donors in Missouri, Trump launched a blistering attack against major U.S. allies and global economies, accusing the European Union, China, Japan and South Korea of ripping off the United States for decades and pillaging the U.S. workforce. He also described the North American Free Trade Agreement as a disaster and heaped blame on the World Trade Organization for allowing other countries to box in the United States on trade.   Trump seemed to threaten to pull U.S. troops stationed in South Korea if he didn’t get what he wanted on trade with Seoul, an ally. He said the country had gotten rich but that U.S. politicians never negotiated better deals. “We have a very big trade deficit with them, and we protect them,” Trump said. “We lose money on trade, and we lose money on the military. We have right now 32,000 soldiers on the border between North and South Korea. Let’s see what happens.” “Our allies care about themselves,” he said. “They don’t care about us.”  Read more:   Trump’s new economic adviser called Trudeau a ‘left-wing crazy guy’ — but he sides with Canada on NAFTA, tariffs   Trump says ‘Canada is very smooth’ on trade, but he’s wise to its tricks   Trump’s economic advisers say he’s wrong: The U.S. has a trade surplus with Canada, not a deficit  Trump’s comments to donors that laid bare his approach to arguing trade facts with foreign leaders show how he might try to engage with other heads of state in the coming weeks. Trump has said he will impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports as soon as next week, a steep increase in duties that could affect some of the U.S. government’s biggest trading partners. Trump said countries can request exemptions from these tariffs but only after direct negotiations with him. The audio from the fundraiser shows how difficult these discussions could prove. The through lines of Trump’s meandering speech were simple: Trump was tougher than all the rest, and the United States was not going to be laughed at or taken advantage of. He accused Japan of using gimmicks to deny U.S. auto companies access to its consumers, said South Korea was taking advantage of outdated trade rules even though its economy was strong, and said China had single-handedly rebuilt itself on the back of its trade surplus with the United States. Trump said he didn’t even want Japan to pay the tariffs but to build more automobiles in the United States, adding that Japan would do so if tariffs were imposed. There is no evidence of such a possibility as of now. His comments were among his most protectionist to date and didn’t identify a single benefit the United States receives from its trading relationships. The “free-trade globalists,” he said, are against his trade moves because “they’re worldly people, they have stuff on the other side.” Gary Cohn, the president’s top economic adviser, recently quit over the tariffs and was derisively labelled by his critics as a globalist. Trump mocked other politicians for wanting to keep NAFTA, calling Mexico “spoiled” and saying that Canada had outsmarted the U.S. “The best deal is to terminate it and make a new deal,” he said.  U.S. President Donald Trump said he\\'ll only be \"tweaking\" NAFTA as it pertains to Canada, at a news conference with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday. Trudeau also met with Paul Ryan, U.S. Speaker of the House.   JOIN THE CONVERSATION   Anyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be a registered Torstar account holder.

Throughout the months that followed, the eight models were built outside of San Diego in Otay Mesa. President Trump didn’t miss his chance to see his vision unfold during his visit to California. On March 13, he visited the recently constructed 30-foot-tall prototypes and spoke to reporters on the implementation.\\n\\n\\n“If you don’t have a wall system, we’re not going to have a country,” he said. “There’s a lot of problems in Mexico. They have the cartels, and we’re fighting the cartels and we’re fighting them hard. Nobody [has] ever fought like we fought them.”\\n\\n\\nAfter checking out the prototypes, the president expressed his desire for height and see-through capabilities to make it easier for border agents to have a clear view on the other side. When it came to going high, Trump suggested illegal immigrants trying to cross over were super-skilled at scaling structures. He told reporters: “Getting over the top is easy. These are like professional mountain climbers. They are incredible climbers.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\n\\n\\nThe visit to see the U.S.-Mexico border samples sparked demonstrations with protesters assembled on both sides of the border. There were Trump piñatas and signs that read, “Trump, we will not pay for your wall.” People also took their sentiments to social media where comments erupted on the president’s “mountain climber” remarks.\\n\\n\\nLate-night hosts like Stephen Colbert also criticized the president’s border-wall prototypes, even touching on his interest in visibility. “See-through means that immigrants can see a better life, but they can’t touch it,” he said.\\n\\n\\nSince announcing his presidential run, Trump has insisted that Mexico would pay for the creation of the border wall, but Mexico’s president Enrique Peña Nieto has made it clear that Mexico will not give a peso toward this project. “I regret and condemn the decision of the United States to continue construction of a wall that, for years, has divided us instead of uniting us,” Peña Nieto said in a televised address in January. “Mexico doesn’t believe in walls.”\\n\\n\\n   President Donald Trump on Wednesday finally admitted that sometimes he just has no idea what he’s talking about. In audio recordings obtained by The Washington Post, Trump told a crowd at a Missouri fundraising event about a trade meeting he recently had with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in — ‘Donald, we have no trade deficit.’ He’s very proud because everybody else, you know, we’re getting killed,” Trump said, according to the Post. “So, he’s proud. I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid. … And I thought they were smart. I said, ‘You’re wrong, Justin.’ He said, ‘Nope, we have no trade deficit.’ I said, ‘Well, in that case, I feel differently,’ I said, ‘But I don’t believe it.’ I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, ‘Check, because I can’t believe it.’” Trump told his audience that he eventually admitted he was wrong, but he walked back the entire story in a tweet on Thursday.   We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that’s how I know!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 15, 2018     According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the U.S. actually has a trade surplus with Canada, though the truth is a bit more complicated. There are multiple methodologies for calculating trade figures, and by some estimates the U.S. does run a deficit. Canada’s own data even shows it comes out ahead. But as Bloomberg notes, “Whichever data is used, the deficit (or surplus) is still relatively small compared to total trade between the two countries ― between 1 and 2 percent.” And trade deficits aren’t even necessarily a bad thing.  This is hardly the first time Trump has been criticized for misinformation. While he often cites incorrect or misleading information with unflinching confidence, Wednesday’s comments add confusion to already complicated trade talks. Trump, who has long complained about trade imbalances, recently decided to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Canada and Mexico were exempted from the tariffs, with the caveat that the ongoing talks on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement result in a deal that satisfies Trump. Trump’s admission of cluelessness could make it harder for NAFTA negotiators to take him at his word. Then again, it might not come as much of a surprise.    I\\'m pretty sure that Justin Trudeau & every other world leader knows Trump is a bullshit artist. It\\'s baked into the cake by now.— Jeet Heer (@HeerJeet) March 15, 2018       POOL New / Reuters      WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says he thinks it’s great that China’s president now holds that office for life and muses that maybe the U.S. will do the same someday. Trump’s remarks were met with laughter and applause during a luncheon for Republican donors Saturday at his South Florida estate. CNN said it obtained a recording of the remarks. Chinese President Xi Jinping recently consolidated power. Trump told the gathering: “He’s now president for life. President for life. And he’s great.” Trump added, “I think it’s great. Maybe we’ll give that a shot someday.” Trump criticized his Democratic presidential opponent Hillary Clinton, repeated his view about “a rigged system,” and called the Iraq invasion “the single worst decision ever made.” He referred to former President George W. Bush as “another real genius.”      In remarks delivered at a private fundraising event and obtained by The Atlantic, the president attributed Conor Lamb’s success to the fact that he “sounds like a Republican.”      Kevin Lamarque / Reuters      If Donald Trump is worried about Democrats using an upset victory in Pennsylvania as a blueprint for winning big in the midterms, he didn’t let on. Trump broke his silence on the election at a private fundraiser for Missouri Senate candidate Josh Hawley Wednesday night, telling a crowd of donors that Lamb had run “a pretty smart race, actually,” according to an audio recording of the remarks obtained by The Atlantic. Democrat Conor Lamb defeated Republican Rick Saccone in a district Trump won by nearly 20 points in 2016. “The young man last night that ran, he said, ‘Oh, I’m like Trump. Second Amendment, everything. I love the tax cuts, everything.’ He ran on that basis,” Trump said. “He ran on a campaign that said very nice things about me. I said, ‘Is he a Republican? He sounds like a Republican to me.’”  Recommended Reading          Later on, he stressed Lamb’s appeal to many blue-collar conservatives, saying, “But I guess when you’re running in a certain area, that’s probably a good tactic.” Trump had been unusually silent about the race on Wednesday, a departure from past elections Republicans have lost during his time as president. After Republican Ed Gillespie lost his gubernatorial bid in Virginia to Ralph Northam, a Democrat, Trump was quick to claim that Gillespie “did not embrace me or what I stand for.” And when Republican Roy Moore lost to a Democrat, Doug Jones, in a controversial Alabama Senate race, he said he “originally” knew that Moore would “not be able to win the general election.” Yet the day after Saccone lost by a razor-thin margin against Lamb, a square-jawed Marine veteran who was careful not to make anti-Trumpism the central tenet of his campaign, Trump’s Twitter feed was empty of any mentions of the race. The president did return to one familiar self-congratulatory mode: He argued at the Hawley fundraiser that his last-minute rally for Saccone on Saturday in Moon Township had been an overall success, saying that it boosted the candidate’s vote total. “We had an interesting time because we lifted [Saccone] seven points up. That’s a lot,” Trump said. “And I was up 22 points, and we lifted seven, and seven normally would be enough, but we’ll see how it all comes out. It’s, like, virtually a tie.” (It was not exactly clear what Trump was basing his conclusion of a seven-point boost on.)  Never miss a story. Start your free trial. Uncompromising quality.

President Donald Trump said Monday that he would have charged into a Florida school during the shooting there earlier this month even if he were unarmed. \"I really believe I’d run in there even if I didn’t have a weapon,\" Trump told governors meeting at the White House to discuss school safety.     Trump slammed as \"frankly, disgusting\" the armed school guard who remained outside the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland that left 17 students and teachers dead. The president also criticized several deputies who failed to immediately enter the school, telling the governors that the law enforcement officers \"weren’t exactly Medal of Honor winners.\" \"The way they performed was really a disgrace,\" he said. Trump also said that armed sheriff\\'s deputy Scot Peterson, who was on site during the mass shooting there but did not enter, had \"choked.\" Peterson, who resigned last week after being suspended without pay, pushed back against a wave of criticism for his actions in a Monday statement from his attorney. President Trump on Monday also defended his proposal that some teachers in schools be armed and trained in the use of firearms, saying he only wanted \"highly trained people that have a natural talent [for shooting], like hitting a baseball, or hitting a golf ball, or putting\" to handle weapons in schools. The president compared the skill involved in handling firearms to that required for the game of golf, where \"some people always make the 4-footer, and some people under pressure can’t even take their club back.\" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, was critical of the president\\'s proposal, telling him Monday that \"we need a little less Tweeting, a little more listening\" on school shooting solutions, adding later on MSNBC that he wanted the president to \"just tweet a little less and listen a little more here to the educators of America who want to educate and not carry firearms into their schools.\"     On Monday, Trump told assembled governors the only way to stop school shootings was \"retribution,\" adding, \"You\\'re not going to stop it by being kind.\" And he vowed again to take action to ban rapid-fire bump stock devices without Congress and called for state lawmakers to reopen institutions to house the mentally ill. He also said he had had lunch with NRA leaders Wayne LaPierre and Chris Cox over the weekend, claiming the gun advocates \"want to do something.\" In a break from his steadfast allegiance to the group in the past, Trump even told the governors that it was fine to \"fight them every once in a while.\" \"Don’t worry about the NRA, they\\'re on our side,\" Trump said. \"Half of you are so afraid of the NRA, there\\'s nothing to be afraid of.\" \"And you know what, if they\\'re not with you, we have to fight them every once in a while. That’s OK,\" he added. \"They\\'re doing what they think is right. ... But sometimes we’re going to have to be very tough and we\\'re going to have to fight them.\"  US President Donald Trump speaks during the 2018 White House business session with state governors in the State dining Room of the White House on February 26, 2018 in Washington, DC.Mandel Ngan / AFP - Getty Images  In the weeks since the horrific school shooting, Trump has proposed combating such incidents by training and arming some teachers with guns. Last week, he suggested that firearm-adept school staff be given \"a little bit of a bonus\" for carrying weapons, and promised federal funds to train them. The White House has said Trump supports bipartisan legislation from Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Chris Murphy, D-Conn., that would make the current national background check system function more effectively, though it wouldn\\'t expand the system\\'s reach. On Monday, the president reiterated that he wanted to ban bump stocks. \"By the way, bump stocks, we’re writing that out. I\\'m writing that out myself, I don\\'t care if Congress does it or not, I\\'m writing it out myself, OK? You put it into the machine-gun category, which is what it is, it becomes essentially a machine gun.\" In addition, Trump on Monday called for greater institutionalization of mentally ill people who were believed to be capable of violence. “We’re going to have to start talking about mental institutions, because a lot of folks in this room closed their mental institutions also, so we have no halfway,\" he said. \"We have nothing between a prison and leaving him at his house, which we can’t do anymore. So I think you folks have to start thinking about that.” “You used to be able to bring them into a mental institution, and hopefully he gets help or whatever, but he’s off the streets. You can’t arrest him, I guess, because he hasn’t done anything, but you know he’s like a boiler ready to explode, right?” he added. “In the old days you’d put him into a mental institution, and we had them in New York and our government started closing them because of cost.” Trump has also directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to propose regulations that would ban the use of bump stocks and similar devices \"that turn legal weapons into machine guns.\" Trump, meanwhile, also addressed trade issues during the meeting. \"Canada is very smooth,\" he said, America’s northern neighbor has the better end of trade deals that are \"wonderful for them\" and \"not wonderful for” the United States. Later Monday, the White House was asked whether Trump\\'s comment that he would have run into the school during the shooting was intended to indicate that he could have saved the day, and whether the president had the training that would be required to use a firearm in that situation. “I think he was just stating that as a leader he would have stepped in, and hopefully been able to help,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a press briefing, pointing to the fact that \"a lot of the individuals that helped protect others that day weren\\'t carrying firearms,\" and adding that in that sort of situation, the president would want to take \"courageous action.\" Sanders also said Trump \"would support a legislative solution\" to ban bump stocks \"if we cannot find an administrative fix,\" and reiterated Trump\\'s support of Cornyn\\'s bill.    Before the wall, before “Crooked Hillary,” before “I alone can fix it,” what many Americans knew about Donald Trump was summed up in one blunt catchphrase: “You’re fired.”  Trump’s signature line from his NBC reality show, “The Apprentice,” was, in quintessential Trump style, improvised. He blurted it out during the taping of his first show, and the crew instantly knew they had a winner.  Now, Trump is again being viewed as a leader given to frequent, dramatic sackings, this time with far more than ratings at stake. From national security adviser Michael Flynn’s departure less than a month into the new administration to this week’s firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the parade of departures has become a different kind of prime-time drama, raising questions about whether Trump is draining the swamp or creating dangerous instability. Although the number of departures is unusual, the biggest change in how Washington operates is the way in which Trump has gone about swapping out personnel.  Tillerson learned that he was being fired via a presidential tweet. FBI Director James B. Comey found out he was sacked last year by seeing a headline on cable news. Last summer, chief of staff Reince Priebus’s White House career ended when other top officials hopped out of the black Suburban SUV that was carrying them from Air Force One back to Washington, leaving Priebus the lone passenger in a vehicle that then peeled out of the president’s motorcade. In these and many other cases over the first 14 months of Trump’s administration, there was no “You’re fired” moment, at least not from the president. Presidents often outsource the unseemly business of firing people to their chief of staff, but “what’s really unusual about this president is the public humiliations,” said Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, who studies presidential transitions at the Brookings Institution. “I’ve never seen a president criticize his staff so publicly and individually.” The high-velocity spin on the White House’s revolving door stems in part from “an insurgent campaign that shunned experience” and in part from the president’s tendency to “value loyalty over qualifications,” Tenpas said. She has calculated that first-year staff turnover in the Trump White House is more than triple that of Barack Obama’s administration and double that of Ronald Reagan’s. Trump’s approach to management may be new to the White House, but it’s not surprising to those who have worked for him for decades. Longtime executives in Trump’s business empire say that although he successfully constructed a popular conception of himself as a tough, blunt truth-teller, the “You’re fired” image was always a caricature. On “The Apprentice,” the decisions about which contestant to jettison came not from the mercurial chief executive at the big, gleaming desk, but from the program’s producers, according to people who worked on the show. Trump got his instructions on whom to sack via a prompter on his desk that was made to look like a phone. And in real life, in more than four decades at the helm of his family business, Trump did sometimes made a show of taking charge by dispatching underlings in public, humiliating fashion. But those were the exceptions. At the Trump Organization, he didn’t fire many people and, when he did, he only rarely took the action himself, generally leaving the dirty work to his deputies. Trump has frequently explained the turnover in his operations by saying that he thrives on chaos and controversy. He has been quick to criticize or humiliate members of his administration in public — he peppered Tillerson with disdainful tweets and leaks, just as he had with Comey, Priebus and Jeff Sessions, who remains in the role of attorney general.  Yet some of those who have been subjected to harsh public critiques stay on in their jobs. And many of those who have left nonetheless remain loyal to Trump both publicly and privately — a pattern that has continued throughout his career, as fired staffers come back to work for him years later. “Some people just haven’t synced well with him, but they still support his goals and philosophies,” said Sean Spicer, Trump’s first press secretary, who quit after six months in the position. “I approached my job in a very traditional way, as Rex did. And the president is a very untraditional disrupter. But even after you’re gone, he’s very helpful and looks after people who’ve been part of the team.” Tenpas’s study of turnover in the Trump White House concluded that the staff volatility is so high in part because the president disdained people with government experience and was unwilling to hire people who had opposed him during the campaign. Trump promised a break with business as usual, a governmentwide housecleaning that would entail plenty of departures. But his time in the White House has been notable for the number of sackings from within his own roster of appointments. Many of those who have left or been pushed out departed not because of policy differences, but because Trump did not connect with them or did not trust them. “There’ll always be some degree of turnover because that’s who he is,” Spicer said. “But it will be less over time because he’s really starting to get a handle on the type of people he needs to push his agenda.” Like the contestants on “The Apprentice,” many of those who have suffered embarrassing endings to their short tenures over the past year had the great disadvantage of not having spent much time around their boss before this job. They therefore lacked the skills honed by executives who worked for Trump for decades. Most of his inner circle in the Trump Organization had, contrary to popular impressions of the president, devoted most of their working careers to what was often portrayed to the public as a virtual one-man show. Those who stayed with Trump say they learned how to let him vent when he was angry. They knew how to appeal to his delight in appearing to be unpredictable. They knew not to challenge him in public but rather to master the art of hanging out in his office long enough to subtly make their case and, most crucially, get him to believe that some alternative to his stated view was also his idea.  “At some point, you have to understand your boss,” Spicer said. “You either cut against the grain or you understand how he operates.” Those who have enjoyed long tenures with Trump say they learned early on that if they could balance his craving for respect and loyalty against his desire to project strength, they could sometimes get their way. “The funny thing was that if you played him right, you could often win,” said Barbara Res, who ran Trump’s construction operations in the 1980s. “He needed to be stroked all the time and told how smart he was. Every decision process was clouded by his sense that he knows more than anybody else. But you could work with that: The way we got things done was to approach him with an idea and make him think it was his. It was so easy.” While he built his reputation as a savvy dealmaker who relished conflict, Trump has rarely tolerated open dissent. Rather, he tells his executives that he expects them to rally around and defend him against reactions stirred up by his various provocations. From his stunning dismissal of Comey last May through the flurry of recent firings, Trump has sought to define his brand as leadership that moves swiftly and unilaterally, embracing controversy because it’s a surefire way to dominate the news. He has called himself a “ratings machine,” and he has always rewarded those who enhanced that role and punished those who sought to share the limelight. Since the 1970s, Trump has been quick to push out people who spoke out against him, contradicted him in public, claimed credit for something his company had achieved or behaved in ways he considered disloyal. The hierarchical structure of the federal bureaucracy was never going to be a comfortable place for Trump. Before taking office, Trump told a group of visiting Silicon Valley executives that it would be simple to work with him: “You’ll call my people, you’ll call me,” he said. “It doesn’t make any difference. We have no formal chain of command here.” But once he got to Washington, Trump found himself without close aides who knew when to yield to him and how to push him without sending him over the edge. And as his presidency has faced pressure from low popularity ratings, dangers around the world and a constant drumbeat of investigation into allegations of wrongdoing by his campaign, he has gotten rid of or threatened people for failing to embrace his policies, embarrassing him, or being what he considered weak or insufficiently supportive. “I listen to people,” Trump wrote in one of his books, “Think Like a Billionaire,” “but my vision is my vision.”  \\n President Donald Trump bragged about lying to the Canadian prime minister, argued a Democrat who just won a special election was just like him and tried to sell his trade policies to a group of Republican donors Wednesday. Speaking behind closed doors at a fundraiser for Attorney General Josh Hawley, who is running for the Republican Senate nomination, Trump said that he told Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the U.S. has a trade deficit with Canada, then conceded that he did not know if that was true, according to audio obtained by TIME. (It is not.) He also weighed in on the recent special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, claiming that Democratic candidate Conor Lamb is essentially a conservative. “He ran on a campaign that said very nice things about me,” Trump said of Lamb. “I was saying ‘is he a Republican?’ It sounds like a Republican to me. But I guess when you’re popular in a certain area that’s probably a good tactic.” Read the full transcript of Trump’s speech from Hawley’s fundraiser below: \\n \\n We have a lot of friends in this area and I just stopped at a little place called Boeing. We just looked at the new plans without pilots now, we have a situation so important here [INAUDIBLE] … they had a very big success, a $2 billion success. That’s a big success. It’s a testament to a wonderful guy whose running who knows what it’s all about. He’s someone that can win, he’s leading in the polls, just about all the polls I’ve seen. There’s one that is a little bit down, and that’s the one you have to run on, because you always have to run a little bit scared, right? A little bit scared. I saw fortunately the following [INAUDIBLE, LAUGHTER]. But you’re doing good, I’ll tell you. Every one of them. You’re the one that can do it. And the whole world is watching, really. We have to change things. We need the votes. We need those votes. You’re working on the phone [INAUDIBLE] but once you get in there, right I know that. Wouldn’t that be nice if we had 51 instead of 60? Wouldn’t it be nice? Someday, someone is going to explain that to me. What’s going on here?\\n Some of the senators that have been there really for a long time are just dead set on that. But we’re gonna get, we have a chance to win a number of seats and I think we have a really good chance to win a large number of seats. So we’ll see what happens. Mr. Ashcroft, where is Mr. Ashcroft, I didn’t see him. I met his son by the way. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]. Your son is damn good by the way. [Cheers and applause, inaudible conversation]. \\n I met John’s son, he said where is your father? He’s up speaking. I said [inaudible]. Terrific man, terrific family. But we have a chance to do something that is going to be very important. And it starts right here. It starts right here. And I guess last night, I don’t know, I guess the final results aren’t quite in, but we had an interesting time because we lifted seven points up. That’s a lot. I was up 22 points. And we lifted seven. And seven normally would be enough. But we’ll see how it all comes out. It’s virtually a tie. Where is our great Ronna, is she here? Ronna? Ronna McDaniel, whose done — who won Michigan for me, and we won the state of Michigan, first time since Reagan. [Applause]. Anybody that wins Michigan … and I think by some 200,000 odd votes, it was 400 and something. Four-hundred something votes. And I don’t know whats gonna happen and I know he came up a lot in the last few days. We went there, with a speech, the place was packed. It’s actually interesting because it’s only a Congressman for 5 months. I don’t know about that one, Josh. It was a lot of work for five months. They’re redistricting. But we’ll see what happens. But I told Josh just a little while ago, I’m coming back here just before the race and we’ll get a bigger, we’ll get a big something … [APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER] The country’s watching. This is one of the most important races because this is one we can win because of Josh. We had to get Josh to do it. Once that was over that was a big thing. Because you do need the right candidate. And we have a few of them. We have a few pretty good ones. You know about whats happening. A couple of other guys joined and they’re gonna have, I think great success. So we look forward to it.\\n One of the things that Josh actually mentioned that I think is probably underscored, understated, is judges. We are going to be appointing 145. They came in 140. You know, my whole life I’ve helped a few people become a federal judge, not gotten it for them but I helped. And they never forget. It’s a big deal. A federal judge — so I come in, there’s this whole pile of paper on my desk, these are federal judges, these are applications. I said how many do we appoint? 145. I said 145? Because for two years, two and a half years in Congress none were appointed by President Obama. So I said thank you President Obama. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]. \\n We have 17 court of appeals judges. We have one Supreme Court judge who has done a fantastic job, Justice Gorsuch. We will see what happens on that score. But we have 145 judges and 17 Court of Appeals judges and we have appointed, I guess we’ve had almost 30 approved already. And what a difference that’s making. That will be almost half the judiciary, will be appointed by us. We’re thinking. [APPLAUSE]. Thats something. I mentioned before, we have to run on the tax cuts because that has become the most popular thing. Everybody’s happy. The companies like it like crazy. You know, the companies, we didn’t expect, when we did tax cuts and you know they called it tax reform. I said do me a favor don’t call it tax reform. It hasn’t worked in 45 years. Tax reform. People say, are you going to raise my taxes? They’re reforming taxes. I said that means taxes can go up. They said oh well no, it’s always called tax reform. I said let’s call it tax cuts. They said what would you like to call it? Call it tax cut cut cut plan. Which I did, I actually did, but they thought it sounded a little hokey so we called it the tax cut and job plan. I like the first one better. \\n But we have no Democrat votes. Claire McCaskill was against it, because she’s party line. Not that she was against it. She’s party line. She’s gonna go with party line. Like the young man last night that run. He said, oh I’m like Trump. Second Amendment, everything. I love the tax cuts, everything. You look at him now. It’s a pretty smart race, actually. But he ran, and he ran on that basis. And the bottom line is when he votes he’s gonna vote with Nancy Pelosi. He’s gonna vote with Pelosi and he’s gonna vote with Schumer and that’s what’s gonna happen. And there is nothing he can do about it. He’s not gonna go and vote with Republicans so it doesn’t matter what he feels. It doesn’t matter Claire McCaskill has voted against everything that we want. Voted against everything that you stand for. And voted against these massive tax cuts that are bringing wealth back into families and bringing wealth into the state of Missouri. And she voted against. Because this wasn’t principle, this was the fact that she was told to vote that way. And she has to vote that way. And if she didn’t vote that way the party would drop her very easily and wouldn’t be around and wouldn’t be spending lots of money on her and that’s the way it is. So she voted against tax cuts, and I believe that anyone that voted against that bill will be very hard to win an election. When you campaign and when you’re out there Josh, you should just keep bringing it up. I read an article and I thought it was very nice actually. She’s not gonna say bad things about President Trump. I must be very popular in this state. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE].\\n Last night, the young man, also. He ran on a campaign that said very nice things about me. I was saying ‘Is he a Republican?’ It sounds like a Republican to me. But I guess when you’re popular in a certain area that’s probably a good tactic. \\n But we’re not gonna get her vote. So you have to defeat her. You have to defeat her. And if you don’t it’s going to be trouble. I mean they could actually take away the taxes. They could take away the Second Amendment. Very important, the judges. They could stop putting the judges that we’ve been having poured onto the court over the last eight years, you can’t take it. I mean, you just can’t have it. You see some of the decisions. How about the 9th circuit? How do you know, they always file in the 9th circuit and that’s not right. They’re gonna file in the 9th circuit and they win win win and then they lose hopefully in the Supreme Court and hopefully they will but it’s a very important thing. It shows you how important it is to have fair people put on the bench. So the judges are so important, just so important.\\n We’re doing a lot of things, companies are moving back into the country. You have Chrysler that’s coming back from Mexico, you ever hear that one? It’s always leaving for Mexico, someone’s leaving for Mexico, someone’s leaving for Mexico and now you have many many companies coming back in. You have steel mills opening up, which hasn’t happened in 30 years. And the tariffs are just a form of life you just can’t keep doing this to the outside world. And some of our worst abusers in terms of what they do on trade are our so-called friends. You look at some of these countries that are our friends and you look at the trade deficits we have and it’s staggering. So thats just phase 1, but it’s a little phase. But we have to get back the respect. You know we built ourselves as a great power, a great manufacturing power and you look how so many jobs were taken. I mean NAFTA has been a disaster for this country. I know it affected [INAUDIBLE] but you go off to New England. They’re still paying the price of losing all of those jobs. And those are real jobs. Those are real, credible, powerful important jobs. Even for defense. We have to build our steel. We have to be able to have aluminum. We’re at a point where we could lose all our steel factories, our steel factories, our steel mills, our plants. And we can’t let that happen. People said oh you know we will get our steel from China. Oh good, let’s see if we have to have a national emergency we’re gonna get our steel from China. It’s incredible.\\n  I’ve been using the expression if you have steel you don’t have a country. This isn’t like we’re making pencils. [SLIGHT LAUGHTER]. This is big stuff. Since I’ve announced this we’ve had numerous openings from plants and some are open or expanded right here, and people are starting to see it a little bit differently. We have to do what’s called reciprocal tax. We have countries that charge us 25 percent to get a car in they don’t take the car anyway. Just so you know, they have non-dollar barriers. Ok they’re non-dollar. You know what the dollar is? You can’t sell in our country. That’s worse than heavy taxes. We have countries, or groups of countries, which is even worse. The European Union is very tough. You know, we have the European Union. A lot of you came from Europe, right? And guess what they’re pretty smart. And they formed a group, and they make it very difficult they are very difficult traders. They have these barrier where you can’t keep your product in no matter what you do. If you do get your product in you pay dearly. China is the biggest producer there’s no question about it. So last year with China we lost $500 billion not million, $500 billion it’s a lot. $500 billion and it’s been that way for years. From $200 to $504 billion every year. We rebuilt China, we actually did. Take that money away from China, I mean, we rebuilt it. And it all started with the World Trade Organization. If you look at China it’s like this for many many centuries, world trade is like a rocket ship and much of it came right out of this country. We can’t stop it.\\n \\n \\n  Read More:   President Trump Pitched Tariffs to Republican Donors. He Was Met With Silence   \\n \\n I’m very friendly with the President, he’s a great guy. We have great chemistry, a great relationship but he’s for China and I’m for the good old USA. [CHEERS]\\n As an example, they send a car to us, we charge them a 2 percent tax. We send a car to them, they charge us a 25 percent tax. Somehow that doesn’t work too well. [LAUGHTER]. That’s not a great formula. But 25 most of the time you can’t get it [INAUDIBLE]. Even Japan, look, the prime minister is a great guy, Abe. He’s a warrior. Tough strong, smart. But I said, the trade isn’t so good with Japan. It’s so one-sided. They don’t take our product, we take their cars. The cars are 90 percent … they cars, they just go they need Mario Andretti to drive those cars off the boats. They come off the boats like 16 times [INAUDIBLE, LAUGHTER]. We send a car in Japan, they analyze it for four weeks before they decide to send it back becaue it is not environmentally friendly. It’s unbelievable. It’s actually, one of the drug companies actually had a car made and it was the most environmentally perfect car and it cost them a fortune. They spent a fortune. And they had everything the highest quality you can have. Everything was far better than any car they’ve ever sent to us. They spent three or four hundreds thousand dollars on a car that would sell for like $35,000, right? Not a good deal. But they wanted to see if they could get it in. They’re going crazy. Four days went by, then five days and we’re ready to approach them and they said no no we have to do one more test. It’s called the bowling ball test, do you know what that is? That’s where they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and drop it in the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, the car doesn’t qualify. Guess what, the hood dented a little bit and they say this car doesn’t qualify. It’s horrible. It’s horrible. It’s horrible. And then you hear about the free traders. ‘Cause I’m a free trader. But I’m like, I want to be a smart trader, I want to be a fair trader. It’s so unfair what’s happening to our country. And I don’t know the politicians have lost their way. In some cases like South Korea they’re making a fortune. We backed them many years ago. But when they became rich we never changed the deal. So we were backing backing backing and no politician ever changed the deal. Now we have a very big trade deficit with them and we protect them. \\n So we lose money in trade and we lose money in the military. We have right now 32,000 soldiers on the border between North and South Korea. Lets see what happens. We sort of did a good job with that one. Lets see what happens. People said all of this rhetoric is terrible. The rhetoric for the last 30 years hasn’t been so good. It was called appeasement. Please don’t do anything. Obama, let’s not talk about that. Meanwhile Kim Jong Un is making nuclear weapons. He had a test about a year ago and it registered as an 8.6 and you never heard of that on the richter scale. And they said man it was an earthquake, 8.6, someplace in Asia. Where was it, oh it was in North Korea. It was a nuclear test. And it shifted a mountain. This is a real mountain. This is not some 10-foot deal. It actually shifted, that was the power. They’re all saying his rhetoric is terrible, it’s so tough, little Rocket Man. It’s so terrible, the way … and he’s gonna get us into a war. Well you know what is gonna get us into a war is weakness. [APPLAUSE] We put massive sanctions on North Korea. Massive. Like nobody’s ever been sanctioned. And in all fairness, China has really helped at the border. It could help more, but they’ve done more for us than they’ve ever done for any President. \\n So here’s the funny part. Everyone’s saying, “‘oh, he’s gonna get us in trouble.” Then three weeks later you hear, we’d love to go to the Olympics and participate. Everyone goes “What? Where did that come?” So they participate in the Olympics. And then the delegation comes over from South Korea and they just left North Korea and they said Mr. President, Kim Jong Un would love to meet with you and he will not do any testing and he will not do any missile watches and he would love to meet with you. So I said really wow that’s good. [INAUDIBLE]. They go out to the press and the press is there and you never saw so many reporters. Because they heard it was a big announcement on North Korea. So the worst, like CNN fake news. Erin Burnett says “This will make him a great President.” [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] She actually said, this could make him a great President. Even the worst of them, for two hours, three hours, they couldn’t believe, they’re looking at each other, they couldn’t believe, they said where did this come from? After 25-30 years where did this come from? And then it happened. A day later. “Obama could have done that too.” Obama could not have done that. [Crowd: “NO WAY”]. It’s really sad. It was almost, you have to smile, because it’s so out of control. But what I heard — I woke up the next morning and I said finally I’m getting stuff. \\n I’ve done a lot of things. Taxes, a lot of stuff. Our military is stronger now and we just got $700 billion and we have to build it because it’s totally depleted. We don’t have our military we’re not gonna be here [APPLAUSE]. We’ll be walking into the doors. [INAUDIBLE]. We’ll make the greatest equipment in the world, right down the street with Boeing. Other places. It’s jobs. But we have no choice, But when i heard that, I wake up, I just heard the greatest statements from MSNBC, from CNN, from all the haters they couldn’t believe it. Reporters, professionals the ones you see hating all the time. I said this is the most incredible thing, we’ve never seen this. But by the time we woke up the next morning they had a new line. Anybody could have done that. Obama could have met. Bush could have met. Bush friends are here but Bush [INAUDIBLE AND LAUGHTER]. But they couldn’t have met. Because nobody would have done what I did to set the plan. And they are suffering. I don’t want them to suffer. But they’re suffering. Lack of food, lack of everything. Nobody would have done that. So you see the narrative changes. Now they are saying will take at least two months to be able to negotiate. So these are the people. They say it will take two months to be able to negotiate. He shouldn’t go there. And the greatest line is President Trump has agreed to meet. These are people that said I can’t believe it. Unbelievable This is great news. This is the biggest thing that has happened in forty years. The next day. President Trump has conceded a meeting with Kim Jong Un. Because has done that he has already given them a victory because he’s a great debater. I mean if media [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]\\n The greatest is when you’re watching them and these are the people that are so afraid that it was all gonna be [INAUDIBLE] and they say it was incredible and then their [INAUDIBLE] told them what to say. They say, maybe he’s not the one to negotiate. He’s got very little knowledge of the Korean peninsula and maybe he’s not the one. Maybe we should send in the people that have been playing games and didn’t know what the hell they’re doing for 25 years. APPLAUSE. You’ll be fine. … [INAUDIBLE] It’s a beautiful young, a beautiful couple, and everyone thinks he’s a star and he is a star and I don’t know how the press treats you. [LAUGHTER, INAUDIBLE] \\n It was somewhat of a miracle, it’s far ahead of schedule. And then you hear that you know, we’re making a major concession by agreeing to the meeting. It’s the craziest thing. But go back a couple weeks earlier and listen to the [INAUDIBLE]. \\n So we’re always a little bit of a disadvantage because of the media. You have it here, I know you have it here too. But the advantage we have is our people are really smart. They did it. When I did the tariffs, and what I’m really saying is it’s not so much tariffs, it’s really saying we can’t be taken advantage of anymore by these people that come in and dump everything in our country and destroy our mills and destroy our workers and destroy everything. When I did the tariffs,m ost people understand what I’m doing is fighting for them. I’m fighting for these companies that are being abandoned, and the jobs that have been abandoned. And that’s why we have a lot of companies moving back in. When you see happening and we look we’re renegotiating NAFTA right now. I don’t know that we can make a deal. I tell people openly. The best deal is to terminate it and then make a new deal. But I don’t know that we can make a deal because Mexico is so spoiled from this horrible deal. From our standpoint, horrible, from their standpoint. So think of it — Mexico makes more than $100 billion a year on the United States. How stupid is this? But you know sometimes something is so good but how do you negotiate? The best way, terminate. Let’s start all over again. Let’s start all over again. Some of the politicians are afraid to terminate, oh we don’t want to terminate NAFTA. Take a look at these empty mills all over the place that they turn into nursing homes, [INAUDIBLE] walls on the outside. But it’s it just can’t be. I really think we’re making the point, a lot of people are digging it, I will tell you the people that really count which is you, the workers, everybody, they’re really understanding what’s going on. Nobody’s done what I’m doing, it’s sort of really virgin territory. It’s absolutely virgin territory. It’s territory that, our country for 50 or 60 or 70 years has not wanted to go there. They just haven’t for whatever reason. And our wealth has been taken. Our jobs have been taken. Our companies have moved and now they’re starting to move back. So it’s a formula that it is absolute there’s disruption, there’s anger. And just remember our friends, that everyone says, our friends, our allies. I know our allies, but our allies care about themselves. They don’t care about us. You look at our trade deficits with these countries that are our allies. It’s unbelievable. And they understand it. I don’t blame them. I told Japan so we would lose $100 million a year with Japan. $100 million. So why are we taxing their cars when they come in? We would lose nothing. We might even make something. And you know what they’re gonna do? They’re gonna say, well we don’t want to pay that tax, so lets build plants in the United States. They already have some. But they’ll expand them and they’ll build [INAUDIBLE]. Because they don’t want to pay the tax. And I want them to pay the taxes. I want them to build new plants in the United States. Let them make United States cars.\\n Like China makes them…[INAUDIBLE] We have a company. They want to build planes, Boeing is being forced to build plants. I don’t like that. I don’t like it. And I’m not saying China’s wrong. When I was with President Xi I was with a big group of people and I was saying how China is ripping off the United States. And he was like woo, this is so uncomfortable. [LAUGHTER]. 700 press. I’m saying China is ripping off … but I don’t blame you. I said it’s great you were able to do it for yourselves. I blame the people that represented our country. Because they were not doing their jobs they were delinquent in allowing this to happen to us. So we owe $21 trillion, we lose $800 billion a year. Josh will say I don’t think I’m gonna run. [LAUGHTER, INAUDIBLE]. He might say, forget about it I’m gonna run. Think of it Josh. We lose $800 billion a year on trade. Who made these deals? Who made these deals? Then you have certain people that think it’s ok to lose $800. You know, these worldly people. You know why they’re worldly people because they have stuff on the other side. [LAUGHTER, INAUDIBLE] There can’t be another reason. But we lose $800 billion a year on trade. We lose our jobs we lose everything and it’s not happening anymore because it’s starting to come back. \\n But over the next few months you are going to find it even much more interesting. Because things are really, you know we have such an [INAUDIBLE] you have to do this this this, wait 90 days, wait 6 months, you can’t do it, you’re not allowed to legally. We have agreements that are so bad, we don’t want an agreement with the trade. [INAUDIBLE]. I said does that agreement terminate it’s terrible. Sir. There is no termination. I said what do you mean? We don’t have the right to term — I said, look. OK. 10 years, 20 years. No sir. There is no right. I said what the hell, you know what I do, I just terminate it [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]\\n [INAUDIBLE.]\\n We’ll call it unconstitutional, these deals are so one-sided. I’ll give another example, Mexico. I have this great deal. The day it was signed it was a bad deal. Because they have a 16 percent VAT tax. And we don’t. So they were already up 16% before the deal and nobody saw that. And by the time they realized it, the deal was done. But instead of adjusting the deal, what was it, thirty years ago, when it was first signed. Instead of adjusting the deal, we lived with it. What the hell difference does it make? So they have a 16% step up [INAUDIBLE] and they have for many years. And Mexico and Canada. And by the way, Canada? They negotiate tougher than Mexico. Trudeau came to see me, he’s a good man, he said we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please. Nice guy, good looking guy. Comes in. Donald we have no trade deficit. He’s very tough. Everyone else, getting killed or whatever. But he’s tough. I said, well Justin, you do. I didn’t even know. Josh, I had no idea. I just said you’re wrong. You’re wrong. It was so stupid. [LAUGHTER]. I thought it was fine. I said, you’re wrong Justin. He said, nope we have no trade deficit. I said, well in that case I feel differently. I said but I don’t believe it. I sent one of our guys out. His guy, my guy. They said check because I can’t believe it. Well, sir you’re actually right, we have no deficit but that doesn’t include energy and timber. [LAUGHTER]. Well you don’t have timber, and when you do we’ll lost $17 billion. It’s incredible.\\n \\n \\n  Read More:   President Trump Claims the U.S. Has a Trade Deficit With Canada. That’s Not So Clear   \\n \\n So you’re in good hands. And I know Josh [APPLAUSE]. Claire McCaskill is a guaranteed negative vote on every single thing that you people stand for, and frankly the vast majority of the people of Missouri stand for. It is a negative vote for our country and you have to defeat it. Claire McCaskill, last time she got really lucky, she got lucky, she was going to lose. That was a done deal. And then something happened. I was watching. I said oh yeah, what happened? That was big. I said yeah, I was right. [INAUDIBLE]. So you gotta get her out. Bad for Missouri. Bad for the country.

That\\'s it,\" Trump told the crowd. At a Pennsylvania rally for U.S. House candidate Rick Saccone—who is expected to lose to Democrat Conor Lamb—Trump hailed Asian countries such as China and Singapore for meting out the death penalty to drugs dealers. He told the crowd, \"It\\'s a discussion we have to start thinking about. I don\\'t know if this country\\'s ready for it.\"    \\nPresident Donald Trump delivers remarks at the Make America Great Again Rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, on March 10.\\nGetty Images\\n  \"Do you think the drug dealers who kill thousands of people during their lifetime, do you think they care who\\'s on a blue-ribbon committee?\" Trump asked. \"The only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness. When you catch a drug dealer, you\\'ve got to put him away for a long time.\" Trump recently came out in support of executing drug dealers, suggesting that the punishment could help tackle the opioid crisis. More than 64,000 people were killed by opioids in 2016. On Saturday, Trump promised that his administration would roll out unspecified \"tougher\" policies on opioids, and was reportedly met with cheers from the crowd of supporters.   The Washington Post reported earlier Saturday that officials at the Domestic Policy Council and the Department of Justice were looking into introducing legislation allowing prosecutors to seek the death penalty for dealers. The White House said that Trump had expressed interest in Singapore\\'s policy of executing drug dealers. \"Some countries have a very tough penalty, the ultimate penalty, and they have much less of a drug problem than we do,\" Trump said during an appearance at a White House summit on opioids last week. Singapore officials have reportedly briefed White House officials on their country\\'s drugs offense punishment laws. Trump previously expressed admiration for Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte\\'s controversial crackdown on drugs dealers, which, human rights groups said, led to thousands of extrajudicial killings by security services and police. Shortly after taking office, Trump reportedly praised Duterte in a phone call for doing an \"unbelievable job on the drug problem.\" Trump, in a recent, humorous speech, praised a proposed Chinese Communist Party measure abolishing the two-presidential-term limit, suggesting a similar measure could be introduced in the U.S. \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nDonald Trump and Justin Trudeau\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nDonald Trump and Justin Trudeau\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t \\n\\t \\n\\t Sign if you agree\\n\\t   Dear World, we recognize what a monumental embarrassment Donald Trump is \\n\\t \\n\\t \\n\\t Sign if you agree\\n\\t \\n\\t \\n\\t \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n First Name \\n\\n\\n Last Name \\n\\n\\n Email *\\n\\n\\n Zip/Postal Code *  \\n SMS phone number\\n \\n \\n comments \\n \\n \\n Not in US?\\n \\n United States\\n \\n \\n \\n  Jim Watson, AFP Getty Images By signing this petition you will receive periodic updates on offers and activism opportunities from Daily Kos.

He’s a good guy, Justin. He said, ‘No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,’ ” Trump said, mimicking Trudeau, according to audio of the private event in Missouri obtained by The Washington Post. “Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in — ‘Donald, we have no trade deficit.’ He’s very proud because everybody else, you know, we’re getting killed.\\n“ ... So, he’s proud. I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid. … And I thought they were smart. I said, ‘You’re wrong, Justin.’ He said, ‘Nope, we have no trade deficit.’ I said, ‘Well, in that case, I feel differently,’ I said, ‘but I don’t believe it.’ I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, ‘Check, because I can’t believe it.’\\n‘Well, sir, you’re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn’t include energy and timber. … And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.’ It’s incredible.”\\nThe Office of the United States Trade Representative says the United States has a trade surplus with Canada.\\n\\nSo Trump made sh*t up, and when Trudeau refused to accept Trump’s lie, a Trump aide went out and searched around until they found a number that made Trump seem right. According to U.S. data, the U.S. has a $7.7 billion surplus with Canada, while according to Canadian data, Canada has a $14.6 billion surplus. If the entire question of whether the U.S. has a trade surplus or deficit with Canada hinges on how you measure it and to make Trump seem right you have to go with the Canadian data, it’s for damn sure false that “we’re getting killed.”\\nBut more than the question of whether Trump was right or wrong when\\xa0he went on how “I feel” and insisted on the thing he wanted to be true, there’s the reality that this is how the president of the United States is dealing with other world leaders—with close allies, no less. Leaders of other countries know that Donald Trump will sit down and lie to their faces. He’ll lie when he knows better and he’ll lie when he doesn’t know a damn thing because he didn’t bother to prepare for a meeting. Negotiating with him—on, say, steel and aluminum tariffs, or for that matter on relations with North Korea—will mean negotiating with a constantly shifting quicksand of lies, fantasies, and ego.\\n\\n\\n Thank you for your support of Daily Kos.\\n Media outlets shed 28,637 jobs last year alone.

Washington: Drug dealers kill people, destroy families and might deserve the death penalty or life in prison for their crimes, President Trump says. Trump, speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania for congressional candidate Rick Saccone, said he got the idea from the leaders of China and Singapore. The US criminal justice system, Trump said, is too soft on drugs. \"You kill 5000 people with drugs because you\\'re smuggling them in and you are making a lot of money and people are dying. And they don\\'t even put you in jail,\" Trump said. \"That\\'s why we have a problem, folks. I don\\'t think we should play games.\"     President Donald Trump, acknowledges the crowd during a campaign rally with Republican Rick Saccone on Saturday.   Trump said he recently asked the president of Singapore if that country has a drug problem.   \"He said \\'We have a zero tolerance policy. That means if we catch a drug dealer, death penalty,\\'\" Trump said. Trump said he wasn\\'t sure whether the nation would be accepting of such a harsh penalty. But he said drug dealers destroy families. Loading \"We can\\'t just keep setting up blue ribbon committees\" that do nothing but \"talk, talk, talk,\" Trump said. Trump has floated the idea before. Less than two weeks ago, Trump suggested \"very strong\" penalties to hep address opioid addiction.     \"Some countries have a very, very tough penalty -- the ultimate penalty,\" Trump said. \"And, by the way, they have much less of a drug problem than we do.\"     Protesters march towards the Presidential Palace in Manila, Philippines, to protest against Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.Credit:AP    Last May, Trump congratulated Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte for a \"great job\" in his crackdown on drugs.

Human rights groups and the United Nations have condemned Duterte\\'s vigilante-style campaign that has left thousands of suspected drug dealers and users dead. Trump acknowledged Saturday that his idea might have dissenters. \"Probably you\\'ll have some people who say \\'Oh, that\\'s not nice,\" Trump said. \"But we have to do something.\"   MCT       Stormy Daniels says that when she knocked\\xa0at Donald Trump’s private bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in July 2007,\\xa0she found the “Celebrity Apprentice” figure already engaged. Too busy to talk business or jump into what the adult film star would later describe as extramarital sex.\\xa0Everything had to wait. Trump was\\xa0glued\\xa0— like millions of others in more than 70 countries — to the television.  “I remember arriving, and he was watching ‘Shark Week,’ ” Daniels told Anderson Cooper in\\xa0an interview with\\xa0“60 Minutes” on Sunday. “He made me sit and watch an entire documentary about shark attacks.” “It wasn’t at that point a business meeting,” Cooper asked his interview subject. “It was just watching ‘Shark Week?’ ” “Yeah,” Daniels said. It was one of the\\xa0odder vivid details to\\xa0emerge from the\\xa0L’Affaire\\xa0Daniels\\xa0currently\\xa0engulfing the White House\\xa0and the Trump orbit. Nor was it the first time Daniels mentioned “Shark Week” and Trump’s feelings for the animal.\\xa0 “He is obsessed with sharks. Terrified of sharks,” Daniels told In Touch Weekly, again recounting Trump watching “Shark Week.” “He was like, ‘I donate to all these charities, and I would never donate to any charity that helps sharks. I hope all the sharks die.’ He was, like, riveted. He was, like, obsessed.” But if Daniels\\xa0is\\xa0to\\xa0be believed, the future president’s choice of programming is not much of a surprise.\\xa0    In an interview that aired March 25, Stormy Daniels said she was threatened for attempting to tell her story about an alleged affair with Donald Trump in 2006. (Video: Patrick Martin/The Washington Post)    Since launching in 1988,\\xa0Discovery’s seven-day marathon of shark-related content has\\xa0hauled in millions of viewers;\\xa0“Shark Week” has become television’s longest-running annual programming event and claiming a unique pop culture footprint. The week, which mixes “Jaws”-esque\\xa0documentary footage of\\xa0the ocean hunters\\xa0with\\xa0celebrity\\xa0guests and educational shows, helped fix the Discovery Channel as a mainstay on cable. Stephen Colbert once said the event was “one of the two holiest of holidays” next to Christmas.\\xa0Last year, “Shark Week” shattered its own best showing for a single telecast, earning 5 million average total viewers with a show featuring a simulated race between Olympian Michael Phelps and a CGI shark. “Shark Week” will go down as one of the most profitable long shots in television history.\\xa0It may have all started with an idea scribbled on a bar napkin. In 2012, Brooke Runnette, then “Shark Week’s” executive producer, told the Atlantic the idea was the product of a “post-work brainstorming session” at a bar with Discovery executives John Hendricks, Clark Bunting and Steve Cheskin. “As I’ve heard it, they were just talking about what kinds of things would be fun to do on Discovery,” Runnette told the magazine. “And one of them said something like, ‘You know what would be awesome? Shark Week!’ And somebody in that nexus scribbled it down on a napkin. You know how that is. An idea in a bar comes from many fathers.” Two years later, Eileen O’Neill, then Discovery Channel’s group president, told the Week the idea’s genesis was more rooted in market knowledge. “It started with a scheduler and the founder of the company, John Hendricks, brainstorming,” O’Neill said. “They started with the premise that sharks are such predatory beasts, and rated well, and thought, ‘What if [we] took advantage of the August beach time?’ ” Wherever “Shark Week” idea came from, the network needed it badly\\xa0— something to jolt the interest of both viewers and cable providers.  According to the Washingtonian, when Discovery initially launched in 1985, the programming was dominated by nature documentaries that failed to snag ratings; the network hung at “1 percent of all television-owning households in the US.” The “Shark Week” concept was also picking up on the tail-end of the “Jaws” phenomenon. Steven Spielberg’s 1975 thriller about a human-gobbling Great white shark became the highest-grossing film of all time (but was knocked from that perch in 1977 by “Star Wars”) and spawned three sequels. “Shark Week” gave viewers real-life footage of the deep sea nightmare stoked at the movie house. The network’s “Shark Week” hit the airwaves on July 17, 1988. The schedule featured programs with titles like “Caged in Fear,” “Shark Callers of Kontu” and “The Shark Takes a Siesta.” “It was intended to capture the attention of the operators but also to drive consumer demand to say, ‘We would like you to carry Discovery Channel,’ ” Clark Bunting, a former Discovery executive, told the Washingtonian. “Shark Week was a way for us to have some fun and also try to attract other cable operators to say, ‘Wow, who are those guys?’ and ‘We should carry them.’ ” Ratings for the first shark week doubled the network’s usual prime-time viewership, the Atlantic reported. The programming also attracted more cable providers. By the next year, Discovery was in 40 million homes, according to the Washingtonian. As the concept pushed on into the 1990s, ratings continued to rise.\\xa0“Everybody was always fairly surprised that it kept working,” Runnette told the Atlantic. “It kind of taught us what it wanted to be, in a way.” That meant changing the game plan along the way. In 1994, Discovery tapped\\xa0Peter Benchley, the author of “Jaws,” to serve as the first “Shark Week” host. Five years later, Discovery ran its first live show, “Live from a Shark Cage.” Celebrities\\xa0— Sugar Ray frontman Mark McGrath, singer Brian McKnight, professional volleyball player\\xa0Gabrielle Reece\\xa0— were filmed swimming with sharks for 2002. But the basics\\xa0— shark footage and a summertime slot — tapped into a reliable\\xa0ratings gold mine. “Shark Week’s longevity is rooted in two genuine and enduring insights about summer TV in the U.S.,” Joel Espelien, a senior adviser with the Diffusion Group, wrote last year in an analysis. “First, there’s just not much new on TV during July and August (especially in non-Olympic years). The combination of lack of competition and viewer boredom created an opportunity, and Discovery was savvy (or lucky) enough to fill it. Second, kids are not in school, which means families are not besieged by homework and after-school activities.” Discovery’s own identity has become welded to the “Shark Week” brand. To promote the event, a 446-foot-long inflatable shark named Chompie was often stuck on the side of the network’s headquarters in Silver Spring, Md. Over the years, the event has come under fire from animal rights groups and some scientists, who take issue with the sensationalized portrayal of the animals. “‘What do you think of Shark Week?’ is the third most common question I’m asked as a professional shark scientist,”\\xa0David Shiffman wrote in Wired in 2013. “And the answer is complicated. … At its best, Shark Week educates people about the most misunderstood animals on our planet while inspiring them to protect the ocean. At its worst, it perpetuates fear and misunderstanding.” The programming hit a\\xa0ratings dip in 2016, but the much-billed “Phelps v. Shark” set a new telecast record in 2017. The network will be celebrating the 30th anniversary of “Shark Week” in 2018. “The shark is the star,” Runnette told the Atlantic. “Just keep showing that.”   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n New Book Claims Trump Vetoed Women of Color From Miss Universe If He Felt ‘There Were Too Many’\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Donald Trump with beauty pageant contestants.\\n Photo: Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n In an excerpt from their upcoming book  Russian Roulette , journalists Michael Isikoff and David Corn give an inside look at Donald Trump’s 2013 trip to Russia for the Miss Universe pageant (you know, the trip that reportedly promoted the Steele Dossier and rumored golden shower). The excerpt, published Thursday on Mother Jones, exposes Trump’s alleged racism toward contestants of his beauty pageant, including the claim that he vetoed women-of-color contestants if he thought there were “too many” competing.\\n Trump’s pageants always had an underlying rule that he be allowed to review the contestants before the actual event, which gave him the opportunity to overrule judge’s selections and place the contestants he wanted among the finalists. Isikoff and Corn write that Trump would frequently “toss out finalists” and replace them with other contestants he preferred.\\n “In short, no woman was a finalist until Trump said so,” the excerpt reads. One Miss Universe staffer told the writers, “If there were too many women of color, he would make changes.” The excerpt continues:\\n  Another Miss Universe staffer recalled, “He often thought a woman was too ethnic or too dark-skinned. He had a particular type of woman he thought was a winner. Others were too ethnic. He liked a type. There was Olivia Culpo, Dayanara Torres [the 1993 winner], and, no surprise, East European women.” \\n Additionally, another staffer noted, “If he didn’t like a woman because she looked too ethnic, you could sometimes persuade him by telling him she was a princess and married to a football player.” Trump would also reportedly reject women from competing in the beauty pageant if they “snubbed his advances,” according to the excerpt.\\n Read the full excerpt here.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Trump Reportedly Vetoed Women of Color From Miss Universe\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n    A new excerpt from the upcoming book  Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin’s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump alleges that President Donald Trump vetoed contestants from his Miss Universe pageants based on race.   The excerpt, published Thursday at Mother Jones, details Trump’s 2013 trip to Russia for the Miss Universe beauty contest. While the excerpt focuses mainly on Trump’s business interactions while in Russia, it also describes the managerial style he allegedly used at his pageants. The book, due in stores March 13, is co-authored by Michael Isikoff, Yahoo News’ chief investigative correspondent, and David Corn, Mother Jones’ Washington bureau chief. (Yahoo News is owned by HuffPost’s parent company, Oath.) According to Isikoff and Corn’s research, Trump always had the final say in who won the pageant. The authors say Trump often vetoed contestants of color when he believed there were too many.  A day or two before the 2013 Miss Universe pageant, Trump reportedly reviewed the contestants and picked who he wanted to be in the final round.  “In short, no woman was a finalist until Trump said so,” Isikoff and Corn write. According to one staffer, Trump would “toss out finalists” whom the judges had chosen and replace them with women he preferred. The contestants he tended to toss out, the staffer said, were women of color:   “If there were too many women of color, he would make changes,” a Miss Universe staffer later noted. Another Miss Universe staffer recalled, “He often thought a woman was too ethnic or too dark-skinned. He had a particular type of woman he thought was a winner. Others were too ethnic. He liked a type. There was Olivia Culpo, Dayanara Torres [the 1993 winner], and, no surprise, East European women.” On occasion, according to this staffer, Trump would reject a woman “who had snubbed his advances.”   One Miss Universe employee told Isikoff and Corn that if Trump didn’t like a contestant “because she looked too ethnic,” he could sometimes be persuaded by “telling him she was a princess and married to a football player.”   Multiple former Miss Universe contestants have accused Trump of walking into their changing rooms unannounced. Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado said in 2016 that Trump once referred to her as “Miss Piggy,” “Miss Housekeeping” and “an eating machine.”   In 2016, former Miss Teen USA winner Kamie Crawford said she was warned that “Trump doesn’t like black people.” She said she saw Trump turn his back to a black Miss Universe contestant who was rehearsing on stage, and “[make] a face like he was going to vomit at the sight of her.”  Trump has a long history of racist remarks and actions, including refusing to condemn white supremacists who campaigned for him and referring to Mexican immigrants as “criminals” and “rapists.” The president has also been accused of sexual misconduct, ranging from harassment to assault and rape, by 21 women.   Head over to Mother Jones to read the full book excerpt.      A former Playboy model apologized to first lady Melania Trump for a 10-month affair she claims she had with President Donald Trump that started with him offering her money after the first time they had sex. During an interview with CNN\\'s Anderson Cooper that aired Thursday night, Karen McDougal said Trump tried to pay her after their first sexual tryst at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2006. \"Well, after we had been intimate, he, he tried to pay me. And I actually didn\\'t know how to take that,\" she said. \"But I looked at him and I said, \\'That\\'s not me. I\\'m not that kind of girl.\\'\"   We apologize, this video has expired.     She cried on the way home and didn\\'t think she would see him again, but agreed to go on other dates with him after he called her back, she said. McDougal repeatedly described Trump as \"very charming\" and \"sweet.\" McDougal said she continued the relationship with Trump for about 10 months and broke it off in April 2007 because she felt guilty. She recalled traveling to meet Trump at his properties in New York and New Jersey and said she had sex with him \"many dozens of times.\" McDougal said they also spent time at a resort at Lake Tahoe in California, where adult film actress Stormy Daniels has said she met Trump. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, said in a lawsuit filed earlier this month that she had an \"intimate\" relationship with Trump in 2006 and 2007, and she is now locked in a legal battle over whether she can publicly discuss it. Daniels signed a nondisclosure agreement shortly before the 2016 election in exchange for a $130,000 payment facilitated by Trump attorney Michael Cohen. For her part McDougal said she never wanted to discuss her relationship and repeatedly rebuffed inquiries from reporters about the alleged affair. But after the story became public, she wanted to get out and tell her side of what happened, she said. The White House has said Trump denies having an affair with McDougal and did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the interview Thursday night. \"He always told me he loved me.\" On Tuesday, she filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles against the company that owns the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer, which she said paid her $150,000 during the presidential campaign for the rights to her story of an affair, but never ran the story. McDougal\\'s lawsuit, which asks a judge to invalidate the contract, alleges that Trump\\'s attorney, Michael Cohen, was secretly involved in her discussions with the tabloid\\'s parent company, American Media, Inc. The company has said that McDougal has been allowed to speak about her relationship since 2016 and the contract gave them discretion over whether to publish the story. McDougal said she had feelings for Trump, but the affair was \"just tearing me apart.\" \"There was a real relationship there. There were real feelings,\" she said. \"He would call me baby or he would call me beautiful Karen.\" Asked if Trump ever said he loved her, McDougal said, \"All the time. He always told me he loved me.\" When asked if she thought this would lead to a marriage, McDougal said, \"Maybe.\" Trump married his current wife, Melania Trump, in 2005, and their son, Barron, was born in 2006. Speaking to CNN — in what her attorney has said would be her only interview about the relationship — McDougal apologized when she was asked what she would say to Melania Trump. \"What can you say except, I\\'m sorry?\" McDougal said. \"I\\'m sorry. I wouldn\\'t want it done to me.\"  \\n\\tUS President and former host of The Apprentice Donald Trump is still under the impression he needs to fire one person a week until there is just one contestant remaining, sources say.\\nInsiders at the White House have confirmed that Mr Trump spends most of his week deliberating over a list of names before making the difficult decision of who to let go.\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n“We’ve tried to tell him that it’s not necessary.

The newspaper said in a report posted on its website that Trump had insisted to Trudeau that the United States runs a trade deficit with its neighbour to the north without knowing whether or not that was the case. Trump said on the recording that after Trudeau told him the U.S. does not have a trade deficit with Canada, he replied, \"Wrong, Justin, you do,\" then added, \"I didn\\'t even know ... I had no idea.\"      U.S. claims on trade deficit with Canada inflated by misleading numbers     \\'Canadians should understand that we are under attack,\\' says Canada\\'s former trade ambassador      The president said he then \"sent one of our guys out\" to check the prime minister\\'s claim. \"Well, sir, you\\'re actually right,\" Trump says in the recording. \"We have no deficit but that doesn\\'t include energy and timber and when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.

Not wonderful for us.\" U.S. runs trade surplus with Canada, U.S. says But a different story is told in the recently released 2018 White House \"Economic Report of the President\" — an annual document prepared by Trump\\'s own team which bears his signature and contradicts a number of trade statements and policies already articulated by him. One example involves the supposed trade deficit with Canada. Trump keeps insisting it exists, but the document he signed states Canada is among the few countries in the world with whom the U.S. runs a surplus. The document states: \"The United States ran a trade surplus of $2.6 billion with Canada on a balance-of-payments basis.\"       AnalysisANALYSIS | Trump\\'s shoot-from-the-hip politics could make for bad economics      Transport Minister Marc Garneau,\\xa0chair of the cabinet committee on Canada-U.S. relations, reiterated Thursday his government\\'s long-held stance that it\\'s actually the U.S. that has a trade surplus. \"At this point it\\'s very important to point out\\xa0that there is over $2 billion a day of trade between our two countries and overall annually the United States has a small surplus with Canada of about $8 billion,\" he told reporters in Montreal. \"So we can talk about balanced trade between the two countries, huge amounts of trade, and\\xa0this is something we want to continue to improve as we negotiate the NAFTA agreement.\" Bruce Heyman, the U.S. ambassador to Canada until January, blasted Trump in a series of tweets early Thursday while also apologizing to Canada for Trump\\'s reported comments. \"Lying to your friends only hurts the relationship,\" he wrote. \"Canada has been there for us thru thick and thin. How can you casually damage this relationship? Shame on you!\" Heyman added that the president is \"casually throwing Canada under the bus and this is just wrong.\"   We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive).

Chinese President Xi Jinping recently consolidated power. Trump told the gathering: “He’s now president for life. President for life. And he’s great.” Trump added, “I think it’s great.

Related: How Did Melania Trump Secure \\'Genius Visa\\' For \\'Extraordinary Ability\\' While Dating the Future President?   \"He often thought a woman was too ethnic or too dark-skinned. He had a particular type of woman he thought was a winner. Others were too ethnic,\" said a Miss Universe staff member in Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin\\'s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump, an excerpt of which was published on Mother Jones Thursday. \"He liked a type. There was Olivia Culpo, Dayanara Torres [the 1993 winner], and, no surprise, East European women,\" the staffer said in the book by journalists Michael Isikoff and David Corn. Trump would also occasionally get rid of a finalist \"who had snubbed his advances,\" the staffer claimed. The topic came up during Trump\\'s November 2013 trip to Moscow to oversee the pageant there—he owned the Miss Universe Organization until he was compelled to sell it in 2015 due to incendiary remarks about Mexicans that caused broadcasters to flee. Trump, under the rules of his pageant, had the final say on all finalists. Once the judges had made their selections, the future president would review tapes of the contestants, paying particular attention to those in which they wore swimsuits and gowns, the book states. Miss Universe Organization president Paula Shugart would sometimes counter Trump\\'s decisions in a polite fashion. \"If he didn\\'t like a woman because she looked too ethnic, you could sometimes persuade him by telling him she was a princess and married to a football player,\" a pageant staff member said. The staffers\\' accounts on Trump\\'s preferences on women correlate with his history. His first wife, Ivana, was born in former Czechoslovakia while his current wife and First Lady, Melania, hails from Slovenia. Trump also reportedly suggested that his eldest daughter, Ivanka, date American football star Tom Brady.  \\n   U.S. President Donald Trump admitted to making up information when he told Prime Minister Justin Trudeau the United States has a trade deficit with Canada − even though he had no idea if that was true. Then, he claimed to have subsequently discovered his fib was correct and the United States has a “$17-billion” deficit with its neighbour to the north. To top it all off, Mr. Trump suggested the United States doesn’t bother to include either oil or lumber in its trade balance calculations for an unexplained reason.   We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that’s how I know!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 15, 2018 \\n It all came in a rambling anecdote told by the President at the end of a fundraising speech, a tape of which was leaked to The Washington Post. At a private St. Louis fundraiser for Senate candidate Josh Hawley on Wednesday, Mr. Trump recounted an argument he had with Mr. Trudeau on the subject. “Trudeau came to see me. He’s a good guy, Justin. He said ‘No, no, we have no trade deficit with you. We have none. Donald, please.’ Nice guy, good-looking, comes in ‘Donald, we have no trade deficit.’ He was very proud, because everybody else, you know, we’re getting killed,” Mr. Trump said, according to a transcript of the tape published on the Post’s website. “I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know. Josh, I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid [at negotiating trade deals.] And I thought they [the Canadians] were smart,” Mr. Trump said. The President said he had one of his aides check the numbers. “’Well, sir, you’re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn’t include energy and timber. But when you do, we lose $17-billion a year,’” Mr. Trump quoted the aide as telling him. At issue is the balance of trade, the difference between how much in goods and services a country imports and exports. Mr. Trump believes the United States’ trade deficit is a sign that his country is being cheated by its trading partners. Most economists, and the Canadian government, argue the figure is largely inconsequential in determining whether a trading relationship is healthy. The United States, Canada and Mexico are renegotiating the North American free-trade agreement at Mr. Trump’s behest, as he seeks to tip the balance of trade in the United States’ favour. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis says the United States actually has a trade surplus of US$7.7-billion with Canada. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) – the agency charged with renegotiating NAFTA – calculates the United States’ advantage as being even greater, at US$12.5-billion. According to the USTR, Canada runs a surplus in the trade of goods but the United States more than makes up for it with a surplus in the services sector. It was not clear why the President seemed to believe “energy and timber” were excluded from the U.S. government’s calculations. Oil is a major Canadian export to the United States, and the two countries are currently locked in a trade dispute over Canadian exports of softwood lumber, but both goods are counted in trade-balance calculations. On Thursday, Mr. Trump doubled down on his claim. “We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do…they almost all do…and that’s how I know!” he tweeted.  U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday wrote on Twitter that \\'We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada,\\' despite data on from his own trade representative showing the opposite, and a day after he bragged to donors that he had insisted on the wrong assumption in a meeting with Canada\\'s prime minister. Reuters  Mr. Trudeau, who is currently on holiday in Florida, did not comment on Mr. Trump’s remarks on Thursday. “Canada and the United States have a balanced and mutually beneficial trading relationship. According to their own statistics, the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Canada,” said Adam Austen, a spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland. A senior Canadian government source said they don’t know what exact meeting Mr. Trump was alluding to in his remarks on Wednesday, as the trade deficit talk comes up almost every time the two leaders speak. The President has long been the focus of fact-checkers – a tally by the Washington Post found more than 2,000 false statements since he took office – but it is rare for him to admit that he does it. His book The Art of the Deal memorably described lying as “truthful hyperbole.” “It’s an embarrassment to the United States for the President to be lying to other countries. There are a lot of issues where the United States has made commitments to other countries; if they can’t have confidence in the word of the President, they can’t have confidence in those commitments,” said Jordan Tama, a foreign-policy expert at American University in Washington. Mr. Trump is preparing for sensitive talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un – a high-stakes gambit aimed at avoiding a nuclear confrontation. Roland Paris, Mr. Trudeau’s former foreign-policy adviser and now a professor of public and international affairs at the University of Ottawa, said world leaders learned a while ago to be careful when interpreting what Mr. Trump says and not to engage in a public spat with him. “Trump’s language is a mish-mash of selective facts, contradictions and fabrications, but his actions are a lot more important than his words,” Prof. Paris said. “I think that the Prime Minister has been handling the Canada-U.S. file very adroitly and it has involved not publicly provoking a thin-skinned President.” Mr. Trudeau’s shrewdness is, at least, one thing on which the President would agree. In the fundraising speech, he expressed some grudging admiration for Canada’s firmness at the NAFTA table, where Ottawa is fighting back against Mr. Trump’s protectionist demands. “Canada,” Mr. Trump said, “they negotiate tougher than Mexico.”    Former Playboy model Karen McDougal spoke\\xa0on\\xa0camera for the first time about the 10-month affair she says she had with Donald Trump shortly after the birth of his youngest son, baring the relationship’s most intimate details and tracing its arc — from the moment she first met the future president to what she says was her decision to end the romance later — in an intensely personal interview broadcast on national television.  The hour-long interview on CNN marked a particularly sensational moment, for both Trump, as allegations about past affairs draw more scrutiny, and the media, for whom McDougal’s in-depth questioning from host Anderson Cooper was a prime-time event. If Trump’s presidency and the headlines it has generated have been considered a reality show, this was the grocery aisle tabloid rebuttal. McDougal spoke about a physical relationship she says began in 2006,\\xa0alleging Trump offered her money the first time they were intimate and choking up as she recounted the guilt she felt for being a party to an affair. She reflected on the connection she developed with the “sweet” man she said she fell in love with and unflinchingly recounted some of the romance’s most\\xa0salacious details. “When I look back where I was back then, I know it’s wrong,” McDougal said, choking back tears. “I’m really sorry for that.” The interview\\xa0came just days after\\xa0McDougal filed a lawsuit\\xa0against\\xa0American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer, in the attempt to void her agreement to sell the story’s rights to the company for $150,000 about three months before the election.    Three women, Stormy Daniels, Karen McDougal and Summer Zervos, have filed various lawsuits related to encounters with President Trump. (Video: Joyce Koh/The Washington Post)    The affair took off in\\xa0June 2006, McDougal said, which would have been just a few months after the birth of Trump’s 12-year-old son, Barron. The two met during a filming for “The Apprentice” at the Playboy Mansion, where McDougal, who was Playmate of the Year in 1998, was working, she said. “He said hello and then throughout the night it was kind of obvious that there was an attraction,” McDougal said. Trump asked her for her phone number at the end of the night, she said. By his\\xa0next visit to Los Angeles, around his June 14 birthday, they had started speaking on the phone and had planned a “date” for dinner at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Trump’s bodyguard, Keith Schiller, picked her up and drove her to a rear entrance at the hotel, she said. “I’m thinking to myself, ‘Are we going to a room because I thought we were having dinner,’ ” McDougal said. The two did have dinner — in a private bungalow at the hotel, she said. “Then as the night ended,” she told Cooper, “we were intimate.” McDougal said that\\xa0at the end of the night Trump tried to hand her cash — an experience that she had never had before and one that left her feeling “terrible” and crying in the car ride home. “The look on my face must have been so sad,” she said. “I looked at him and said that’s not me, I’m not that kind of girl.” “I got over it, but it did hurt,” she said. Still the relationship between the two blossomed into something far beyond a one-night stand, McDougal said. For\\xa010 months, the couple saw each other\\xa0at least five times a month at hotels, at Trump’s golf courses, a property in Bedminster, N.J., and even at his apartment at Trump Tower, McDougal said. Whenever she booked a flight or a hotel, Trump would reimburse her, to prevent a paper trail she assumed, McDougal\\xa0told Cooper. Even so, she felt they formed a genuine\\xa0bond. “There were real feelings between the two of us,” McDougal said, saying she considered and “maybe” even hoped that their relationship could lead to marriage. “He always told me that he loved me.” Unlike the belligerent, invective-flinging character people see on television or Twitter, Trump was “charming,” and “caring,” said McDougal, who described herself as an avid Republican and proud Trump voter. She described the guilt she felt visiting the businessman’s Trump Tower apartment, where he showed her a room he said was Melania’s, where “she likes to have her alone time or to get away to read, or something like that.” “That’s when I thought maybe they’re having issues,” she said. “I couldn’t wait to get out. … Doing something wrong is bad enough, but when you’re doing something wrong and you’re in the middle of someone’s home or bed or whatever, that just puts a little stab in your heart.” She later met Melania Trump at an event, she said. McDougal said that the president was very proud of his daughter Ivanka and told McDougal she was “beautiful like her.” She says she decided to end the relationship in April 2007 because it was “tearing” her apart. “What can you say except I’m sorry,” McDougal said. “I wouldn’t want it done to me.” The tone of the interview was serious, as McDougal reflected on a relationship with a man she said she cared for deeply. Cooper\\xa0even pried into intimate details, such as whether\\xa0the two used protection when they had sex. (The answer, if you must know, was no.) The near-constant chaos and upheaval of the Trump administration has seemed at times to drown out other news events that would have been central scandals during previous presidencies.\\xa0McDougal’s story has surfaced recently, after\\xa0weeks of reports about his alleged affair with the adult-film star Stormy Daniels.    Here\\'s how President Trump became embroiled in allegations that he had a sexual encounter with adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. (Video: Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)    Daniels — who is scheduled for her own close-up with Anderson Cooper on the CBS program “60 Minutes” on Sunday —\\xa0was paid $130,000 by Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, to keep silent about the story before the election. She has also filed a lawsuit to void the confidentiality agreement, arguing in part that it was never signed by Trump. McDougal told Cooper that Daniels’s decision\\xa0“made a little bit of an impact” on her decision to speak out. The\\xa0two women’s stories\\xa0also appear to intersect. McDougal described spending time with Trump at a 2006 golf tournament in Lake Tahoe — where Daniels has said she first met and formed a relationship with Trump. “I knew he talked to ladies,” McDougal said, when asked by Cooper. “I thought I was the only one.” Cooper asked her about a denial issued by then-campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks in 2016 that the affair claim was “totally untrue.” “I think somebody’s lying, and\\xa0I can tell you it’s not me,” McDougal said. McDougal said that she began discussions with AMI around the time that Trump secured the Republican nomination — not because she wanted to but because a friend had convinced her that she should own her story, which\\xa0had started seeping out in rumors on social media. She considered sharing it with ABC’s news division, though they were not going to pay her, and\\xa0she eventually backed out, she said. Through negotiations with a lawyer that she had been connected with, Keith Davidson, AMI promised her the opportunity to write monthly columns for a couple of its magazines like Ok! and Star, and be featured on two covers, as part of a push to help her rebrand as an “older” model, she said. And in return, the publishing company would get the rights to the story, she said.    The New Yorker reports that Karen McDougal was paid $150,000 by American Media Inc. for her story about an alleged affair with President Trump in 2006. (Video: Reuters)    McDougal says she knew that they planned to squash the story, perhaps as a favor to Trump, adding that she now believes Cohen was involved — something alleged in her lawsuit, as well. “What model wouldn’t want that?” she said of the deal she was offered.\\xa0“It’s a win-win for me. I get the work, and my story doesn’t have to come out.” The suit claims that Davidson worked secretly with AMI and Cohen as “part of a broad effort to silence and intimidate” her. The $150,000 McDougal was paid for her story was split nearly evenly between her and Davidson — 45 percent went to the lawyer, the complaint says. Davidson said he could not comment because of attorney-client privilege. The White House, Cohen and AMI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Early last year, when this allegation became public, along with much of\\nthe rest of the dossier, Trump denounced it as “crap” compiled by “sick\\npeople.” Since then, the allegation has remained uncorroborated, a fact\\nthat has given ammunition to those who want to dismiss the entire\\ndossier as a fabrication. When it first emerged in public, the\\nhotel-room allegation’s credibility was so hotly debated, it split\\nthe legendary investigative-reporting team of Bob Woodward and Carl\\nBernstein, who won a joint Pulitzer Prize for their exposure of the\\nWatergate scandal. Bernstein, who helped CNN break the news of the\\nSteele dossier, last January, argued that it was “not fake news.” But\\nWoodward dismissed it as “garbage,” a comment that won him a thank-you\\nnote from Trump. In a new book being published on Tuesday, “Russian Roulette: The\\nInside Story of Putin’s War on America and the Election of Donald\\nTrump,”\\nthe co-authors Michael Isikoff and David Corn report an anecdote suggesting\\nthat so-called golden showers were a form of entertainment familiar to\\nsome in Trump’s circle, even if not necessarily to Trump himself.\\nAccording to the authors, both of whom are veteran, Washington-based\\ninvestigative reporters, in the early-morning hours of June 15, 2013,\\nsome five months before the alleged Moscow incident, Trump visited a Las\\nVegas night club called the Act that was infamous for its\\nsexually explicit theatre shows. Among the skits regularly performed at\\nthe Act were two in which semi-nude women would simulate urination\\nonstage. As Isikoff and Corn note, it is unclear whether these skits\\nwere performed on the night that Trump visited the club. But court\\nrecords confirm that they were in the club’s regular repertoire. The reason that court records exist at all is that the Act’s obscene\\nentertainment was, at the time of Trump’s visit, the target of a joint\\nundercover investigation by the Nevada Gaming Control Board and the\\nclub’s landlord, the Palazzo hotel and casino—which is owned by Sheldon\\nAdelson, a major Republican Party donor. A few months after Trump\\nvisited the Act, a Nevada state judge issued an injunction against the\\nclub, shutting down its “lewd” and “offensive” performances. In the\\ncourse of the legal wrangling, investigators submitted detailed\\ndescriptions of the the Act’s shows. These, according to court records,\\nincluded “simulated masturbation, simulated use of narcotics, use of\\ndildos, strap-on penises, simulated defecation, and simulated\\nurination.” In one skit, titled “Hot for Teacher,” an actor in the role\\nof a professor would write an obscene title for a lecture on a\\nblackboard, after which female actors purporting to be college girls\\nwould disrobe and stand over the professor, appearing to urinate on him,\\nbefore revealing a water bottle. In another skit, according to the court\\nrecords, two women would drink from champagne flutes and snort a white\\npowdery substance, after which they would undress, and one would\\nsimulate urinating on the other, who would catch the liquid in two wine\\nglasses and then drink it. Isikoff and Corn note that the Act closed after the judge ruled against\\nit, and that they were unable to determine which skits were performed\\nthe night that Trump attended, or even whether Trump paid any attention\\nto what was onstage. Instead, Isikoff and Corn write that Trump’s focus\\nthat night was apparently the cementing of a business relationship with\\none of his companions, Emin Agalarov, an Azerbaijani pop singer. Trump,\\nthe authors write, was wooing Agalarov’s wealthy and Kremlin-connected\\nfamily in pursuit of potential Russian business deals. “Russian\\nRoulette” quotes Rob Goldstone, a British publicist for the pop singer,\\nwho was also present at the Act that night, recalling Trump extolling\\nhis plans. Trump reportedly told Emin, “We’re going to have a great\\nrelationship.” Later that day, Trump announced that the Agalarov family\\nwould partner with him in presenting the 2013 Miss Universe competition in\\nMoscow. It was during the Miss Universe competition, in November of\\n2013, according to the Steele dossier’s sources, that Trump allegedly\\nengaged the prostitutes at the Ritz-Carlton. (The White House did not\\nrespond to a request for comment about the book’s allegations concerning\\nTrump’s 2013 visit to the Las Vegas night club.) A source close to Steele, who declined to be identified, described the\\noverlap between the Act’s performances and the Ritz-Carlton allegation\\nas “interesting.” He acknowledged that for Steele, whose life and work I\\nrecently\\ninvestigated for The New Yorker, the details in the new book are likely to be\\n“something of a two-edged sword.” As he put it, “There’s a risk that\\nthere was some conflation of the story,” meaning a blurring of what\\nhappened at the Act and what allegedly happened at the Moscow hotel. But\\nat the same time, he noted, “It does suggest that there is some kind of\\ntrack record here. This behavior was not unheard of in Trump’s circle.\\nSo in that sense, it adds to the credibility of the dossier.” (In\\n“Russian Roulette,” Corn and Isikoff report that Steele would tell\\ncolleagues his confidence in the Ritz-Carlton story was “fifty-fifty.”\\nHe treated everything in the dossier as raw intelligence material—not\\nproven fact.) “Russian Roulette” also sheds more light on Steele’s sources—whose\\nidentities he has fiercely guarded. According to Isikoff and Corn,\\nSteele’s sources include two figures whose expertise may be\\nquestionable. One source for the “golden showers” allegation, according\\nto Isikoff and Corn, was Sergei Millian, a mysterious\\nBelarusian-American businessman whose claims to have been an intimate of\\nTrump and his circle have been disputed by those close to Trump. The\\nauthors assert that Millian was an “unwitting” source for Steele—that he\\nspoke about Trump to an interlocutor without realizing that his\\nstatements were being conveyed to the former British spy. Millian,\\nhowever, has subsequently appeared on Russian television to deny that he\\nhas ever had any damning information about the President. The Steele\\ndossier, the authors write, “described Millian as a Trump intimate, but\\nthere was no public evidence he was close to the mogul.” (The Steele\\ndossier, however, did cite several other sources for the Ritz-Carlton\\nallegation, whom Corn and Isikoff don’t mention, including a “member of\\nthe staff at the hotel” and “a female staffer at the hotel when Trump\\nstayed there.”) The other unconventional source, according to the\\nauthors, is an unnamed woman whom they describe as “the paramour of a\\nKremlin insider.” In other words, as they put it, some of the incendiary\\nallegations against the President of the United States contained in the\\nSteele dossier may have begun literally as “pillow talk.”  \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n&quot;I was successful at everything I ever did and then I run for president, first time — first time, not three times, not six times.

The liberal media dislikes me,” Trump said. “I was always the best at what I did. … I went to the Wharton School of Finance, did well. … I started out in a Brooklyn office with my father, I became one of the most successful real-estate developers, one of the most successful business people. I created maybe the greatest brand.”\\n\\n\\nHe specifically called out NBC, saying that one of the reasons the network hates him is because he refused to sign on for another three years of his television show, “The Apprentice,” after 12 years on the air.\\nAnd to his detractors?\\n“So I was successful, successful, successful,” Trump said. “I was always the best athlete. People don’t know that. But I was successful at everything I ever did and then I run for president, first time — first time, not three times, not six times. I ran for president first time and lo and behold I win.”\\n“And then people say, ‘Oh, is he a smart person?’” he added. “I’m smarter than all of them put together, but they can’t admit it. They had a bad year.”\\n\\n\\n\\n  Photo via the Canadian Press/Sean Kilpatrick.      This story has been updated to include comment from a spokesperson for Canada\\'s minister of foreign affairs office.  In one of the least surprising news stories in recent times President Donald Trump apparently lied straight to Justin Trudeau’s face and then boasted about it to potential GOP donors. According to  the Washington Post , in a fundraising speech in Missouri Wednesday, Trump told a crowd that he lied to the prime minister about trade deficits during a NAFTA meeting. In Trump’s account of their exchange, the president repeatedly told Trudeau he was wrong in what seems to be a bizarre effort to knock Canada’s leader down a peg. [Full disclosure: this is a transcription of a Trump speech so it’s going to be a little difficult to follow.] “Trudeau came to see me. He’s a good guy, Justin,” Trump said, according to the Washington Post. “He said, ‘No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please.’ Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in—‘Donald, we have no trade deficit.’” Don gets a bit sidetracked talking about how “proud” both the leaders are before launching into his big prank. “I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know. … I had no idea. I just said ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid. . . . And I thought they were smart. I said, ‘You’re wrong Justin.’”   Trump said both he and Trudeau sent “a guy” to check out the deficits—in his comment Trump said “his guy” agreed and that the US runs a trade deficit of “$17 billion” with Canada. However, according to both the Washington Post  and  CNN , the US government\\'s own numbers show that the country runs a trade surplus with the Great White North. Indeed, even the 2018 Economic Report of the President (which has been signed by Trump) states that the US runs a surplus with Canada.   It’s an accepted fact that the sitting US president lies with the frequency of a seven-year-old kid but, much like a kiddo, he typically doesn’t admit to his lies. While the president seems to have snitched on himself so that he could brag about putting one over on the Canadian leader, his actions have been widely panned as stupid and meaningless. In a couple of tweets, Bruce Heyman, the previous US ambassador to Canada, went to town on Trump lying to Trudeau, saying that the actions of the president are “so incredibly detrimental to our relationship with our best friend.” “Creating a crisis where none existed before is no way to run our country,” he wrote in a follow-up tweet. “Canada is our best friend and don’t ever forget it! We should never put the relationship at risk.”       President Deals responded to the Washington Post’s report Thursday morning on Twitter, stating, “Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the US (negotiating), but they do…they almost all do…and that’s how I know!” Thanks for clearing things up, Don! In an emailed statement Adam Austen, a spokesperson for Chrystia Freeland, Canada\\'s minister of foreign affairs, confirmed to VICE that the US does have a trade surplus with Canada but did not address Trump\\'s actions directly. \"Canada and the United States have a balanced and mutually beneficial trading relationship,\" said Austen. \"According to their own statistics, the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Canada.\" \"We are energetically at work modernizing and updating NAFTA to support good jobs and the middle class in Canada, the United States, and Mexico.\" It’s unknown exactly how Trump’s mockery of Trudeau went down—if it was all high pitched and screechy or nasally like an 80s villain would mock a nerd—but up here in Canada we know there are far more subtle ways to go about it. However the president did acknowledge that Trudeau was a “good-looking guy,” so at the very least Canada’s ever image-conscious leader can cling to that. Follow Mack Lamoureux on Twitter.

We made a speech. The place was packed, and we’ll see what happens.”\\nNoting that Democrat Conor Lamb, the apparent victor in Tuesday‘s election, will serve in Congress only for the rest of this year and that the district map is being redrawn, Trump said “it was a lot of work” for a lawmaker who is only guaranteed to be in office for a short time.\\n\\n\\nTrump also suggested Lamb won by pandering to GOP voters. “He said very nice things about me. I kept saying, ‘Is he a Republican?’ He sounded like a Republican to me,” the president aid. “But I guess when you’re popular in a certain area, that’s probably a good tactic.”\\nTrump’s remarks were reported earlier Wednesday by The Atlantic and The Washington Post. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\\nTrump also told Republican Josh Hawley, who is challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in Missouri, that he planned on coming back to the state to campaign for him, adding that he hopes to hold a rally for him at a “big arena.”\\nLamb’s apparent victory in the traditionally Republican region of Pennsylvania was a massive defeat for Republicans, and it raised red flags across the GOP about the potential for big losses in the midterms. Trump carried the district by 20 points in 2016.\\nTrump held forth on trade for much of the speech, complaining about trade deficits with other countries and arguing that they must treat the United States fairly.\\nThe president announced plans to impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports earlier this month, and he is preparing to unveil additional tariffs on China in the coming weeks for alleged intellectual property threat.\\nHe again raised the possibility of withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement, despite repeated pleas from lawmakers and his own advisers to remain in the deal.\\n“The best deal is to terminate it and then make a new deal. But I don’t know that we can make a deal because Mexico is so spoiled with this horrible deal,” Trump said, adding, “Sometimes something is so good, how do you negotiate? The best way: terminate. Let’s start all over again.”\\nTrump also bragged about falsely telling Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the United States has a trade deficit with Canada, even though Trudeau told him it wasn’t true.\\n“I didn’t even know,” Trump said. “I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’”\\nThe president also plugged his bid to eliminate the filibuster in the Senate. “Wouldn’t it be nice if we had 51 instead of 60?” he asked, adding, “Some of the senators that have been there really for a long time are just dead-set on that.”\\nTrump also touted his pending meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, and he resurfaced his complaint that the media isn’t giving him enough credit for the huddle.\\n“Erin Burnett [of CNN] said, ‘This could make him a great president‘ ... she actually said that,” Trump, an avid fan of cable television, marveled. “Even the worst of them — for two hours, three hours — they couldn’t believe. ... and then it happened, a day later: ‘Obama could have done that too.’ Obama couldn’t have done it.” \\n\\n\\n\\n  Porn Star Stormy Daniels confirmed Sunday that she broke Donald Trump down by spanking his bottom with a magazine featuring his face on the cover — and had sex with him only once. Daniels, in a highly anticipated, wide-ranging interview with \"60 Minutes,\" also revealed that when news of the sexcapade surfaced before Trump ran for President, she was threatened by a mystery man in a Las Vegas parking lot as she held her infant daughter. After agreeing to a dinner date in Trump\\'s Lake Tahoe hotel suite in 2006, Daniels said the future leader of the free world broke the ice with her by turning around and dropping his pants. Daniels, 39, said Trump had tried to impress her by showing her a magazine with his picture on the cover. The only cover Trump appeared on that year was Forbes. \"\\'Does, just, you know, talking about yourself normally work?\\'\" Daniels said she asked Trump. \"And I was like, \\'Someone should take that magazine and spank you with it.\\' And I\\'ll never forget the look on his face. \"I don\\'t think anyone\\'s ever spoken to him like that, especially, you know, a young woman who looked like me,\" Daniels said. \"And I said, you know, \\'Give me that,\\' and I just remember him going, \\'You wouldn\\'t.\\' \\'Hand it over.\\' And — so he did, and I was like, \\'Turn around, drop \\'em.\\'\"    Stormy Daniels, in a highly anticipated, wide-ranging interview with “60 Minutes,” said Trump broke the ice with her by turning around and dropping his pants. ( CBSNews/60 MINUTES via Reuters)    \"You told Donald Trump to turn around and take off his pants?\" correspondent Anderson Cooper asked. \"He turned around and pulled his pants down a little — you know, had underwear on and stuff, and I just gave him a couple swats,\" Daniels said. \"And from that moment on, he was a completely different person.\" Daniels went on to describe having sex with Trump that night, even though she was not physically attracted to him, and regretted putting herself in the position of being alone with him in his hotel room. \"I was like, \\'Ugh, here we go,\\' \" she said. \"And I just felt like maybe — it was sort of — I had it coming for making a bad decision for going to someone\\'s room alone and I just heard the voice in my head, \\'Well, you put yourself in a bad situation and bad things happen, so you deserve this.\\' \" Daniels, then 27, said the tryst was entirely consensual. She said Trump, then 60, did not wear a condom, and she did not ask him to. Daniels also said that during that dinner Trump said she reminded him of his daughter, presumably a reference to Ivanka Trump.    Front page of the New York Daily News on Monday. (New York Daily News)    \"You are special. You remind me of my daughter,\" he said, according to Daniels. \"You\\'re smart and beautiful, and a woman to be reckoned with, and I like you. I like you.\" Daniels said Trump, now 71, also told him that he and his wife, Melania, did not share a bedroom. \"Don\\'t worry about that,\" Trump said, according to her. \"We don\\'t even — we have separate rooms and stuff.\" She said Trump dangled the idea of an appearance on \"The Apprentice\" to keep her interested in him. Daniels said they never had sex again, although he tried to, coming on to her strongly after a meeting a year later during which they watched a documentary about shark attacks.    Stormy Daniels tells \"60 Minutes\" host Anderson Cooper that the tryst with Trump was entirely consensual. ( CBSNews/60 MINUTES via Reuters)    Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, said she never got the opportunity to appear on \"The Apprentice.\" She also told Cooper that several years later, after a magazine interview about the tryst, she was threatened by a mystery man as she went to a gym. \"A guy walked up on me and said to me, \\'Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,\\' \" Daniels said. \"And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, \\'That\\'s a beautiful little girl. It\\'d be a shame if something happened to her mom.\\' \" Daniels said she never saw the man again. The disturbing confrontation came after Daniels had done a lengthy interview with InTouch Magazine about her alleged sex romp with Trump.    Trump lowered his pants and allowed Daniels to spank him with a magazine, she said. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)    The interview was never published because Trump\\'s personal attorney Michael Cohen threatened to sue the gossip magazine. Daniels said she never reported the threat to police because she was terrified. \"I was rattled,\" she said. \"I remember going into the workout class and my hands are shaking so much.\" \"I was afraid I was going to drop her,\" she added of her daughter. After the broadcast, a lawyer for Cohen disputed Daniels\\' claim that \"an alleged thug\" threatened her. \"In truth, Mr. Cohen had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with any such person or incident, and does not even believe that any such person exists, or that such incident ever occurred,\" the lawyer, Brent Blakely, told Daniels\\' attorney Michael Avenatti in a letter.    Trump tried to impress Stormy Daniels during a dinner at his hotel suite in 2006, she said.     Daniels said the CBS interview was not in violation of a nondisclosure agreement she signed with Cohen before the 2016 election because Trump himself never signed it. She confirmed she was paid $130,000 and said she rejected much more money to tell her story. \"I turned down a large payday multiple times because, one, I didn\\'t want to kiss and tell and be labeled all the things that I\\'m being labeled now,\" Daniels said. \"I didn\\'t want to take away from the legitimate and legal, I\\'d like to point out, career that I\\'ve worked very hard to establish. And most importantly, I did not want my family and my child exposed to all the things that she\\'s being exposed to right now. Because everything that I was afraid of coming out has come out anyway, and guess what? I don\\'t have a million dollars.\" The \"Good Will Humping\" actress has offered to return the $130,000 she says Cohen paid her in return for her silence. Cohen admitted last month that he made the payment and told Vanity Fair he was doing what any lawyer would do for a high-profile client.    Michael Cohen, Trump\\'s personal attorney, refused to say why he paid Daniels. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)    But Brooklyn Law School dean Nicholas Allard said Cohen is in a real \"ethical box\" because \"he has either violated the professional responsibility that a lawyer owes their client or he is lying.\" \"An attorney is not able to operate as a free agent,\" Allard told the Daily News. \"He must have the informed consent of their client in representing them. An attorney just can\\'t go out and act and make decisions on behalf of his client without getting their consent. That\\'s legal ethics rule No. 1. Apparently Mr. Cohen missed that class.\" Allard also said it\\'s \"highly unlikely\" Cohen and Trump would be able to enforce the nondisclosure agreement in light of Daniels\\' going on \"60 Minutes\" because it\\'s \"astonishing how poor the quality of the NDA is and how poor the lawyering is on behalf of the President.\" Daniels had denied several times that she slept with Trump, but she said she lied in her denials because she felt she had no other choice. \"I was concerned for my family and their safety,\" she said. Fifteen months after she signed the nondisclosure agreement, news of the tryst — and the hush money — came out in a Wall Street Journal article. Since then, Avenatti has lashed out at the Trump team for intimidating his client. \"This is about the cover-up,\" Avenatti said. \"This is about the extent that Mr. Cohen and the President have gone to intimidate this woman, to silence her, to threaten her and to put her under their thumb. It is thuggish behavior from people in power. And it has no place in American democracy.\" Daniels was clear that she did not want to be mistaken for part of the #MeToo movement. \"I am not a victim,\" she said. \"I\\'ve never said I was a victim.\"  \\n \\n\\tKABUL -- When Asadullah Poya\\'s wife gave birth to their third child in a tiny village in rural Afghanistan, he immediately thought of Donald Trump.\\n\\n\\tNot Donald Trump the upstart politician, who at that time was in the thick of the 2016 presidential campaign, but Donald Trump the celebrity businessman. He had just recently read a Dari translation of what appears to be \"Trump: How to Get Rich,\" published in 2004 by the then-star of \"The Apprentice,\" and was transfixed.\\n\\n\\t\"I loved his personality. I thought he is the best at economics and he is great at politics,\" Poya said. \"I thought \\'This is a great man.\\' I liked the way he decides he wants something and then he goes and gets it.\"\\n\\n\\tSo when his baby came into the world in August 2016, and he saw that the boy had an unusual shock of blond hair, he named him Donald Trump, hoping it would bring him good fortune.\\n\\n\\tIt hasn\\'t.\\n\\n\\tPoya\\'s own parents were furious that he had given their grandchild a non-Muslim name. The imam of the village mosque devoted an entire Friday sermon to the matter, calling the name an insult. The opposition doesn\\'t have much to do with President Trump\\'s politics, but with the decision to break with tradition and name the boy for a non-Muslim.\\n\\n\\t\"Every day the situation got worse,\" Poya said. \"Every day in the house, when I was calling my son Trump, my father got angrier and angrier, until finally my father couldn\\'t tolerate it anymore.\"\\n\\n\\tIt was then that Poya decided to pack up his family, leave his teaching job and the family farm, and move to the Kabul.\\n\\n\\tPoya and his children ---- Donald Trump, his older sister Fatima and brother Karim ---- now live in a simple one-story house that they share with their landlord.\\n\\n\\tBut Donald Trump isn\\'t liked in the capital either.\\n\\n\\tOn Thursday, five neighbours approached the landlord and demanded he throw Poya out, calling him an \"infidel\" for not giving his son a Muslim name.\\n\\n\\tOthers have accused Poya of naming his son Donald Trump in order to improve his chances of gaining asylum in the United States. On the campaign trail, Trump had called for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S., but what about a Muslim refugee named Donald Trump?\\n\\n\\tPoya insists he does not want to leave the country, and that he never intended his son\\'s name to be in the news. He says a local government official in the district where he registered his son\\'s name posted the identity card on Facebook.\\n\\n\\tDonald Trump set social media ablaze.\\n\\n\\tPoya said he and his wife had to block their Facebook pages after they received a deluge of angry comments and threats. One user said four men were coming to kill him, while others called him an infidel or an atheist, a potentially fatal accusation in a conservative Muslim country.\\n\\n\\t\"But a name is a name,\" Poya said. If Donald Trump wants to change his name when he is older, his father says he is free to do so. \"But now it is my decision, and I have decided it is Trump.\"\\n\\n\\tOn Thursday afternoon, the chubby, 18-month-old boy was running around the house. His father called for the high-energy toddler to stop, but Donald Trump stubbornly ignored him. Then Donald Trump ran over to a computer and started slapping the keys with his tiny hands -- almost as though he wanted to send an angry tweet.\\n\\n\\t\"Trump! Come here,\" Poya shouted.\\n\\n\\tHe\\'s still a big fan of his son\\'s namesake, and says he would love to meet President Trump someday.\\n\\n\\t\"I would like to see him and talk to him and tell him please bring peace and stability for Afghanistan,\" said Poya. \"He is the president. He can do it.\"\\n\\n\\tUndeterred by the controversy his son\\'s famous name has ignited, Poya said that if he has a fourth child and it is a girl he would like to name her after President Trump\\'s daughter, though he had to be reminded of her name.\\n\\n\\t\"Ivanka Trump\" is unlikely to be any less divisive.\\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Trump: China\\'s Xi is president for life\\n \\n 01:12\\n \\n - Source:\\n CNN\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n Washington\\n CNN\\n \\xa0—\\xa0\\n \\n\\n \\n Donald Trump has said lots – and lots – of controversial things since he started running for office almost three years ago. But, something he said over the weekend – at a party fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago resort – struck me as particularly tone-deaf and dangerous.\\n \\n \\n Speaking about China’s President Xi Jinping, who led the charge to repeal the country’s term limits law last month, Trump said this:\\n \\n \\n “He’s now president for life. President for life. No, he’s great. And look, he was able to do that. I think it’s great. Maybe we’ll have to give that a shot some day.”\\n \\n \\n It’s not totally clear to me whether Trump was half-joking or not. Trump’s speech was behind closed doors. (CNN obtained a recording of his remarks.) And, in the news story on the speech, CNN’s Kevin Liptak notes that it was “upbeat, lengthy, and peppered with jokes and laughter.”\\n \\n \\n But, it is not obvious – at least to me – that Trump was joking about Xi’s power grab. Because, well, he almost certainly wasn’t.\\n \\n \\n It’s no secret by this point in the Trump presidency that he is someone who tends to heap praise on authoritarian dictators. Leaders from Turkey, Thailand and Egypt have all won plaudits from Trump. And then there is, of course, Russian President Vladimir Putin, who Trump has treated with kid gloves even as the US intelligence community unanimously confirmed that Russia was behind an elaborate attempt to meddle in the 2016 election.\\n \\n \\n Trump, throughout his life in politics and in business, has generally adhered to the “might makes right” view of the world. From urging attendees at his campaign rallies to “knock the hell” out of protesters to focusing on the need for America to be more feared than loved around the world, Trump has demonstrated that his governing theory is largely centered on taking as much as you can until someone stops you. \\n \\n \\n That worldview is what makes Trump’s thought on Xi all the more chilling. Here’s the key bit: “And look, he was able to do that. I think it’s great.”\\n \\n \\n “He was able to do that.” The moral question – should the most powerful person in a country be able to decide how long he or she serves – is entirely lost on Trump. The only thing that matters is that Xi was able to make it happen. If he was able to do it, that makes it right in Trump’s world.\\n \\n \\n On a micro level, Trump’s willingness to give president for life “a shot some day” should be very concerning to anyone who is a fan of democracy. There’s a reason, after all, that we have the 22nd Amendment in the Constitution. It’s not to protect the chief executive. It’s to protect the people. To ensure that the most powerful person in the country is not only subject to a performance review after four years – a little thing called the “election” – but that, no matter how beloved they are or how much more they want to get done, they simply can’t serve more than eight years in office.\\n \\n \\n On a macro level, Trump’s praise for Xi and interest in his move on term limits is in keeping with a broader lack of concern he has demonstrated in the idea of president as moral leader.\\n \\n \\n His reaction to the race riots in Charlottesville, Virginia, last summer was the leading example of the moral vacuum in the White House at the moment. Trump’s decision to endorse Roy Moore’s Senate campaign amid a series of allegations about sexually inappropriate behavior against the Alabama Republican was another. And now, this.\\n \\n \\n Trump’s redefining of the presidency takes all sorts of shapes and forms. Some are good molds to break. Others have little long-term impact. \\n \\n \\n But Trump’s willingness to engage in moral relativism and to stoke the notion that you take as much as you can until someone stronger stops you are the sorts of things that will likely echo well beyond his four or eight years in office. And not in a good way.\\n \\n  \\n\\tWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump says he thinks it’s great that China’s president now holds that office for life and muses that maybe the U.S. will do the same someday.\\nTrump’s remarks were met with laughter and applause during a luncheon for Republican donors Saturday at his South Florida estate. CNN said it obtained a recording of the remarks.\\nChinese President Xi Jinping recently consolidated power. Trump told the gathering: “He’s now president for life. President for life. And he’s great.” Trump added, “I think it’s great. Maybe we’ll give that a shot someday.”\\nTrump criticized his Democratic presidential opponent Hillary Clinton, repeated his view about “a rigged system,” and called the Iraq invasion “the single worst decision ever made.” He referred to former President George W. Bush as “another real genius.”\\n\\t  \\nThe New York Times: Digital and Home Delivery Subscriptions\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Offer for a New York Times News subscription; current subscribers not eligible.

He also mentioned the Republican candidate whom he endorsed. Speaking to a crowd of supporters in a packed airplane hangar outside of Pittsburgh, Trump gave one of his trademark speeches including a rare imitation where he feigned what it would be like to act “presidential”. The event was held to support Republican Rick Saccone who is neck and neck with Democrat Conor Lamb in a congressional district that Trump won by over 20 points in the 2016 election. Trump praised Saccone saying “he knows things other people don’t know” and bashed the Democratic candidate as “Lamb the Sham”. He also discussed the physical attractiveness of both candidates. Trump said of the 33-year-old Lamb “I hear he’s nice looking, I think I’m better looking” and then followed up by saying Saccone “is handsome too”.   But Trump spent most of his hour and 20 minutes on stage talking about almost every other topic under the sun. He confirmed reports that that he had been floating the idea of imposing a death penalty on drug dealers by a long discourse where he praised the criminal justice system in China. Trump noted China once had a problem with “the opium” that was “devastating” and went on to explain his bafflement that murderers were treated more harshly than drug dealers. “If someone goes and shoots somebody, kills somebody they get the death penalty,” said Trump. In contrast, he noted “a drug dealer will kill 2,000 to 5,000 people during the course of his life”. Trump acknowledged how controversial the concept was. “I don’t know if this country is ready but I think it’s a discussion we have to start thinking about.” It marked Trump’s most explicit public statements on the topic although he previously praised Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte who is leading a campaign of alleged extrajudicial killings against drug dealers and users. In the aftermath of the shock announcement that Trump would meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, he touched upon his relationship with the man he once publicly derided as “little Rocket Man.” Trump chided the crowd when they started go boo Kim, saying “we have to be very nice” ahead of the scheduled summit.   He went to attack his predecessors for not meeting with Kim and said his meeting would be a great accomplishment and had forced concessions from “a man who is nuked up all over the place”. As Trump described it: “They announce they’re not sending any missiles up … I wouldn’t say Japan was thrilled with missiles flying over Japan.” He also said he deserved praise for the success of the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. In Trump’s telling, South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in told him: “Without Donald Trump, the Olympics would have been a total failure.” He then opined: “It’s a little hard to sell tickets when you think you’re going to be nuked.” In addition to the coming special election, Trump looked back to the 2016 election where he derided a speech made by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts – whom he called “Pocahontas” – on behalf of Hillary Clinton for being “so angry”. He also dwelled at length on his victory in the electoral college. Looking forward, Trump announced his 2020 campaign slogan would be “Keep America great” since he had already “made America great again”. He also took credit for a congressional special election win by Republican Karen Handel in a suburban district where Trump was deliberately kept away for fear of alienating moderate Republican voters. As Trump often does, he went on several tirades about the media. He derided NBC news host Chuck Todd as “a sleepy son of a bitch”, called CNN “fake as hell” and vented about a Wall Street Journal columnist, calling him “a Neanderthal”. But one unusual target of his ire was Ronald Reagan. The 40th president is a venerated figure among Republicans, but Trump criticized his predecessor as “not great on trade”.      At the time, Donald Trump made no secret that he hoped Putin would attend the Miss Universe pageant   \\n\\tDonald Trump was so eager to have Vladimir Putin attend the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow that he wrote a personal letter to the Russian president inviting him to the event, according to multiple people familiar with the document. At the bottom of the typed letter, Trump scrawled a postscript adding that he looked forward to seeing \"beautiful\" women during his trip. Trump\\'s letter to Putin, which was described by people with knowledge of its contents, shows how interested he was in attracting the personal attention of the Russian president. The real estate magnate, who owned the Miss Universe pageant, wrote the note at a time when he was looking to expand his brand to Russia. The letter, the first known attempt at direct outreach by Trump to Putin, has been turned over to investigators probing Russia\\'s interference in the 2016 campaign. It is unclear whether Trump\\'s missive was ever delivered to the Russian president - and if so, whether Putin responded. John Dowd, an attorney for President Trump, said he was not familiar with the letter. \"It\\'s all nonsense,\" he said. A White House spokesman and attorneys for the Trump Organization declined to comment. At the time, Trump made no secret that he hoped Putin would attend the Miss Universe pageant, which was being held in Russia for the first time. In a June 18, 2013, tweet, Trump wrote: \"Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow - if so, will he become my new best friend?\" His letter to Putin was written that month, according to the people familiar with the document. The pageant was part of a years-long effort to bring the Trump name to Russia. Trump has repeatedly sought to build a tower in Russia since the late 1980s, without success. But in 2013, a new opportunity emerged through another business he owned: the Miss Universe pageant. Trump was approached by billionaire Moscow developer Aras Agalarov and his pop star son, Emin, who said they would pay to bring Miss Universe to the Russian capital. Trump was eager for Putin to attend the event, but the Russian president canceled a planned appearance at the last minute, Aras Agalarov told The Washington Post in a 2016 interview. \"That was a very complicated situation then, because I promised Trump he would meet Putin,\" Agalarov said. Instead, Putin sent a \"friendly\" letter and a gift of a Russian lacquered box, he said. \"So he was leaving with very warm feelings,\" Agalarov said. \"He was very happy.\" During the pageant, Trump suggested that Putin was following the event and Trump\\'s role in it. \"I do have a relationship, and I can tell you that he\\'s very interested in what we\\'re doing here today,\" Trump told MSNBC while in Moscow. Investigators for special counsel Robert Mueller III have asked witnesses questions about the Miss Universe pageant and Trump\\'s interest in having Putin attend the event, according to people familiar with the inquiry. Mueller\\'s team also has examined Trump\\'s relationship with the Agalarovs, which extended beyond the 2013 pageant. In June 2016, a music promoter representing Emin Agalarov emailed one of Trump\\'s sons, Donald Trump Jr., and asked if he would meet with a Russian lawyer who the promoter said could give him damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. \"If it\\'s what you say I love it especially later in the summer,\" Trump Jr. responded. Days later, he met with the lawyer at Trump Tower in New York. A U.S.-based employee for the Agalarovs also attended, as did Donald Trump\\'s son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Trump Jr. has said that no information about Clinton was provided at the meeting. Over the years, Donald Trump has offered inconsistent stories about whether he met Putin before he became president. In October 2013, a month before the Miss Universe pageant, he told late-night host David Letterman that Putin was a \"tough guy\" and that he had \"met him once.\" During a Republican primary debate in November 2015, Trump said that he knew Putin \"very well.\" But in July 2016, he told a CBS affiliate in Miami, \"I have nothing to do with Russia, nothing to do, I never met Putin, I have nothing to do with Russia whatsoever.\" By that time, Russia was widely suspected of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee, which had been published by WikiLeaks. \"I don\\'t know who Putin is,\" Trump said at a news conference the same day. \"He said one nice thing about me. He said I\\'m a genius. . . . I never met Putin.\" In the same news conference, Trump called on Russia to find and release Clinton\\'s emails. The following month, at a campaign rally in Wisconsin, Trump defended himself from criticism from Clinton that he wanted to befriend Putin: \"I\\'m saying to myself, what\\'s wrong with that? That\\'s good.\" - - - The Washington Post\\'s Josh Dawsey and Tom Hamburger contributed to this report.  (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)   \\n During a fundraising speech in Missouri Wednesday night, President Donald Trump reportedly told supporters that he made up a trade claim in a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, according to audio of the event obtained by The Washington Post. \\nTrump reportedly called Trudeau a “nice guy, good looking guy” and admitted that he told Trudeau that Canada has a trade deficit with the U.S., even though he had no idea whether that was actually accurate. \\nRead the transcript of the audio from the event, per the Post:\\n\\n“Trudeau came to see me. He’s a good guy, Justin. He said, ‘No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,’ ” Trump said, mimicking Trudeau, according to audio obtained by The Washington Post. “Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in — ‘Donald, we have no trade deficit.’ He’s very proud because everybody else, you know, we’re getting killed.\\n“… So, he’s proud. I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know.\\xa0… I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid. … And I thought they were smart. I said, ‘You’re wrong, Justin.’ He said, ‘Nope, we have no trade deficit.’ I said, ‘Well, in that case, I feel differently,’ I said, ‘but I don’t believe it.’ I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, ‘Check, because I can’t believe it.’\\n‘Well, sir, you’re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn’t include energy and timber. … And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.’ It’s incredible.”\\n\\nThe U.S. actually has a trade surplus with Canada, according to the Post. Trump on Thursday morning attempted to clarify his comments on Twitter, but claimed the U.S. has a trade deficit with Canada.\\xa0\\n\\nWe do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do…they almost all do…and that’s how I know!\\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 15, 2018  \\nThe Wednesday night admission is particularly startling given Trump’s announcement last week that the U.S. would implement tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the U.S. He also called the North American Free Trade Agreement a disaster and claimed key allies like the European Union, China, Japan and South Korea were taking advantage of the U.S.\\n    In a fundraising speech Wednesday, President Trump admitted once and for all that he just makes stuff up. The man who has racked up more than 2,000 false and misleading claims as president said he insisted to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that United States runs a trade deficit with Canada — despite having “no idea” whether that was the case. (Surprise! It\\'s not.)  “I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know,” Trump said. “I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid.” None of this is hugely surprising. Trump utters way too many falsehoods for it to be a coincidence. And we\\'ve seen over and over again — particularly most recently in meetings with lawmakers about guns and immigration — that Trump simply doesn\\'t do his homework beforehand. He generally doesn\\'t seem to have even a cursory understanding of what Congress is up to or about the underlying policies. But the fact that Trump would make up this particular fact is especially remarkable and ominous. The first reason is that this is perhaps the one issue Trump has focused on for decades: trade. It would be more understandable for him to make things up on guns and immigration, but trade is supposedly the issue on which Trump has been entirely consistent for many years. The idea that other countries are taking advantage of the United States was a talking point long before he became a politician. Trump for years has talked about\\xa0how the North American Free Trade Agreement is such a bad deal. And he threatened\\xa0Canada with new steel and aluminum tariffs, before he decided to exempt them, for now, as long as the NAFTA negotiations go his way.\\xa0 Yet he didn\\'t even know that the United States runs a trade surplus with Canada!?\\xa0If he doesn\\'t have that basic a level of background knowledge on an issue he apparently cares deeply about, what does he study?    President Trump boasted to donors that he told Canada\\'s prime minister that the U.S. has a trade deficit with Canada, despite having \"no idea\" if that was true. (Video: Reuters)    The second reason is that it was a rather pointless invention. Trudeau knows the truth: He\\xa0has been involved in policymaking for years and knows these things, because it\\'s very important to his job as a world leader. Why Trump would feel the need to make something up that is of such consequence to Trudeau doesn\\'t even make sense for strategic reasons.\\xa0It\\'s not\\xa0as if Trump was going to pull one over on\\xa0the prime minister and have the Canadians suddenly cave on NAFTA negotiations. The final part of this is what it says about Trump\\'s brand of diplomacy. This isn\\'t the first time we\\'ve got a glimpse behind the curtain. Early in his presidency, The Washington Post obtained transcripts of his calls with the leaders of Australia and Mexico. Trump\\'s call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull turned contentious after Trump became enraged by an agreement the Obama administration made with Australia to take some refugees. Trump didn\\'t seem to have any understanding of the agreement of Australia\\'s policy of not accepting refugees who arrive by boat.    Calls to Mexican and Australian counterparts give insight into Trump\\'s diplomatic style (Video: The Washington Post)    What happens if Trump takes this approach — or the one from the meetings on guns and immigration — to his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un? Can a guy who can\\'t be bothered to understand\\xa0the basics before talking to foreign leaders and lawmakers\\xa0do the kind of homework required for very sensitive and complicated negotiations involving nuclear programs? And what if he doesn\\'t even try? What if he decides to wing it, as he did with Trudeau? Thus far, Trump has shown no signs that he thinks\\xa0that\\xa0style isn\\'t working. And apparently, it\\'s still very much a part of\\xa0his international diplomacy.  \\n \\n \\n President Donald Trump boasted during a fund-raising speech Wednesday about making up facts about a bilateral trade deficit while speaking to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, according to the Washington Post.  The Post said it obtained audio, reportedly from a Republican donor, of Trump’s remarks at the event in Missouri, where he told the crowd that he had no idea if the U.S. had a trade deficit with Canada, but insisted to Trudeau that there was one.\\n \\n “He’s a good guy, Justin. He said, ‘No, no, we have no trade deficit with you. We have none. Donald, please,’ ” Trump said, the Post reported, appearing to mimic Trudeau’s voice.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n “‘I said, “Wrong, Justin, you do.” I didn’t even know. ... I had no idea. I just said “You’re wrong.” You know why? Because we’re so stupid. … And I thought they were smart. I said, “You’re wrong Justin.” ’”\\n \\n \\n  \\n — President Donald Trump\\n \\n   \\n “He said, ‘Nope, we have no trade deficit.’ I said, ‘Well in that case I feel differently,’ I said, ‘but I don’t believe it.’ I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, ‘Check because I can’t believe it,’ ” Trump reportedly said. “ ‘Well, sir, you’re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn’t include energy and timber … and when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.’ It’s incredible.”      According to the U.S. trade representative, the U.S. has an overall trade surplus of $12.5 billion with Canada. It is the second largest trading partner of the U.S., with total trade of $544 billion between the two countries. Trump on Thursday morning tweeted that he was right.\\n \\n According to the Missouri audio, Trump went on to accuse allies such as the European Union, Japan and South Korea of economically pillaging the U.S. for decades, and called the North American Free Trade Agreement a disaster, the Post reported. He also hinted at withdrawing troops from South Korea if a better trade agreement was not worked out. “We have a very big trade deficit with them, and we protect them,” Trump said, according to the Post. “We lose money on trade, and we lose money on the military. We have right now 32,000 soldiers between North and South Korea. Let’s see what happens.”\\n \\n \\n  Reporting from Moon Township, PA\\xa0—\\xa0 President Trump on Saturday again called for enacting the death penalty for drug dealers during a rally meant to bolster a struggling GOP candidate for a U.S. House seat here. During the campaign event in this conservative western Pennsylvania district, the president also veered off into a list of other topics, including North Korea, his distaste for the news media and his own election victory 16 months ago. Trump said that allowing prosecutors to seek the death penalty for drug dealers -- an idea he said he got from Chinese President Xi Jinping -- is “a discussion we have to start thinking about. I don’t know if this country’s ready for it.” “Do you think the drug dealers who kill thousands of people during their lifetime, do you think they care who’s on a blue-ribbon committee?” Trump asked. “The only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness. When you catch a drug dealer, you’ve got to put him away for a long time.” It was not the first time Trump had suggested executing drug dealers. Earlier this month, he described it as a way to fight the opioid epidemic. And on Friday, the Washington Post reported that the Trump administration was considering policy changes to allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty. But on Saturday his call for executing drug dealers got some of the most enthusiastic cheers of the night. As Trump spoke about policies on the issue in China and Singapore, dozens of people nodded their heads in agreement. “We love Trump!” one man yelled. A woman shouted: “Pass it!” Trump was ostensibly here to inject some last-minute political capital behind Republican Rick Saccone, whose race against Democrat Conor Lamb could be a harbinger of the Republican Party’s fate in the midterms. But in classic Trump fashion, he quickly steered away from his main reason for being there. He touted his decision to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and boasted that it was something his predecessors couldn’t do. Trump also delivered a profane attack on the news media, calling NBC News anchor Chuck Todd a “sleeping son of a bitch” and deeming CNN “fake as hell,” as the enthusiastic crowd booed at the mention of journalists and chanted “CNN sucks!” And he rattled off several falsehoods, such as a claim that 52% of women voted for him in his presidential win (it was 52% of white women, according to exit polling). The rally at an airport hangar in the Pittsburgh suburbs took Trump back to familiar political terrain and a base that carried him to a surprise victory in 2016. Trump talked up his decision this past week to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports -- a move deeply opposed by congressional Republicans and the business wing of the GOP yet popular in this Pittsburgh suburb, the heart of steel country. Both candidates in the special election to fill the seat vacated by Republican Tim Murphy back the president’s decision on the import duties. “A lot of steel mills are now opening up because of what I did,” the president told the crowd in this conservative district. “Steel is back, and aluminum is back.” Trump also warned allies in the European Union to “get ready for tariffs” and threatened to impose taxes on German automakers Mercedes-Benz and BMW. Despite his allegiance to Trump, Saccone has underwhelmed national Republicans in this heavily pro-Trump district, and public polling ahead of the Tuesday election has shown Saccone neck and neck with Lamb, a former federal prosecutor and Marine. For more than an hour before the rally began, Saccone stood near the entrance with his wife, chatting with people as they arrived. A number of people walked past, not seeming to notice or recognize him. Rally signs for the candidate were sparse. Trump himself rarely mentioned Saccone during the first portion of the rally, saying he believed the candidate was “handsome” and deriding the Democrat as “Lamb the sham.” But Trump also acknowledged that Saccone was in a “tough race” and urged his supporters to come out and vote. “We need our congressman, Saccone. We have to have him,” Trump said. Referring to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), the president added: “The only chance she’s got to become speaker is electing Democrats.” He finally pulled Saccone to the stage near the end of his 75-minute rally, as the candidate exclaimed: “If President Trump’s in your corner, how can you lose?” “Go out, vote for Rick. He’ll never, never disappoint you,” Trump said. “Vote with your heart, vote with your brains. This is an extraordinary man.” At another point in the rally, Trump also urged a crackdown on sanctuary cities and vowed to toughen enforcement at U.S. borders and to root out MS-13 gang members. “We have to build a wall,” Trump said. “For people, for gangs, for drugs. The drugs have never been a problem like we have right now.” He recalled his testy telephone conversation last month with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, which ended in an impasse over Trump’s promised border wall and an agreement to scrap Peña Nieto’s planned trip to Washington. Trump said Peña Nieto asked him on the call to affirm Mexico’s position that it would not pay for the wall. “He said, ‘Is it a dealbreaker?’” Trump recalled. “I said, ‘Bye, bye. We’re not making a deal.’” Midway through the rally, Trump hinted that he may not run for reelection, yet he rolled out a new campaign slogan (“Keep America Great!”) and took repeated swings at potential 2020 Democratic challengers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), again pulling out his “Pocahontas” taunt. He also went after Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), who has called for Trump’s impeachment , a “low-IQ individual.” And he couldn’t resist recounting his stunning electoral victory 16 months ago: “They said he cannot win, he cannot get — remember? - to 270. And we didn’t! We got to 306.” The rally in Moon Township had originally been scheduled for mid-February but was postponed after the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla. The campaign statement announcing the new date did not mention Saccone; rather, it said Trump would come to Moon Township to tout the GOP’s new tax law. This was Trump’s first campaign rally in more than three months, breaking his pattern of gathering with his strongest supporters as often as twice in a month. His last two rallies were aimed at helping Republican candidates in the U.S. Senate race in Alabama, although the president did not make those men the centerpiece of his comments. On Sept. 22, Trump held a rally in Huntsville, Ala., to encourage his supporters to vote in the GOP primary for Luther Strange, who had been appointed to fill the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, now the U.S. attorney general. While on stage, Trump acknowledged he “might have made a mistake” in endorsing Strange, who went on to lose the primary to Roy Moore, whom many of the president’s supporters had endorsed. Trump then backed Moore, continuing to support the former Alabama Supreme Court judge even as he was accused of sexual misconduct involving teenage girls when he was in his 30s. On Dec. 8, the president held a campaign rally in Pensacola, Fla., not far from the Alabama state line. Although those close to Trump had said the president would not mention Moore during the event, Trump did just that, telling his supporters: “So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it. Do it.” Moore’s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, went on to win the race, becoming the first Alabama Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate in more than two decades. Since those two rallies late last year, Trump has not held any official campaign rallies, although he did name his new campaign manager last month, Brad Parscale. But that doesn’t mean the president has refrained from giving addresses that sound a lot like his signature campaign speeches. Last month, Trump showed up at the Conservative Political Action Conference and gave an unscripted 75-minute address in which he attacked Democrats, mocked Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), encouraged campaign-style chants about locking up his political opponent and recited the lyrics of a song about a tenderhearted woman who cares for an ailing snake, a parable that he frequently uses to paint immigrants in the U.S. illegally as violent criminals.  \\n\\n\\n  President Donald Trump berated America\\'s allies and said he made up facts in a conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during a 30-minute speech at a fundraiser in Missouri Wednesday. In audio of his statements at the fundraiser  obtained by  The Washington Post, Trump said that during a face-to-face meeting with Trudeau he told Canada\\'s leader that the U.S. has a trade deficit with the country. \"I didn\\'t even know.... I had no idea. I just said, \\'You\\'re wrong,\\'\" Trump said he told Trudeau after the prime minister insisted Canada doesn\\'t have a trade deficit with the U.S. \"You know why?\" the president told the fundraisers. \"Because we\\'re so stupid.… And I thought they were smart.\"    \\nU.S. President Donald Trump welcomes Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the South Lawn of the White House before their meeting about the NAFTA trade agreement, on October 11, 2017.

Trump said Trudeau stuck to his guns: \"He said, \\'Nope, we have no trade deficit.\\' I said, \\'Well, in that case, I feel differently,\\' I said, \\'but I don\\'t believe it.\\' I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out.

He also described the North American Free Trade Agreement as a disaster and heaped blame on the World Trade Organization for allowing other countries to box the United States in on trade.   This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.   He also seemed to threaten to pull U.S. troops stationed in South Korea if he didn’t get what he wanted on trade with Seoul, an ally. He said the country had gotten rich but United States politicians never negotiated better deals. “We have a very big trade deficit with them, and we protect them,” Trump said. “We lose money on trade, and we lose money on the military. We have right now 32,000 soldiers between North and South Korea. Let’s see what happens.” “Our allies care about themselves,” he said. “They don’t care about us.” Trump’s rare comments that laid bare his approach to arguing trade facts with foreign leaders show how he might try to engage with numerous other heads of state in the coming weeks. Trump has said he will impose tariffs on steel and trade imports as soon as next week, a steep increase in duties that could impact some of the U.S. government’s biggest trading partners.   This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.   Trump said countries can request exemption from these tariffs but only after direct negotiations with him. And the audio from the fundraiser shows how difficult these discussions might prove. In his 30-minute speech to donors in Missouri, Trump heaped praise on himself while ticking through a list of U.S. allies that he said were actually taking advantage of the United States.  Our allies care about themselves. They don\\'t care about us  The president did not mention his abrupt firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by tweet, or the personnel turmoil that is swirling in Washington, or special counsel Robert Mueller III’s investigation into Russian meddling, or reports of his affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels – and his lawyer paying her off. While his White House picked up the pieces after a Republican lost a special election in a western Pennsylvania congressional district that Trump won by 20 percent in 2016, and pollsters said the results showed how Trump was dragging down the Republican party, Trump took none of the blame. He said that the candidate, Rick Saccone, would have lost even bigger without him. And he said the Democrat, Conor Lamb, won the seat because he was “like Trump” but that he would vote with Pelosi.   This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.   Trump was in Missouri to fundraise for Josh Hawley, who is taking on incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. He called McCaskill “bad for Missouri, and bad for the country.” But he barely spoke about Hawley. Instead, he talked about Trump – even bragging about his 2016 election win. Trump described his decision to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un through the prism of making history and besting his predecessors while lamenting his media coverage, questioning the United States allies and labeling his presidency as “virgin territory.” “They couldn’t have met” with Kim, he said, after mocking former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. “Nobody would have done what I did.” “It’s called appeasement, please don’t do anything,” he said of other presidents.

Maybe he’s not the one. . . Maybe we should send in the people that have been playing games and didn’t know what the hell they’ve been doing for 25 years.” The thru-lines of his meandering speech were simple: Trump was tougher than all the rest, and that the United States was not going to be laughed at or taken advantage of.   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump take part in a joint press conference at the White House on Feb. 13, 2017. Photo by Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press   He accused Japan of using gimmicks to deny U.S. auto companies access to their consumers, said South Korea was taking advantage of outdated trade rules even though its economy was strong, and said China had single-handedly rebuilt itself in the back of its trade surplus with the United States.

They take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and drop it on the hood of the car,” Trump said of Japan. “If the hood dents, the car doesn’t qualify. It’s horrible,” he said. It was unclear what he was talking about. He said he didn’t even want Japan to pay the tariffs but to build more automobiles in the United States, which he said Japan would do if tariffs were imposed. There is no evidence of such a possibility as of now. His comments were among his most protectionist to date and didn’t identify a single benefit the United States receives from its trading relationships. The so-called free-trade globalists, he said, are against his trade moves because “they’re worldly people, they have stuff on the other side.” Gary Cohn, the president’s top economic adviser, recently quit over the tariffs and was derisively labeled by his critics as a “globalist.”   This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.   Trump mocked other politicians for wanting to keep the NAFTA, calling Mexico “spoiled” and saying that Canada had outsmarted the United States. “The best deal is to terminate it and make a new deal,” he said. Above all, he cast his presidency in historic proportions, saying he was attracting so much media criticism because he was doing so well. He seemed fixated on his media coverage, with much of his story-time about North Korea focused on how the media covered it, even talking about a specific CNN segment with Erin Burnett. He said the news media was criticizing him for “conceding” a meeting with Kim. “They were afraid of being blown up. Then all of a sudden, they say, let’s not meet,” he said of reporters. While Trump said some decry his rhetoric and think his bellicose and mercurial tendencies could bring the United States into a war, Trump explained why he taunted the North Korean president as “Little Rocket Man.” He said the South Koreans told him Kim Jong-Un was agreeing to meet because of the tough United States sanctions and that they promised to not do any nuclear tests or missile launches until a meeting occurred. That comment could not be verified.   This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.   “He’s going to get us in a war,” he said, again mocking a news anchor. “You know what’s going to get us in a war? Weakness.” He said Republicans needed to run on their tax bill this year, but he was determined to not call it “tax reform,” as many other Republicans have done. He said Democrats would not appoint judges that Republicans like while reversing tax cuts and taking away guns, an unproven claim. He implicitly rebuked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., for not changing the rules of the Senate where only 51 votes were needed on all legislation, saying more Republicans were needed because the current leadership would not act and no one could explain why the current status quo made sense. Trump criticized judges in the Ninth Circuit, saying that his presidency would reshape the judiciary and change courts such as that one. He said he planned to pick 145 judges and gave a “thanks” to Obama for leaving so many vacancies. At the end of the day, the event, like it usually is with Trump, was about marketing. He said Republicans needed to run on tax cuts because they were very “popular.” “Do me a favor, don’t call it tax reform, it hasn’t worked in 45 years,” Trump said he told others. “You say, you’re reforming taxes, that means taxes could go up.” “I actually said, let’s call it the Tax Cut Cut Cut plan,” Trump said. “I actually did.” He added: “They thought it sounded a little hoaky and called it something else. I liked the first one better.”     Notice for the Postmedia Network  This website uses cookies to personalize your content (including ads), and allows us to analyze our traffic.

Trump says the deputies \"weren\\'t exactly Medal of Honour winners.\"\\n He tells 39 of the nation\\'s governors, \"I really believe I\\'d run in there even if I didn\\'t have a weapon.\"\\n Trump is vowing to turn the nation\\'s \"grief into action\" following the mass school shooting that killed 17 people. Trump says that while \"our nation is heartbroken,\" the US needs \"to have action\" on measures related to school safety and gun violence.\\n Eric Trump says there is room for \"common sense\" gun measures in the wake of a Florida school shooting.\\n Trump spoke on \"Fox and Friends\" Monday. He called himself a \"big Second Amendment person,\" but suggested support for raising the age limit to buy certain weapons and strengthening background checks.\\n Says Trump: \"We can\\'t have our kids shot up in schools.\" Since a mass shooting at a Florida high school on February 14, Donald Trump has offered a number of ideas. They include raising the minimum age to purchase assault-style weapons and arming teachers, though on Saturday he tweeted that the latter was \"up to states.\"\\n Congress returns to work Monday after a 10-day break under pressure to respond to the outcry over gun violence.   (This story has not been edited by News18 staff and is published from a syndicated news agency feed)\\n     Their first meeting was in Lake Tahoe, at a golf tournament in the summer of 2006. He invited her to dinner, she says. But when she got to his hotel room, it was clear he didn’t plan to go out.\\n“He was wearing pajama pants,” Stormy Daniels told InTouch magazine in 2011, describing what she said was a consensual sexual encounter with Donald Trump five years before. Trump has denied it ever happened.\\nIn Daniels’ description, this was an unremarkable hookup between two people in the outer orbits of Hollywood fame. Daniels was a star of adult movies. Trump’s reality show, “The Apprentice,” was slumping. At this Lake Tahoe celebrity tournament, the organizers had given him only fifth billing, listing the real estate developer two spots below Ray Romano in their lineup of stars.\\nNow, that casual night – and the connection it allegedly created between a future president and a porn star – has altered the course of Daniels’ life and threatens to alter the course of Trump’s presidency.\\t\\nDays before the 2016 election, Daniels agreed to remain silent about the alleged encounter in exchange for a $130,000 payment arranged by Trump’s longtime attorney Michael Cohen, according to a court filing.\\nBut in recent weeks, her story started leaking out. Last week, Cohen obtained a temporary restraining order from an arbitration judge barring Daniels from talking about the deal, according to people familiar with the matter.\\nIn response, Daniels sued the president, alleging that Trump and Cohen had tried to force her into silence with an invalid “hush agreement.”\\nOn Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reiterated Trump’s denial of an affair.\\n“The president has addressed these [allegations] directly and made very well clear that none of these allegations are true,” she said.\\t\\nBack on the night that started it all, Daniels has recalled, Trump didn’t say anything about keeping their encounter a secret.\\n“He didn’t seem worried about it,” she told InTouch. “It did occur to me, ‘That’s a really stupid move on your part.’ ”\\nAt the time of the golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, Trump had been married to his third wife, Melania, for a year and a half. Their son, Barron, was about 4 months old.\\nTrump turned 60 that summer. He spent much of it in California, where one of his favored haunts was the Beverly Hills Hotel, a pink stucco landmark, and the private bungalows on its lush grounds, according to people familiar with his visits.\\nSome people come to Hollywood to start their TV careers: Trump had come to reboot his. “The Apprentice” had made him world famous, but after five seasons, its audience had declined. The show had shifted its location from New York’s Trump Tower to Beverly Hills as part of a broader reboot.\\nLater, several women alleged that Trump made advances on them during this period – some of them unwanted.\\nKaren McDougal, a Playboy model, told The New Yorker that she began an affair with Trump when he was in Los Angeles around this time, recalling his repeated meals of steak and potatoes in his Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow. Another woman, Summer Zervos, has alleged in a lawsuit that Trump kissed and groped her in a 2007 encounter in a bungalow at the same hotel.\\nIn July of 2006, Trump traveled to Lake Tahoe for the American Century Championship, a tournament dominated by former athletes and TV stars. “Grab the shades with heavy UV because the star power is blinding: Lance Armstrong, Michael Jordan, Ray Romano, Charles Barkley, Donald Trump,” the organizers announced.\\nTrump was there for golf.\\nDaniels was there for work.\\nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was 27. She had appeared in more than two dozen adult films and had begun to direct some herself. She told InTouch that a company she was working for, Wicked Pictures, had been paid to bring porn actresses to the golf tournament. Trump offered her a ride on his golf cart.\\n“That was actually my first time on a golf course,” Daniels told Adult Video News, a trade publication for the pornography industry, in August 2006. “And when you’re riding around with Donald Trump in an Escalade golf cart during your first time out on a course, I’d say I was doing all right.”\\nDaniels has said that Trump invited her to his room, where she met a bodyguard named Keith. (Keith Schiller is the name of Trump’s longtime bodyguard, who later joined him for a period in the White House.) Inside the room, she said, she and Trump talked for a while before having sex. She said she wondered whether he would pay her, thinking to herself: “Please don’t try to pay me.”\\n“And then I remember thinking, ‘But I bet if he did, it would be a lot,’ ” she told InTouch.\\nAfterward, she said, he told her he would get her a slot on “The Apprentice.”\\n“I’m gonna call you, I’m gonna call you. I have to see you again. You’re amazing. We have to get you on,” she recalled Trump saying.\\nAnother actress for Wicked Pictures, Jessica Drake, has also said Trump made advances on her that weekend. In an October 2016 news conference, Drake said that Trump invited her and two other women to his suite, where they found him wearing pajamas. He kissed the women each in turn, without their permission, Drake said.\\nAccording to Drake, the group left Trump’s suite, but then a man called her and asked her to return alone. When she declined, Drake said, she was then called by Trump, who asked to her to come to his suite for dinner and a party. “What do you want?” she said he asked. “How much?”\\nLater, she said Trump, or a man calling on his behalf, called again and offered $10,000 and the use of his private jet if she would come back. She said she declined again.\\nIn response to Drake’s allegations, Trump’s campaign issued a statement calling her account “totally false and ridiculous.”\\nDrake and her lawyer, Gloria Allred, declined to comment for this story.\\nAs for Daniels, she said she kept in touch with Trump and saw him several more times, though she said they never again had sex. In one instance, she recalled visiting him at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where Trump watched the Discovery Channel’s “Shark Week” and spoke of his fear of sharks.\\nTheir relationship faded to a few phone calls and meetups at parties, Daniels told InTouch, and then faded away entirely sometime in 2009 or 2010.\\nShe never got her shot on “The Apprentice.”\\n“He broke the news to me that it almost went through but there’s somebody that had a problem and it got vetoed and blah blah blah,” she told InTouch. “I was like, ‘I told you you couldn’t make it happen.’ ”\\nIn the years after that, Daniels turned to directing, with dozens more credits to her name. In 2009, she contemplated a U.S. Senate bid in her home state of Louisiana but didn’t go forward.\\nIn May 2011, Daniels gave her interview to InTouch.\\nBut it didn’t run at the time. InTouch has not commented about why the story was held. The Associated Press reported that it had spoken to former InTouch staffers, who said that Trump’s attorneys had threatened to sue.\\nHowever, news of the alleged encounter appeared on a website called The Dirty in late 2011, prompting a cease-and-desist letter from an attorney for Daniels.\\nAfter that, silence.\\nDaniels said she kept the secret through Trump’s raucous, polarizing debut as a presidential candidate. But then, in the months before the election, she was in touch with reporters, including Jacob Weisberg, editor in chief of the Slate Group, seeking to tell her story.\\nDaniels had a lawyer, Keith Davidson, who was known for “pre-litigation” agreements, settlements intended to be sure that damaging allegations never see the light of day, according to people familiar with his work.\\nCohen, Trump’s longtime attorney, presented Davidson with a proposed agreement. He offered $130,000, she said, in exchange for her agreement to be silent again. (Cohen later acknowledged he “facilitated” the payment but declined to say what it was for.)\\nDaniels took it, 11 days before the election.\\nThen Trump won.\\nDespite the agreement, the story burst into public view in recent weeks. First, the Wall Street Journal broke news of the payment to Daniels. Then, InTouch belatedly published its seven-year-old interview with the porn star. Daniels embarked on a tour of strip clubs around the country, capitalizing on her newfound fame.\\nBut she said little about what actually happened back in the Lake Tahoe hotel room.\\nThen, in recent days, two things changed.\\nCohen sought to pull Daniels into arbitration last week, arguing she had violated the terms of the 2016 agreement.\\nDaniels’ new lawyer – an experienced litigator named Michael Avenatti – sued Trump on Tuesday, detailing some of Daniels’ claims in public court filings. The lawsuit laid out some details of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump and argued that the agreement meant to buy her silence was null because Trump had not signed it.\\nLawrence Rosen, an attorney for Cohen, said in a statement that he plans to fight the lawsuit and continues to “categorically refute the claims alleged by Ms. Clifford and her counsel.”\\nDaniels’ lawsuit hints that she has more to reveal. And it raises the question: Did Trump know about the agreement to buy Daniels’s silence, days before the election?\\n“Not that I’m aware of,” Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Wednesday.\\nIn an interview, Avenatti said he believes there’s no question that Trump knew.\\n“Any suggestion that an attorney like Michael Cohen with his level of education and experience would pursue such an agreement, negotiate such an agreement, make the payment, and then proceed in this matter without his client’s knowledge is absurd,” Avenatti said. “As they say down South, that dog won’t hunt.”\\n\\n The Washington Post’s Beth Reinhard, Mark Berman, Alice Crites, Tom Hamburger and Paul Farhi contributed to this report. \\n\\t  Donald Trump wanted Vladimir Putin to attend the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow so badly that he penned the Russian president a letter begging him to come, according to a report. The letter, written at a time when Trump was actively trying to promote his brand in Russia, included a hand-scrawled addendum in which he expressed excitement about seeing \"beautiful\" women on his trip, several people familiar with the matter told the Washington Post. It was supposedly during that trip that Trump engaged in \"perverted\" sexual acts with women at a Moscow hotel room, according to an explosive dossier compiled by ex-British spy Christopher Steele. Trump, who owned the Miss Universe pageant at the time, married First Lady Melania in 2005. It\\'s unclear if Trump\\'s pleading June 2013 letter was ever delivered to Putin, but, even if it was, it evidently didn\\'t faze the Russian leader, as he never attended the pageant. Investigators probing Russia\\'s meddling in the 2016 election have obtained the letter, sources said. White House lawyer John Dowd downplayed its significance.    Trump poses next to Miss Venezuela and Miss Universe 2013 Gabriela Isler after the 2013 competition in Moscow. (ALEXANDER NEMENOV/AFP/Getty Images)    \"Who cares?\" Dowd told the Daily News when asked why Trump wrote the letter. Special counsel Robert Mueller is looking into Trump\\'s apparent eagerness to have Putin attend the Miss Universe pageant, and whether a relationship was forged during the Moscow trip, according to reports. Mueller has also looked into Trump\\'s relationship with Russian oligarch Aras Agalarov, who attended the pageant and has connections to the Kremlin. Around the same time that Trump reportedly wrote the Putin letter, he also took to Twitter to marvel at the Russian president. \"Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss universe Pageant in November in Moscow,\" Trump tweeted on June 18, 2013. \"If so, will he become my new best friend?\"  \\n \\n WASHINGTON • For President Donald Trump, there are few gray areas. People are for or against him, and the names on the two lists are often interchangeable by the issue, the day — even the hour. He remains popular in big swaths of Missouri, Republican consultant Jeff Roe said, because of whom he fights with: “He fights with the press, he fights with the Chinese, the North Koreans. He picks the right fights.” Trump is contradictory, confrontational and confusing. While presidents through the years have honed homilies to the future, Trump often seems most comfortable talking off-the-cuff about the past, especially one day in particular. His 2016 election night victory, now 16 months in the past, is frequently mentioned by the president. “One of the greatest nights in the history of television in terms of people watching,” Trump said, mocking shocked TV talking heads,\\xa0at a raucous Saturday night rally in Pennsylvania for Republican congressional candidate Rick Saccone. \\n \\n  People are also reading…\\n  \\n \\n Trump is sometimes accompanied on this bitter nostalgic tour by his 2016 political opponent Hillary Clinton, who last weekend doubled down on her “deplorables” description of some Trump voters by telling an audience in India that Trump was elected by states, including Missouri, that were “looking backwards.” Backward or forward, Trump seems immune to irony. The 71-year-old former reality TV show star who is being sued by a porn star over an alleged pre-election hush money deal struck to cover up an affair, and who was caught on an open mic bragging about how celebrity gave him license to sexually assault women, is coming to St. Louis on Wednesday. After a roundtable meeting at Boeing Co., Trump will raise money for Attorney General Josh Hawley, 38,\\xa0 who says sex trafficking was caused by the 1960s sexual revolution. The Republican is challenging Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and who will run a campaign blaming Hollywood for perpetuating “a culture that is bad for the country,” in the words of Hawley consultant Brad Todd. To Trump, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un is “Little Rocket Man” one day, then a possible history-altering negotiating partner to address a decades-old, nuclear-tinged diplomatic stalemate the next. The president fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday, saying “we got along actually quite well, but we disagreed on things.” Trump’s attacks on the press are central to his governing philosophy, and they’ve escalated. He frequently calls out journalists by name at rallies and uses vulgarities to refer to some. He called NBC “Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd a “sleeping son of a bitch” at that Pennsylvania rally. Yet one of Washington’s worst-kept secrets is that Trump is phone partners with journalists from news outlets he routinely describes as “failing,” even though they are not. Trump’s roundtable discussion on the economy with business leaders will be hosted by Boeing, a company whose stock has soared under Trump’s administration, in part because of hefty new defense spending, including for the F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet fighter jets built in St. Louis.  But Boeing’s stock also took a hit in the wake of Trump’s announcement last week that he would impose targeted tariffs on imported aluminum and steel.  Representatives of nine other Missouri companies, ranging from College of the Ozarks to Kansas City Southern Railway, will participate in the forum with Trump, ostensibly to extol the tax cuts Trump signed late last year. All the invited companies announced either employee bonuses, capital investments or a combination as a result of the tax cuts. And yet, even the planning for the Boeing event was wrinkled with political intrigue. The White House first announced Friday that Hawley, Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft and state Treasurer Eric Schmitt would accompany Trump at that roundtable with business leaders.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (left) and State Attorney General Josh Hawley talk before the arrival of President Donald Trump at St. Louis Lambert International Airport on Nov. 29. Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Robert Cohen •\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   Then the White\\xa0House reversed course, saying only Trump would participate in the roundtable at Boeing, with a White House spokeswoman saying the change was designed to keep the focus on Trump’s policies. Hawley, who culminated a three-event campaign launch tour in Chesterfield Tuesday evening, will not have Greitens campaigning for him this year. Greitens “has plenty on his plate, and I would not expect to see him on the campaign trail this year,” Brad Todd, Hawley’s consultant, said. In a campaign appearance in Raytown, Mo., Hawley said he looks forward to having Trump’s support. But how does Hawley, a relatively blank slate as\\xa0a politician, associate himself with a president who can raise a lot of money for him, but who also comes with so many complexities and contradictions? Hawley will try to separate the politician from the policies. He will try to focus on cuts in regulations and taxes, and on Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s Supreme Court appointment, and leave to Trump the attacks on the Chuck Todds or the stormy headlines about porn star payoffs. “I think this is a lot less about the president’s sort of personal ratings (than) where his agenda is,” said Brad Todd, Hawley’s consultant, no relation to the “Meet the Press” host. “There is no question that Missourians voted for the policies that the president proposed in the campaign in 2016, and Claire McCaskill has helped him achieve virtually none of those,” Todd said. “And I think that she has to be accountable to the people of Missouri for the fact that she has tried to thwart the agenda that they supported.” McCaskill was too busy for an interview for this story, her campaign press secretary said. But she weighed in on Trump in an interview with the Post-Dispatch late last year. “I just think he is somebody who has been very polarizing,” McCaskill said. “He is one of the first presidents that I remember who has made no effort to bring people together.” Trump, McCaskill added, “is very focused on his base, the people who are very supportive of him. … And in doing that he sends a signal to everyone else that he does not care about bringing them to the table.” Which may be central to the Trump strategy as he campaigns for Hawley and other Republican candidates in 2018. Nonpresidential elections are “base elections,” the Republican consultant Roe said, “and you need your base fired up.” One Missouri political\\xa0scientist said Hawley has a tall order in trying to finesse his relationship with Trump, who endorsed the attorney general over three other Republican primary candidates when Trump appeared in St. Charles last November.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n President Donald Trump arrives at St. Louis Lambert International Airport, heading to the St. Charles Convention Center for a speech on his tax plan on Wednesday, Nov. 29, 2017. Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   “First, Hawley is\\xa0going to be associated with Trump no matter what Hawley does,” said Dave Robertson, chair of the political science department at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. “His political opponents will ensure that, just as they associated John McCain with the unpopular George W. Bush in 2008. Fair or unfair, this is a nationalized election, and Hawley would need a miracle and a major unforced McCaskill error to overcome the trends that work against Republicans.” Robertson added: “Missourians may support a number of Trump policies, but they are not terribly fond of Trump’s performance as president.” The latest RealClear Politics average of polls has Trump’s national approval rating at 41 percent, with 53.9 percent disapproving. It’s in the mid-50s in internal Republican polling in the state. “The question for me is, what’s the tipping point?” Robertson said. “How many false things can he say? How much vulgarity can he use?” But this president will have it no other way. At that speech in Pennsylvania over the weekend, Trump made fun of politicians who put on teleprompted airs; he even mocked the term “presidential” while speaking in a fake baritone about how he’d sound if he tried to do that. “If I came like a stiff, you guys wouldn’t be here tonight,” Trump said. “You’d be so bored.” “You’re one of us,” a woman shouted from the audience, and the people cheered.\\n \\n Get Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\\n Stay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our newsletter. \\n  \\n\\t\\n\\t \\n\\t\\n \\n\\t\\n\\tDonald Trump admitted to misleading Justin Trudeau, and now people have feelings\\t\\n\\tBy Toronto Life | \\xa003/15/2018 \\n\\t\\n\\tDuring a fundraising speech in Missouri, Donald Trump, famous for his tortured relationship with facts, did something he doesn’t often do: he admitted that, on one occasion, he said something that he wasn’t sure was true.\\nIn the president’s telling, he was talking to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. (This story probably takes place during Trudeau’s visit to Washington early last year.) Trudeau reminded Trump that the U.S. has a trade surplus with Canada. “I had no idea,” Trump reportedly told his donors. “I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid. … And I thought they were smart. I said, ‘You’re wrong, Justin.’” According to Trump, a White House staffer went to run the numbers and discovered that Trump was correct. Except, Trump wasn’t correct. At least, not according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, which estimates that the U.S. had a $12.5-billion trade surplus with the U.S. in 2016, when both goods and services are taken into account. And so, in trying to make himself sound like a master trade negotiator, the U.S. president has somehow achieved the opposite.

The excerpt, published Thursday at Mother Jones, details Trump’s 2013 trip to Russia for the Miss Universe beauty contest. While the excerpt focuses mainly on Trump’s business interactions while in Russia, it also describes the managerial style he allegedly used at his pageants. The book, due in stores March 13, is co-authored by Michael Isikoff, Yahoo News’ chief investigative correspondent, and David Corn, Mother Jones’ Washington bureau chief. (Yahoo News is owned by HuffPost’s parent company, Oath.) According to Isikoff and Corn’s research, Trump always had the final say in who won the pageant. The authors say Trump often vetoed contestants of color when he believed there were too many.  RELATED: Miss Universe 2017 Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters  A day or two before the 2013 Miss Universe pageant, Trump reportedly reviewed the contestants and picked who he wanted to be in the final round. “In short, no woman was a finalist until Trump said so,” Isikoff and Corn write. According to one staffer, Trump would “toss out finalists” whom the judges had chosen and replace them with women he preferred. The contestants he tended to toss out, the staffer said, were women of color:   “If there were too many women of color, he would make changes,” a Miss Universe staffer later noted. Another Miss Universe staffer recalled, “He often thought a woman was too ethnic or too dark-skinned. He had a particular type of woman he thought was a winner. Others were too ethnic. He liked a type. There was Olivia Culpo, Dayanara Torres [the 1993 winner], and, no surprise, East European women.” On occasion, according to this staffer, Trump would reject a woman “who had snubbed his advances.”   One Miss Universe employee told Isikoff and Corn that if Trump didn’t like a contestant “because she looked too ethnic,” he could sometimes be persuaded by “telling him she was a princess and married to a football player.”  Multiple former Miss Universe contestants have accused Trump of walking into their changing rooms unannounced. Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado said in 2016 that Trump once referred to her as “Miss Piggy,” “Miss Housekeeping” and “an eating machine.”  In 2016, former Miss Teen USA winner Kamie Crawford said she was warned that “Trump doesn’t like black people.” She said she saw Trump turn his back to a black Miss Universe contestant who was rehearsing on stage, and “[make] a face like he was going to vomit at the sight of her.” Trump has a long history of racist remarks and actions, including refusing to condemn white supremacists who campaigned for him and referring to Mexican immigrants as “criminals” and “rapists.” The president has also been accused of sexual misconduct, ranging from harassment to assault and rape, by 21 women.  Head over to Mother Jones to read the full book excerpt.   This article originally appeared on HuffPost.    For much of his tumultuous tenure, President Trump has made impulsive, gut-level pronouncements — about dealing with Democrats on immigration, tearing up the Iran nuclear deal and supporting stricter gun control — only to be walked back by his more cautious staff. Those days, it appears, are over. In the past two weeks, Trump has ordered tariffs on steel and aluminum imports over the fierce objections of his top economic adviser and agreed to an unprecedented meeting with North Korea’s dictator despite concerns from national security aides. On Tuesday, Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who had forged a tight working relationship with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to try to rein in some of Trump’s most impetuous decisions.  “I made that decision by myself,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. Though he was talking about North Korea, it is a mantra that has never rung truer in his nearly 14 months as president.    The Post\\'s Anne Gearan talked March 13 about the firing of outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the man tapped to be his successor, Mike Pompeo. (Video: Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post, Photo: Jonathan Ernst/The Washington Post)    Trump’s moves have shaken and alarmed a West Wing staff who fear the president has felt less restrained about acting on his whims amid the recent departures of several longtime aides, including communications director Hope Hicks and staff secretary Rob Porter. Late Monday, Trump’s personal assistant John McEntee, who had served from the earliest days of his campaign, was fired after losing his security clearance, further depleting the ranks of those the president feels he can trust. White House allies in Washington suggested that Trump has been liberated to manage his administration as he did his private business, making decisions that feel good in the moment because he believes in his ability to win — regardless of whether those decisions are backed by rigorous analysis or supported by top \\xadadvisers. This, they said, is the real Trump — freewheeling by nature, decisive in the moment, unafraid to chart his own course.    President Trump set a record for White House staff turnover in the first year. Here\\'s an ongoing list of staff who have quit or been fired under Trump. (Video: Joyce Koh/Washington Post)    “He’s running the White House like the Trump Organization,” said one person close to the president, describing Trump as increasingly at the center of command in White House decision-making and checking in on the status of projects by the hour. While Chief of Staff John F. Kelly is running operations, the ally said Trump is taking a more hands-on approach in areas including political messaging and strategy and the management of the Cabinet. Other people who have worked with Trump said his recent moves are an indication that he is concerned with the state of his presidency. “When he’s under pressure is when he tends to do this impulsive stuff,” said Jack O’Donnell, former president of the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. “That’s what I saw in the business. When he began to have pressure with debts, when the [Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City] was underperforming, is when he began acting very erratically.” O’Donnell pointed to the increasing pressure on Trump with the Russia investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and the scandal surrounding Trump’s alleged affair with a pornographic film star. “I think he likes the vision of himself being in control,” O’Donnell said. “I doubt he realizes the consequences of North Korea, just like he didn’t realize the consequences in business of walking in and firing someone at the Taj without thinking about it. It’s Trump.” Critics warned that Trump was overseeing a massive consolidation of groupthink within the West Wing, driving out top advisers who have challenged him on national security and economic decisions and elevating those who confirm his protectionist leanings — a signal, perhaps, to Cabinet members that they must fall in line or be the next to go. The National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn, resigned in protest over the tariffs decision. Tillerson, who had crossed Trump on the Iran deal and was more critical of Russian misbehavior than the White House has been, was summarily fired in a presidential tweet hours after returning from a week-long trip to Africa. Attention is now focused on the fate of national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who has had a rocky relationship with the president and has battled an internal power struggle for months. Eliot Cohen, who served as a State Department counselor in the George W. Bush administration, said Tillerson was the worst secretary of state in recent memory. But Cohen, who led one of the two “never Trump” letters signed by dozens of national security experts during the campaign, said Trump’s intent to nominate CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace Tillerson will lead to even less internal debate. Tillerson had dismissed the idea of direct talks with North Korea just days before Trump announced a summit with Kim Jong Un. By contrast, Pompeo on Sunday lavished praise on Trump’s strategy with Pyongyang. “We have a very similar thought process,” Trump said of the CIA chief. “This means conversations will be more of a never-never land than they already are,” Cohen said. “You will hear nothing faintly resembling candid disagreements.” The departures of Cohn and Tillerson, in particular, also represent a move by Trump toward his more nationalistic instincts.  Both men came to the White House after successful careers as top executives at international corporations — Tillerson at ExxonMobil and Cohn at Goldman Sachs.  They defended such things as climate change treaties and trade deals — positions that led far-right critics, such as former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, to deride them as “globalists” — and now that viewpoint will be far less represented in Trump’s administration. Last week, Trump said he liked having divergent viewpoints within the White House. But at Cabinet meetings, Trump has allowed reporters in to witness a display of unusual obsequiousness. In December, for example, Vice President Pence commended Trump once every 12 seconds for three minutes. “If you are going to work for the president, you fight it out, and if you lose, you don’t go behind the president’s back and attack it, you defend the policy,” said Stephen Moore, an economic adviser to Trump during the 2016 campaign. “If you can’t do that, you shouldn’t have taken the job in the first place.” But there are signs that aides have fewer chances to fight for their positions. On Thursday, Trump decided on the spot during a 45-minute meeting with South Korean officials in the Oval Office that he would accept an invitation from Kim to meet for talks — stunning senior aides, including Mattis and McMaster, who warned about moving too quickly. Jon Wolfsthal, who served as senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security Council under President Barack Obama, said most presidents would have convened an interagency meeting with the relevant federal agencies before making such a momentous decision. “A president could hear from his Cabinet about whether it was worth the risk and, if it was worth the risk, how they would make the announcement, who to inform first,” Wolfsthal said. Trump asked his South Korean interlocutors to announce the news in the West Wing driveway as he hastily tried to reach the leaders of Japan and China. Tillerson, who was traveling in Africa, was represented at the Oval Office meeting by a deputy. The following day, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders sowed confusion by telling reporters that the meeting was contingent on Pyongyang taking active steps to denuclearize, before one of Sanders’s aides later clarified by saying there were no preconditions to the summit. “The impression people are being given right now is that Trump feels he has been poorly served by his staff,” Wolfsthal said. “Cabinet secretaries aren’t doing the job he wants. He is relying much more on himself.” Or people who reflect his own image. One of the top candidates to replace Cohn, Larry Kudlow, a conservative television commentator who served in the Reagan administration, had previously spoken out against Trump’s tariff plan. But Trump on Tuesday said Kudlow “now has come around to believing in tariffs as a negotiating point.” Trump also met recently with former United Nations ambassador John Bolton, who is viewed as more hawkish on Iran than McMaster or Tillerson. The turmoil has unsettled U.S. allies and rivals across the globe. “I think the Chinese are reeling from this presidency,” said Bonnie Glaser, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. She noted that Beijing has sought to develop ties to both Tillerson and Trump senior adviser Jared Kushner, who has lost standing amid questions about his inability to gain a security clearance and financial debts tied to his family’s real estate business. “The Chinese ambassador has been going around quietly seeing very senior former officials and asking them who to talk to,” Glaser said. “How can they influence this administration? Every day is a new surprise for them.” Robert Costa contributed to this report.

More on this story        The president of the United States Wednesday boasted he had “no idea” what he was talking about when discussing international trade with America’s most important regional ally. Speaking to donors in Missouri, Donald Trump said he told Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the U.S. had a trade deficit with its neighbor, admitting he didn’t know if that was true. An audio recording of the speech, obtained by the Washington Post, revealed a meandering 30-minute address during a fundraiser for Republican Josh Hawley, who will take on incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in the November midterms. Rather than talking up Hawley, Trump lavished praise on himself, criticized the media, and lashed out at a raft of U.S. allies that he said have ripped off the U.S. for decades. Trump’s ramble failed to mention the firing of Rex Tillerson, the alleged hush money paid to Stormy Daniels, Gary Cohn quitting, Trump’s personal assistant being strong-armed out of the White House, campaign collusion with Russia, the special election defeat in Pennsylvania, or any of the other controversies currently engulfing the Oval Office.    Here’s what he did discuss:    \\n Canada: Trump called Trudeau “a good guy,” a “nice guy,” and a “good-looking guy” before mimicking the Canadian leader: “He said, ‘No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please. Donald, we have no trade deficit.’” Trump then told Trudeau he was wrong, before admitting to the donors “I didn’t even know. I had no idea. I just said, ‘you’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid.” According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the U.S. has a trade surplus with Canada.\\n Japan: Trump accused Japan of using gimmicks to deny U.S. automakers access to their consumers. “It’s the bowling ball test. They take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and drop it on the hood of the car,” Trump said. “If the hood dents, the car doesn’t qualify. It’s horrible.”\\n   \\n South Korea: Trump threatened to pull U.S. troops out of the Korean Peninsula because Seoul was taking advantage of outdated trade rules, even though its economy was strong. “We have a very big trade deficit with them, and we protect them,” Trump said. “We lose money on trade, and we lose money on the military. We have right now 32,000 soldiers on the border between North and South Korea. Let’s see what happens.”\\n China: Trump accused China of building its current economic position completely on the back of its large trade deficit with the U.S.\\n North Korea: Trump claimed the South Korean government told him it was the U.S. president’s war of words with Kim that brought the dictator to the negotiating table — though this claim has not been verified. He also took time to lash out at George W. Bush and Barack Obama for their weakness in dealing with Pyongyang: “They couldn’t have met. Nobody would have done what I did.”\\n        Cover image: President Donald Trump honors the Major League Baseball 2017 World Series Champion Houston Astros during a ceremony at the White House in Washington, USA on March 12, 2018.

Twitter has exploded over reports US President Donald Trump used a fundraising speech with donors to brag about lying to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump was referring to supposed trade deficits. According to the Washington Post, audio obtained of the speech reveals how Trump told a fundraiser on Wednesday that he made up trade statistics with America’s closest ally. Trump’s recounting of his meeting with Trudeau suggests the president lied to his political ally about trade without knowing the facts.  “Trudeau came to see [me]. He’s a good guy, Justin. He said: ‘No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, Please,” Trump reportedly said at the Wednesday event. “Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in – ‘Donald, we have no trade deficit.’ So, he’s proud.

McMaster as his national security adviser and is actively discussing potential replacements, according to five people with knowledge of the plans, preparing to deliver yet another jolt to the senior ranks of his administration. Trump is now comfortable with ousting McMaster, with whom he never personally gelled, but is willing to take time executing the move because he wants to ensure both that the three-star Army general is not humiliated and that there is a strong successor lined up, these people said. The turbulence is part of a broader potential shake-up under consideration by Trump that is likely to include senior officials at the White House, where staffers are gripped by fear and uncertainty as they await the next move from an impulsive president who enjoys stoking conflict. For all of the evident disorder, Trump feels emboldened, advisers said - buoyed by what he views as triumphant decisions last week to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum and to agree to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The president is enjoying the process of assessing his team and making changes, tightening his inner circle to those he considers survivors and who respect his unconventional style, one senior White House official said. Just days ago, Trump used Twitter to fire Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state whom he disliked, and moved to install his close ally, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, in the job. On Wednesday, he named conservative TV analyst Larry Kudlow to replace his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, who quit over trade disagreements. And on Thursday, Trump signaled that more personnel moves were likely. \"There will always be change,\" the president told reporters. \"And I think you want to see change. I want to also see different ideas.\" This portrait of the Trump administration in turmoil is based on interviews with 19 presidential advisers and administration officials, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer candid perspectives. The mood inside the White House in recent days has verged on mania, as Trump increasingly keeps his own counsel and senior aides struggle to determine the gradations between rumor and truth. At times, they say, they are anxious and nervous, wondering what each new headline may mean for them personally. But in other moments, they appear almost as characters in an absurdist farce — openly joking about whose career might end with the next presidential tweet. Some White House officials have begun betting about which staffer will be ousted next, though few, if any, have much reliable information about what is actually going on. Many aides were particularly unsettled by the firing of the president\\'s longtime personal aide, John McEntee, who was marched out of the White House on Tuesday after his security clearance was abruptly revoked. \"Everybody fears the perp walk,\" one senior White House official said. \"If it could happen to Johnny, the president\\'s body guy, it could happen to anybody.\" Trump recently told White House Chief of Staff John Kelly that he wants McMaster out and asked for help weighing replacement options, according to two people familiar with their conversations. The president has complained that McMaster is too rigid and that his briefings go on too long and seem irrelevant. Several candidates have emerged as possible McMaster replacements, including John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and Keith Kellogg, the chief of staff of the National Security Council. Kellogg travels with Trump on many domestic trips, in part because the president likes his company and thinks he is fun. Bolton has met with Trump several times and often agrees with the president\\'s instincts. Trump also thinks Bolton, who regularly praises the president on Fox News Channel, is good on television. Some in the White House have been reluctant to oust McMaster from his national security perch until he has a promotion to four-star rank or other comfortable landing spot. They are eager to show that someone can serve in the Trump administration without suffering severe damage to their reputation. McMaster is not the only senior official on thin ice with the president. Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin has attracted Trump\\'s ire for his spending decisions as well as for general disorder in the senior leadership of his agency. Others considered at risk for being fired or reprimanded include Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, who has generated bad headlines for ordering a $31,000 dining room set for his office; Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, who has been under fire for his first-class travel at taxpayer expense; and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, whose agency spent $139,000 to renovate his office doors. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos drew attention this week when she stumbled through a pair of high-profile television interviews. Kelly watched DeVos\\' sit-down with Lesley Stahl of CBS\\'s \"60 Minutes\" with frustration and complained about the secretary\\'s apparent lack of preparation, officials said. Other Trump advisers mocked DeVos\\' shaky appearance with Savannah Guthrie on NBC\\'s \"Today\" show. Kelly\\'s own ouster has been widely speculated for weeks. But two top officials said Trump on Thursday morning expressed disbelief to Vice President Mike Pence, senior advisers and Kelly himself that Kelly\\'s name was surfacing on media watch lists because his job is secure. Trump and Kelly then laughed about it, the officials said.\\nThe widespread uncertainty has created power vacuums that could play to the advantage of some administration aides. Pompeo, who carefully cultivated a personal relationship with the president, had positioned himself as the heir apparent to Tillerson, whom Trump had long disliked. Similarly, Pruitt has made no secret inside the West Wing of his ambition to become attorney general should Trump decide to fire Jeff Sessions, who he frequently derides for his decision to recuse himself from the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. White House officials have grown agitated that Pruitt and his allies are privately pushing for the EPA chief to replace Sessions, a job Pruitt has told people he wants. On Wednesday night, Kelly called Pruitt and told him the president was happy with his performance at EPA and that he did not need to worry about the Justice Department, according to two people familiar with the conversation. With Hope Hicks resigning her post as communications director, the internal jockeying to replace her has been especially intense between Mercedes Schlapp, who oversees the White House\\'s long-term communications planning, and Tony Sayegh, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\\'s top communications adviser. Trump enjoys watching his subordinates compete for his approval. Many of the rumors are fueled by Trump himself because he complains to aides and friends about other staffers, or muses about who might make good replacements. \"I like conflict. I like having two people with different points of view,\" Trump said last week, rapping his fists toward one another to simulate a clash. \"I like watching it, I like seeing it, and I think it\\'s the best way to go.\" Shulkin, meanwhile, is facing mounting trouble after The Washington Post first reported that he and his wife took a sightseeing-filled trip to Europe on taxpayer funds, including watching tennis at Wimbledon. Shulkin is now facing an insurrection at his own agency, with tensions so high that an armed guard stands outside his office. Another episode haunting Shulkin was a trip to the Invictus Games in Canada last September with first lady Melania Trump\\'s entourage. Shulkin fought with East Wing aides over his request that his wife accompany him on the trip because he was eager for her to meet Prince Harry of Wales, who founded the games, according to multiple officials familiar with the dispute. The first lady\\'s office explained there was not room on the plane for Shulkin\\'s wife, and officials said the secretary was unpleasant during the trip. Shulkin said in an email sent by a spokeswoman: \"These allegations are simply untrue. I was honored to attend the Invictus Games with the First Lady and understood fully when I was told that there wasn\\'t any more room for guests to attend.\" A leading contender to replace Shulkin is Pete Hegseth, an Iraq War veteran and Fox News personality who is a conservative voice on veterans policy, officials said. White House officials said there are several reasons Trump has not axed Cabinet members with whom he has grown disenchanted: the absence of consensus picks to replace them; concern that their nominated successors may not get confirmed in the divided Senate; and reluctance to pick allied senators or House members for fear of losing Republican seats in special elections, as happened last year in Alabama. Also, Trump has sometimes expressed confusion about what agencies and secretaries are in charge of what duties, a senior administration official said. For example, this official said, he has complained to Pruitt about regulatory processes for construction projects, although the EPA is not in charge of the regulations. Amid the disarray, White House staff are training Cabinet secretaries and their staffs on ethics rules and discussing new processes to prevent mistakes. William McGinley, who runs the White House Office of Cabinet Affairs, and Stefan Passantino, a deputy White House counsel, have met individually and in groups with Carson, Pruitt, Shulkin, Zinke and other Cabinet secretaries to impress upon them the importance of changing behavior. Simply following the letter of the law is not enough, administration officials said. Trump and Kelly demand that their Cabinet secretaries be mindful of political optics and the bad headlines that come with misbehavior. \"Even if the legal guys sign off on it,\" one official said, \"you still step back and say, \\'Does this make sense optically?\\'\"  The Washington Post\\'s Greg Jaffe contributed to this report. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   A former Playboy model recalled having sex with Donald Trump dozens of times in the early years of the president’s marriage to Melania Trump, sharing elaborate details of what she described as a 10-month love affair. Karen McDougal, the magazine’s 1998 Playmate of the Year, told CNN Thursday that she was racked with guilt about Trump cheating on his wife, especially when he took her on a tour of the couple’s Trump Tower penthouse apartment when Melania was not home. “That just puts a little stab in your heart,” McDougal told Anderson Cooper. “I couldn’t wait to get out of the apartment, actually.” McDougal, who remembered Trump showing her his wife’s private bedroom, apologized to the first lady. “What can you say except I’m sorry?” she said. “I’m sorry. I wouldn’t want it done to me.” McDougal, 46, said Trump flirted with her when they met in 2006 at a Playboy Mansion party celebrating the taping of an “Apprentice” episode there. He asked for her phone number, then invited her to meet for dinner a week later at the Beverly Hills Hotel, she said. His bodyguard, Keith Schiller, picked her up and drove her to the hotel, where after a pleasant dinner in his bungalow McDougal had sex with Trump, she told CNN. Trump, she said, offered her money at the end of the evening, but she turned him down and told him, “I’m not that kind of girl.” She recalled feeling deeply hurt. “I was crying in the back seat of the car,” she said of the ride home with Schiller. But she and Trump fell in love and wound up seeing each other at least five times a month until she broke up with him in April 2007, McDougal said. “If he weren’t married, I wouldn’t have any regrets,” she said. McDougal teared up a few times but mostly kept a calm, poised demeanor during the lengthy interview. She said she was a Republican who voted for Trump. She spoke out as Trump’s alleged marital infidelity and sexual misconduct toward women are becoming a source of growing trouble for the president. Stripper and porn actress Stormy Daniels, who says she had a fling with Trump around the same time as McDougal, will appear Sunday on CBS to share her story on “60 Minutes.” Like Daniels, McDougal recalled that Trump always had unprotected sex.   Stormy weather, or how a meeting at a golf resort blew up into a Trump scandal »   McDougal, who described Trump as nice-looking, funny and respectful, said she was unaware that he might have been having another affair while they were together. In retrospect, she added, “If he’s doing it behind his wife’s back, why wouldn’t he do it behind my back?” The spectacle of a president’s alleged mistresses telling all on prime-time television is reminiscent of the Bill Clinton dramas of the 1990s. With both McDougal and Daniels suing to break confidentiality agreements that they say are shams, the wrangling in court could take years to play out. Trump spokeswomen have denied he had sex with McDougal or Daniels. On Thursday, the first lady tweeted a photograph of herself with the president, smiling on a White House patio with the snow-covered South Lawn as their backdrop. Trump retweeted the photo for his 49 million followers. It was as close as the president would get to responding to the growing public relations mess of multiple sex scandals. “Having them together in these photogenic moments is important,” said political scientist Terry Madonna of Pennsylvania’s Franklin & Marshall College. McDougal, now an Arizona actress and fitness model, filed suit Tuesday in Los Angeles to break the confidentiality agreement that has barred her from speaking publicly about her alleged affair with Trump. American Media Inc., the parent company of the National Enquirer, paid McDougal $150,000 in August 2016 for exclusive rights to the story of what she describes as a 10-month romance with Trump that started in 2006. AMI, led by Trump’s close friend David Pecker, declined to publish the story. Pecker told the New Yorker last year that when AMI bought the rights to McDougal’s story under a contract that also promised her monthly columns and her photo on magazine covers, “she can’t be bashing Trump.” “The guy’s a personal friend of mine,” Pecker said. McDougal said the contract, when she signed it, seemed like a “win-win” for her — protection from the loss of privacy if the affair were exposed and, at the same time, a good business opportunity for an older model. In the suit, however, she alleges that her attorney at the time, Keith Davidson of Beverly Hills, was secretly colluding with Trump representatives to protect the newly named Republican presidential nominee from public disclosure of his extramarital affair.    (Alex Brandon / Associated Press )    AMI, she says, threatened her with financial ruin if she told the truth about Trump. McDougal told CNN that she is suing to escape from such threats and regain the rights to her own story — not to make money on it, but to return to private life. AMI has denied threatening McDougal, saying in a statement Wednesday that it had not yet decided “if, when, or how her story may be published.” “The story is more valuable today than it was two years ago,” the statement said. McDougal is free to “respond to legitimate press inquiries concerning her relationship with” Trump, the company said. The only thing she can’t do is sell her story rights to another publisher, AMI said. McDougal’s attorney, Peter K. Stris, said she “was explicitly told that they would not produce a story on her relationship with Trump.” “Despite their claims, it has always been AMI’s intention to manipulate and silence Karen, and we look forward to freeing her from this bogus contract so she can move on with her life in peace,” he said. McDougal’s deal with AMI was revealed by the Wall Street Journal three days before the November 2016 presidential election. In February, the New Yorker published excerpts from eight pages of handwritten notes that McDougal kept to document her alleged affair with the president. Also suing Trump is former “Apprentice” contestant Summer Zervos. Trump called her a liar after she accused him in October 2016 of trying to force himself on her in 2007, sparking her defamation complaint. On Tuesday, a judge rejected Trump’s request to dismiss it.     michael.finnegan@latimes.com        Twitter: @finneganLAT       UPDATES:   March 23, 8 a.m.: This article was updated to note Wall Street Journal and New Yorker articles on Karen McDougal.  8:50 p.m.: This article was updated with more details from the CNN interview with Karen McDougal.  7:35 p.m.: This article was updated with additional quotes from Karen McDougal.  The article was originally published at 6:45 p.m. March 22.   \\nPresident Donald Trump invited a porn star to join him in a bisexual threesome, it has been alleged.\\nTrump has consistently worked to undermine and destroy protections for LGBT people since becoming President last year.\\nAmong many hateful acts, he has tried to ban trans people from the military, appointed an anti-LGBT Supreme Court justice and endorsed a Republican who wants to make gay sex illegal. \\n   (Getty) \\nHe has also nominated an Army Secretary who said trans people were diseased, proposed slashing HIV AIDS funding and signed an order permitting anti-LGBT discrimination at work. \\nYou get the picture: the man who held a Pride flag with “LGBT for TRUMP” during the campaign has revealed that in reality, he is massively anti-LGBT, in addition to his racism and misogyny.\\n   (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) \\nDespite his many homophobic stances, he allegedly wanted to be involved in a bisexual threesome, according to The Daily Beast. \\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen had arranged for $130,000 in hush money to be sent to porn star Stormy Daniels a month before the 2016 election.\\n\\n    THE MORNING PLUM:  Newly leaked audio has emerged that captures President Trump boasting about his ability to make up information for sport in a private conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\\xa0To put it mildly, it is unsettling to reflect on what this tells us about Trump’s\\xa0approach\\xa0to\\xa0important domestic policy issues and international alliances.  But let’s put that aside for the moment. This revelation is also remarkable because of its exquisite timing: It comes just as Trump and his lawyers are preparing for the likelihood of an extended Trump interview with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Even more exquisitely, Trump’s lawyers are worried about his tendency to … make up information for sport.   “Trudeau came to see me. He’s a good guy, Justin. He said, ‘No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,’ ” Trump said, mimicking Trudeau, according to audio of the private event in\\xa0Missouri obtained by The Washington Post. “Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in — ‘Donald, we have no trade deficit.’ He’s very proud because everybody else, you know, we’re getting killed. “… So, he’s proud. I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know.\\xa0… I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid. … And I thought they were smart. I said, ‘You’re wrong, Justin.’ He said, ‘Nope, we have no trade deficit.’ I said, ‘Well, in that case, I feel differently,’ I said, ‘but I don’t believe it.’\\xa0”   We actually have a trade surplus. Now, for all we know, Trump is lying about having boasted about his ability to lie. But still, this provides one of the most unvarnished looks at Trump’s view of his relationship with the truth that we have yet seen.   Follow\\xa0Greg Sargent\\'s opinionsFollow  As such, it is almost eerily precise in demonstrating the very tendency that Trump’s lawyers are so worried about as they prepare for him to face Mueller. As we have\\xa0already learned, they fret\\xa0about the prospect of an extended, open-ended interview, because of his history of prolific self-contradiction and unprecedented, serial lying.    Trump is acting macho by saying he\\'ll testify under oath in the Russia probe, says Ruth Marcus. Won\\'t the real test come down to whether he tells the truth? (Video: The Washington Post)    Today Politico adds more reporting on this front, noting that Trump’s lawyers face a major challenge — getting Trump to prepare for the Mueller interview. They may run mock sessions to prepare him, Politico notes, but Trump “resists following scripts” and “has deep trust in his own improvisational instincts”:   Trump is not known for studious preparation. He is an impatient reader and spent little time preparing for the 2016 presidential debates. That raises the question of how challenging it might be for his lawyers to ready him for a high-stakes session with Mueller and his crack team of prosecutors.   Trump plainly views the act of lying, or making things up, or contradicting himself with relentless abandon, as an assertion of power — that is, the power to render reality irrelevant, the power to roll right over constraints\\xa0normally imposed by expectations of consistency\\xa0or fealty to basic norms of reasoned, factual inquiry. As Jacob T. Levy has written, these “demonstrations of power undermine the existence of shared belief in truth and facts.”\\xa0The whole point of them is to assert the power to say what the truth is, or what the truth should be, even when — or especially when — easily verifiable facts dictate the contrary. The brazenness of Trump’s lying is not a mere byproduct of his desire to mislead. It is absolutely central to the whole project of declaring the power to say what reality is. Trump’s boast about making stuff up in his meeting with Trudeau comes close to an open admission of this. He lied, or made stuff up, because he could, yes, but also because what one wants to be true actually can be made true. Trump’s lawyers want us to believe they fear a Mueller “perjury trap,” i.e., that Mueller will bait Trump into lying by accident about something relatively trivial. But it’s far more likely that they fear Trump has good reason to lie about something very important — to cover up serious misconduct. After these new comments about Trudeau, perhaps they should be a lot more worried that Trump — who already sees the Mueller probe as a major affront at best and as illegitimate at worst — will discard whatever coaching they give him to evade tough questions about that misconduct, and will instead put his instinctual trust in his power to declare what’s true by brute rhetorical force. That is, by lying.   Few seemed willing to come to grips with how much Mr. Trump is energizing Democrats and turning off independent voters. Some of them even argued that Mr. [Rick] Saccone had managed to make the race close only thanks to the\\xa0president’s rally in the district\\xa0on Saturday. “The president came in and helped close this race and got it to where it is right now,” said Mr. Ryan.   Other Republicans said they can’t run from the president,\\xa0because it will alienate conservative voters. The Trump trap!   Congressional Republicans are … aware that, among the conservative Republican base, Mr. Trump is more popular than they are.\\xa0 … Republicans have also continued to shy away from talk of the president’s personal conduct and management of the White House. … party leaders express little enthusiasm for directly taking on Mr. Trump even though they worry the new tariffs could roil the economy and undermine what they see as their best argument for re-election: tax cuts.   Republicans won’t take on Trump over the tariffs even though they think they’ll hurt the economy, because they are even less popular than he is and it would make conservative voters mad.   * A HUGE SWING AGAINST TRUMP: The analysts at Sabato’s Crystal Ball look at Conor Lamb’s apparent victory and tally up the average swing toward Democrats, relative to what happened under previous presidents:    Lamb’s apparent victory margin of 0.3 points in Tuesday’s special election equaled a swing of 22.8 points toward Democrats relative to the district’s 2016 lean. The average swing for the GOP in U.S. House specials during President Donald Trump’s tenure is -13.7 points and the median swing is -18.4 points. These marks are worse than every modern president save Gerald Ford.   It’s another way in which Trump is besting so many of his predecessors. Meanwhile, Republicans can’t run from Trump, either.  * BANK BILL EXPOSES DEMOCRATIC SCHISM: The Senate passed a bank deregulation bill late yesterday that Democrats Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown claim is a giveaway to Wall Street.\\xa0Demcrats from Trump states supported it:   For the first time since Trump became president, the divisions lurking within the Senate Democratic Caucus burst into full view …\\xa0the debate highlighted how the political imperatives for red-state Democrats can collide with those of liberals such as Warren, who’s seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2020, creating the potential for conflict that could flare anew in future.   It’s odd that Democrats think they need to support this bill to win reelection in states that economic populist Trump won by appealing to anger at economic elites.  *GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES SPEND AT TRUMP PROPERTIES: CNN scoops:   Defense Department employees charged just over $138,000 at Trump branded properties in the first eight months of Donald Trump’s presidency, according to a CNN review of hundreds of records. Charges on the department-issued Visa cards, which span from Honolulu to Washington, DC, are the most recent evidence that taxpayer money flows to Trump’s company.   This all goes back to Trump’s refusal to divest. And because he won’t release his tax returns, we’ll never know the full extent of his profiting off the presidency.  * OIL LOBBYISTS SPEND AT TRUMP HOTEL: Politico scoops:   The oil industry’s top lobby group is holding a two-day board meeting at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., before its executive committee goes to the White House to voice concerns about President Donald Trump’s proposed steel tariffs … The … meeting … could involve up to 200 people representing various oil and gas companies … paying to stay at Trump’s hotel.   Anyone else noticing a pattern here? Good thing congressional Republicans are exercising robust oversight.   * AND MULTIPLE OFFICIALS ARE MIRED IN ETHICS MESSES: The Post steps back and sums up the big picture:    At least a half-dozen current or former Trump Cabinet officials have been mired in federal investigations over everything from\\xa0high-end travel\\xa0and spending on items such as a\\xa0soundproof phone booth\\xa0to the role of family members\\xa0weighing in\\xa0on official business. …\\xa0Revelations about repeated use of\\xa0chartered airplanes\\xa0forced the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price … Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin has continued to\\xa0wrestle with the fallout\\xa0of news that taxpayers covered the expenses for his wife during a 10-day trip to Europe last year.   Swamp, drained?   Reporting from San Diego\\xa0—\\xa0 President Trump saw just what he wanted to see on his first visit to California as president on Tuesday — physical evidence of the “big, beautiful wall” separating the United States and Mexico that was the central promise of his campaign — yet steered clear of the resistance to his presidency that has come to define the state. Standing amid cement-and-steel prototypes at the Mexican border, Trump had harsh words for the state’s Democratic officeholders who oppose the wall as well as his other anti-immigration policies. Protesters, including deported veterans on the Tijuana side, were kept mostly out of sight. The president accused Gov. Jerry Brown of “doing a terrible job running the state,” said residents would begin fleeing California to avoid its high taxes, vowed to beat the state in court and in Congress over its so-called immigrant sanctuary laws and insisted that he would build a new, bigger wall. “For the people that say, ‘No wall,’ if you didn’t have walls over here, you wouldn’t even have a country,” Trump said, in a variation of one of his favorite lines. “The border wall is truly our first line of defense.” The president’s overnight trip to California, coming later in his term than for any White House occupant since Franklin D. Roosevelt, was brief in duration but long on symbolism as Trump personally confronted the blue state he has clashed with most. The president did not mix with ordinary residents, let alone the many protesters at his San Diego and Los Angeles stops. He spoke to senior Border Patrol officials while inspecting the wall prototypes for about an hour, addressed service members at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and, finally, mingled with deep-pocketed donors at a $5-million campaign fundraiser in the Beverly Park home of Edward Glazer, co-chairman of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The attention Trump wanted to bring to his signature immigration issue was overshadowed, as often happens with administration initiatives, by the president’s own actions — in this case a new round of chaos within his leadership team after the abrupt firing Tuesday of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Trump called Tillerson as Air Force One was flying to California, hours after firing his secretary in a morning tweet. Trump appeared to relish his visit to the border wall prototypes, pointing eagerly to charts and graphics shown to him. “I’m a builder; what I do best is build,” he later told the troops at Miramar. He spoke with border agents about his preference for “see-through” walls, talked about the ugly aesthetics of current barriers and insisted the new versions would block smugglers who have the skills of “professional mountain climbers.” “The ones that work the best aren’t necessarily the most expensive,” he said approvingly. The president has yet to secure from Congress the $25 billion he seeks to build a wall, and it’s not clear whether even that would be enough. One estimate put the cost as high as $100 billion. His campaign promise that Mexico would pay for the wall has been a nonstarter in that country.    1/41  Ian Jameson with the group “Pasadenans and Altadenans Against Police Violence,” shouts at a Trump supporter in Beverly Gardens Park in Beverly Hills Tuesday evening.\\xa0 (Allen J.

Many in the country illegally do not take advantage of government services for fear they will be discovered and deported. Fact checkers have agreed that illegal immigrants add some cost to taxpayers but have called Trump’s claim that the cost exceeds $100 billion mostly false. Trump also insisted again Tuesday that California political leaders actually want walls, despite what they say publicly in opposition. “The state of California is begging us to build walls in certain areas. They don’t tell you that,” he said. That was hardly the only shot he took at state leaders and their policies, especially the “sanctuary” laws that are the subject of a new administration lawsuit. He said the laws limiting local government cooperation with federal immigration enforcement officers are “the best friend of the criminal … the smugglers, the traffickers, the gang members. They’re all taking refuge.” Trump’s comments came a day after the spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s San Francisco office, James Schwab, announced he was resigning because of what he said were false claims by administration officials about the purported security threat from immigrants in the country illegally. Schwab said officials inflated the number of suspected criminals that they said eluded capture in recent California raids because of warnings from Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, whom Trump lambasted again in San Diego. The president singled out Schaaf for criticism, as he has in recent days, but he reserved special criticism for Brown, even as he called him a “nice guy.” “Gov. Brown does a very poor job running California,” Trump said. “They have the highest taxes in the United States. The place is totally out of control. You have sanctuary cities where you have criminals living.” Noting that he owns property in the state, Trump said, “The taxes are way, way out of whack, and people are going to start to move pretty soon.” Brown tweeted in response to Trump’s Twitter account: “Thanks for the shout-out, @realDonaldTrump. But bridges are still better than walls. And California remains the 6th largest economy in the world and the most prosperous state in America. #Facts.” Trump’s visit brought him to the home turf of the resistance movement against his presidency. Immigrant, labor and LGBTQ rights activists planned protests in multiple cities. A few dozen were near the wall site when he arrived, one holding a sign saying, “No Wall, No Hate, No Trump.” Protesters included some deported veterans of U.S. military service, who shouted from the Mexican side of the border, out of Trump’s sight. “We just want a few minutes with the president. He’s our commander-in-chief,” said Hector Lopez, a former resident of Madera who said he served six years in the U.S. Army Reserve. Lopez said the veterans want Trump to give them legal status to return to the United States. Many Republican candidates kept their distance from Trump on Tuesday, given his low popularity in the state. Rep. Darrell Issa, the Vista Republican who is not seeking reelection, was an exception. Greeting Trump at the Marine base, he gave the president a green baseball cap that said, “Make the Hornet Great Again,” a reference to the F/A-18 aircraft of that name, one of which was parked nearby. Fellow GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter of Alpine joined Trump while he examined wall prototypes. Democratic politicians in the state, meanwhile, issued denunciations of Trump. Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a front-runner in the governor’s race, released an online animated video caricaturing the president and his immigration policies. One image showed Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan reimagined as “Make America White Again.” “It’s official: Donald Trump finally worked up the nerve to visit California, bringing his fear-of-everything agenda with him,” Newsom said in a voiceover. “Let’s get real. Donald Trump’s border wall is a monument to idiocy. A 1,900-mile waste of taxpayer money that — news flash — is impossible to complete.” The political action committee for Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who is considering a run for president, ran ads coinciding with Trump’s arrival. In a fundraising email, Garcetti wrote, “There’s one thing you need to know: California Republicans and Donald Trump are like peas in a pod.” Trump will leave California on Wednesday for events in St. Louis before returning to Washington. As a candidate, Trump boasted that he could become the first GOP presidential hopeful to win California in nearly three decades. He wound up losing to Hillary Clinton in the state by 4.3 million votes, leading to a loss in the nationwide popular vote that Trump often laments. In California, just 22% of voters approved of the job he was doing as president in a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll in November; 66% disapproved. In a state so large, that still leaves millions of people eager to see the president clash with Democrats, who control all the levers of political power.

His arrogance is going to cost this country valuable allies, and it is past time for his supporters to wake up and realize the damage that this man is causing to this country. Ring of Fire’s Farron Cousins discusses this.\\n \\nTranscript:\\nAt a fundraising dinner on Wednesday evening Donald Trump bragged to his would be donors about he just likes to make up facts especially when he’s meeting with other leaders from around the world. Specifically Trump referred to a meeting he had had recently with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau where Trudeau came into his office, according to Trump and said, “Hey we don’t have a trade deficit. There’s no trade deficit between our two countries.” And Trump said, “Nope, you’re wrong Justin. I like you but you’re wrong.” Trump admitted to the donors in that crowd on Wednesday evening that he just made that up. He didn’t know if that we true or not but he said it anyway because that’s just the kind of guy that he is. Trump then said they sent their staffers out of the room to find out if there was a trade deficit and lo and behold, Justin Trudeau was the one telling the truth.\\nDonald Trump admitted and Washington Post obtained audio of this little fundraising dinner that he had, admitted that he lies to foreign leaders. One of our closest both in terms of relationship and spatial relationships allies and he just lies to him because that’s the kind of piece of crap human being that Donald Trump actually is. And all the Donald Trump supporters out there, let me explain this to you and I’m going to use small words so that you can understand it properly. We have to maintain close, honest relationships with our allies. Why? Well let me take you back to the early 2000s when George W. Bush and his administration manipulated intelligence to launch an Iraq war. He lost American allies. People didn’t want to sign onto his war on terror because they knew that it wasn’t true. We didn’t get their help.\\nThat’s the kind of situation we’re looking at now and I’m not saying we’re going to war but whenever something happens, if we want to make better trade deals, if we do find ourselves in an armed conflict that we need help with, we’re not going to have those people there because we have a president who likes to brag about the fact that he lies and makes shit up to these other world leaders and if you don’t think that that’s a problem then I feel sorry for you. Because you need to understand the kind of damage that this moron is inflicting upon this planet. This is not the way a normal president behaves. There is such a thing as bluffing. You know trying to get a better deal here and there and then there’s outright lying and that is exactly what Donald Trump is doing because that is exactly what Donald Trump admitted to doing.\\n  \\n\\tU.S. President Donald Trump visited Western Pennsylvania on Saturday night to stump for state Rep.

Obamajams made way for “Make America Late Again” on Tuesday, as Trump paid his first visit to California — a rogue state in his eyes — since he won the election in 2016. It was a trip that brought out his most ardent lovers and haters, with enough law enforcement and barricades to keep them from assaulting each other — at least as of Tuesday evening. At the Marine Corps Air Station in Miramar, he elicited laughs and applause as he ripped the media and proposed a new “Space Force” to wage war in space. In the Los Angeles area, he was met with vitriolic protest signs and all manner of ridicule, such as “Chicken Don,” an inflatable chicken with orange hair meant to mock him as a coward. When Marine One landed at Santa Monica airport, people flipped the middle finger at the helicopter or chanted “no Trump, no KKK, no Fascist USA!” For many demonstrators, this was the first time they could register their anger directly at him.    1/41  Ian Jameson with the group “Pasadenans and Altadenans Against Police Violence,” shouts at a Trump supporter in Beverly Gardens Park in Beverly Hills Tuesday evening.\\xa0 (Allen J.

Carlos Jimenez brought his 4-year-old son to the airport just to see a president. “Regardless of political party, it’s still the president,” Jimenez said. “It’s an experience.” In a deep blue part of a blue county, that was about as much support as could be found. Susan Diamond, 49, wanted to show her 12-year-old son that free speech is important. “We came to protest and show him that our values are different from this president,” she said. Her son was more taken with Marine One. “I like the way they take off,” he said. As Trump’s motorcade sped off to a $35,000-minimum fundraiser in Beverly Park, dozens of protesters lined the streets. At the intersection of Bundy Drive and Ocean Park Boulevard, Will Kozicki was walking his two dogs when he stopped to observe demonstrators. “I prefer that Trump was playing golf somewhere rather than coming here,” he said. “But I’m supportive of the protesters,” said Kozicki, who works in finance. “I’m psyched to feel their energy.” Under gray, at times rainy skies, turnout was lighter than expected. The slippery roads during the evening commute only made the traffic worse. Mulholland Drive backed up for miles behind its closure at Coldwater Canyon Avenue. Streets around Beverly Hills came to a standstill, offering sightseers aboard a Starline Tour bus views not just of celebrity homes, but protesters and traffic congestion. Intersections were snarled near downtown, where Trump was expected later at the InterContinental Los Angeles Downtown Hotel in the Wilshire Grand. But that was old hat in the land of Hollywood presidential fundraisers. What was new was his visit to the Mexican border east of San Diego. On Otay Mesa, dozens of Trump supporters gathered early Tuesday about half a mile from the international boundary, where Trump would inspect eight prototypes for the border wall that was his signature campaign promise. “Build that wall! Build that wall!” they chanted. “Trump 2020! Trump 2020!”    (Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times )    They waved American flags and wore red “Make America Great Again” hats. Passing drivers honked and lowered their windows to give a thumbs-up. One man clutched a handmade sign that read, “Assimilate Assimilate Assimilate” in red, white and blue. A woman held a sign depicting bricks that read, “Build the damn wall!” The song “Born in the USA” blared from a loudspeaker. Gregory Brittain, an attorney and member of the Redlands Tea Party Patriots said he worries about the porousness of the border, saying “criminals, terrorists and illegal drugs can still come across.” He put being a Trump supporter in California this way: “It’s kind of like waging guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines.” He said he hopes the turnout of Trump supporters in California — where even a low 26% approval rating accounts for 10 million people — will inspire other conservatives here. “There are so many people out there who think, ‘There’s no one out there who thinks like I do. I hope this sends a message: ‘I can do this, too.’” A small fracas broke out after a protester dropped a Mexican flag from a car. The flag was torn to shreds and a man in a Trump hat and shirt threatened to burn it. “They burn our flag in our country, burn theirs in ours!” another man shouted. Others in the crowd calmed him down, saying it sent the wrong message. To the west, at the border gateway of San Ysidro, dozens gathered Tuesday in a hilltop parking, with a view into Tijuana, to protest Trump and his wall. Fifteen people held up signs with giant letters that spelled: BRIDGES NOT WALLS. Someone else hoisted a sign that read, “Stormy Daniels has a higher approval rating.” Peter Sickels, a retired Episcopalian priest from Ramona, held a 15-foot pole with a Mexican flag waving from the top. He hoped people in Tijuana would see it as symbol of solidarity and friendship. The Rev. Colin Mathewson, a priest at St. Luke’s Episcopal Church in San Diego, said the San Diego border barrier only pushed crossings farther east, into more dangerous mountain areas. “It’s sad because there’s a reason people are coming from Mexico,” he said. “The border wall isn’t going to stop them.” Angelica Godinez, 42, of San Diego, said the fact that Trump didn’t visit California for a year as president and is only coming to look at wall prototypes is a “slap in the face” to citizens and a sign he didn’t come to mend divisions. “He doesn’t come here to talk to our residents, our politicians, our communities. He comes here to see a prototype of a border wall. To me, that is disrespectful to the people that vote, to the citizens of the United States of America.” “California is a model, and I believe that he’s intimidated by that,” she added. After his visits to the border and Marine Corps base, Trump flew to Los Angeles International Airport, then to Santa Monica via helicopter. Hundreds of the protesters gathered in Beverly Hills, several miles from the fundraiser, an event that resembled more of a festival than a protest.    (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times )    Street vendors sold hot dogs, a live band played music and a stage was set up for speakers. Some protesters took advantage of the mud covered areas in the Beverly Gardens Park that formed after the rain and wrote “dump Trump” with the soles of their shoes. It was only Omar Mohamed’s second day in Los Angeles, but he said already felt like he was at home. Born in Tanzania, Mohamed, 37, lived most of his life in Columbus, Ohio, and said that the election of President Trump shocked him. He moved here this week to start a two-month job as a nurse, and seeing hundreds of people vocalize their frustration and anger toward Trump’s policies made him want to stay. “People in my community back in Ohio voted silently, so we were shocked when Trump became president,” he said. A friend from Ohio, Heather Semreen, said she was delighted to see the activism. “This needs to be heard,” she said.

Trump compared her to one of his daughters, Ivanka Trump. “He’s very proud of Ivanka, as he should be. I mean, she’s a brilliant woman. She’s beautiful. That’s his daughter, and he should be proud of her,” she told CNN’s Anderson Cooper in an interview that aired Thursday.  “He said I was beautiful like her, and, you know, ‘You’re a smart girl,’” she said. “And there wasn’t a lot of comparing, but there was some, yeah. I heard a lot about her.” However, McDougal said she didn’t find it weird ― and then made a strange comparison of her own.  “I know a lot of people think it’s odd. But do I think it’s strange that a father would love his daughter so much that he brags about her? No, I brag about my dog that much.” That wasn’t the only eyebrow-raising moment: McDougal also said Trump made her cry after the first time they were intimate.   McDougal, who was Playmate of the Year in 1998, is suing a publisher to get out of an agreement that she says forbids her from talking about her 10-month affair with Trump, which took place about the same time as his alleged relationship with adult film star Stormy Daniels.

New Yorker magazine reported in February that Mr Trump had an affair with Ms McDougal at the same time he was in a relationship with a porn star and the National Enquirer tabloid paid the model $US150,000 to prevent her story being made public.

Ms McDougal said she and Mr Trump had sex dozens of times without using protection after the relationship began in Los Angeles in June 2006, not long after his wife Melania gave birth to their son Barron. She said she met Mr Trump at the Playboy Mansion during filming of Celebrity Apprentice, a TV series in which he starred.  \"I was attracted to him. He\\'s a nice looking man.

CNN showed a picture of Ms McDougal with Mr Trump, Ms Trump, his daughter Ivanka Trump and other Playboy models. She said she met Mr Trump at his golf courses in California and New Jersey and went with him to his family apartment at Trump Tower in New York City, going through a back entrance. Ms McDougal said they also spent time at a resort at Lake Tahoe in California, where adult film actress Stormy Daniels has said she met Mr Trump. Ms Daniels claims that she had an affair with Mr Trump.       Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels, first spoke of an alleged affair with Mr Trump in 2011.(AP: Matt Sayles)   Ms Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, sued the President on March 6, stating that Mr Trump never signed an agreement for her to keep quiet about an \"intimate\" relationship between them. She received $US130,000 under that agreement. Ms McDougal said she broke up with Mr Trump in April 2007. Asked what she would say to Mr Trump\\'s wife, Ms McDougal told CNN: \"I\\'m sorry. I wouldn\\'t want it done to me.\" Ms McDougal filed a suit in California on Tuesday seeking release from the agreement requiring her to stay silent.

An amendment to the U.S. Constitution approved in 1951 limits presidents to two terms in office. In order to change the current prohibition, it would require initial support of two-thirds of both houses of Congress or support of two-thirds of state legislatures - and then would need to be ratified by three-quarters of the states. China\\'s annual parliament gathering kicks off on Monday as Xi presses ahead with efforts to ward off financial risks without undermining the economy. The Communist party announced Feb. 25 the end of the two-term limit for the president—and parliament is expected to ratify the move. The two-term limit was introduced by former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in 1982, and was designed a repeat of dictatorships such as that of Mao Zedong, who ruled China for decades. During the remarks, Trump praised Xi as\"a great gentleman\" and added:\"He\\'s the most powerful (Chinese) president in a hundred years.\" Trump said Xi had treated him\"tremendously well\" during his visit in November. Trump has often praised Xi, but in January Trump told Reuters the United States was considering a big\"fine\" as part of a probe into China\\'s alleged theft of intellectual property. He has been critical of China\\'s trade policies. Trump told The New York Times in December that following the growing threat from North Korea, he had\"been soft on China because the only thing more important to me than trade is war.\" \\n   In a Saturday campaign rally in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Republican president Donald Trump called for the execution of convicted drug dealers. This call came at a rally for a Republican congressional candidate in a district heavily affected by the closure of steel mills and the ravages of a drug epidemic that has claimed the lives of thousands in working-class communities. “Do you think the drug dealers who kill thousands of people during their lifetime, do you think they care who’s on a blue-ribbon committee?” the president rhetorically asked his audience. He continued, “The only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness… I don’t think we should play games.” Trump compared the supposedly lenient drug laws in the United States to the “zero tolerance” laws existing in countries such as Singapore and China, saying “I think it’s a discussion we have to start thinking about. I don\\'t know if we’re ready—I don\\'t know if this country’s ready for it.” Trump made similar comments at a White House summit late last month, presenting the execution of drug traffickers as a means of stemming the opioid epidemic. The Washington Post reported Friday that the White House was considering a new policy to allow prosecutors the right to pursue the death penalty against convicted drug dealers. Trump’s statements come amid a rapidly expanding social crisis, in which over 64,000 Americans lost their lives to a drug overdose in 2016, the last year for which statistics are available. Despite the recommendations of a six-member, bipartisan commission established last March, the Trump administration has produced nothing to address the social devastation which is responsible for the crisis. Instead, the president has relied increasingly on authoritarian and police-state measures. In January, Democratic Representative Patrick Kennedy, a member of Trump’s commission, stated the president’s work on the drug crisis has been a “charade.” But the Democrats have generally gone along with the pretense of action, praising Trump’s declaration of a 90-day “national emergency” even though it was backed by little new funding. The Trump administration’s proposed budget slashes funding for mental health and drug treatment. Rather than supplying funds for drug treatment, counseling and other life-saving measures, the Trump administration has sought to curtail access. In January, Seema Verma, Trump’s administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMMS) unveiled plans to introduce work requirements for low income recipients of Medicaid, which would cut drug treatments for the poor and unemployed. The viciousness of the Trump administration’s pursuit of low-level drug offenders is matched perhaps only by its hypocrisy. In October, Trump was forced to withdraw his nomination of Pennsylvania Republican Representative Tom Marino to head the federal Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) after it was revealed that the congressman had spearheaded efforts to cripple the agency’s ability to regulate the pharmaceutical industry’s dispersal of cheap prescription painkillers. Unsurprisingly, Trump’s recent comments calling for the death of drug peddlers who “kill 5,000 people with drugs ... [and] are making a lot of money” were not a reference to the big-shot criminals, the CEOs and major stockholders of the pharmaceutical manufacturers and distribution companies, but rather to the street-level drug sellers who are the retail minions of the corporate bosses.

The US president applauded Xi Jinping’s bid to usher China back into an era of a one man dictatorship - hailing the world leader as “great” and praising the fact he now holds office “for life”. China’s most powerful leader in a generation, who took power in 2012, had been expected to rule until 2023. However, last week China’s ruling Communist Party proposed removing a constitutional clause limiting presidential service to two consecutive terms, potentially paving the way for China’s authoritarian leader to stay in office indefinitely. Mr Xi will attempt to use an annual meeting of China’s parliament, which starts on Monday morning, to change the Chinese constitution to scrap presidential term limits. The parliament is expected to ratify the move. “He’s now president for life. President for life. And he’s great,” Mr Trump reportedly told Republican donors at a fundraising event at his Mar-a-Lago estate where he hosted Mr Xi last April. “And look, he was able to do that. I think it’s great. Maybe we’ll give that a shot some day,” the US president added, according to CNN which obtained a recording of what it described as an upbeat, jokey speech. Mr Trump also used the closed door remarks to vent his frustrations about his Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton and reiterate his view about \"a rigged system”. He also branded the invasion of Iraq \"the single worst decision ever made”, but called former President George W Bush \"another real genius.”   \\nDonald Trump\\'s first year: in picturesShow all 29  Mr Trump was criticised for praising Mr Xi by Democratic Representative Ro Khanna. He tweeted: “Whether this was a joke or not, talking about being President for life like Xi Jinping is the most un-American sentiment expressed by an American President. George Washington would roll over in his grave.”  US presidents by tradition served a maximum of two four-year terms until President Franklin Roosevelt was elected a record four times beginning in 1932. An amendment to the US Constitution which was approved in 1951 restricted presidents to two terms in office. Mr Trump has frequently praised Mr Xi, whose tenure has been dogged by constant speculation he wants to stay on in office past the customary two five year terms, but has criticised China\\'s trade policies. The US leader’s comments come after the Chinese government banned George Orwell’s dystopian satirical novella Animal Farm and the letter ‘N’ in a wide-ranging online censorship crackdown earlier in the week. Search terms blocked on Sino Weibo, a microblogging site which is China’s equivalent of Twitter, include “disagree”, “personality cult”, “lifelong”, “immortality”, “emigrate”, and “shameless”. It was not immediately obvious why the ostensibly harmless letter ‘N’ had been banned, but some speculated it may either be being used or interpreted as a sign of dissent.

All rights reserved.)   President Trump praised members of the military Tuesday, saying the administration will give them the “largest pay raise in over a decade,” while touting successes around the globe, and even suggesting the creation of a new military branch — the “Space Force.” The president spoke to thousands of military men and women at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, Calif., Tuesday, following his visit to review border wall prototypes. “I have a message for you straight from the heart of the American people, and you know what that is — we support you, we love you and we will always have your back like you have ours,” Trump said, also praising military spouses and families for their service.   “For too long, the men and women of the United States Armed Forces have been asked to do more with less,” Trump said, listing “underinvestment,” deferred modernization and maintenance, old equipment and having “fewer ships than we should, fewer planes than we should, and fewer of you than we should.” “Today I am very proud to report that all of that is changing, and as you have seen, all of that is changing quickly,” Trump said, noting that his administration sees “peace through strength.”   “I said, maybe we need a new force, I was not really serious, but now I’m thinking that’s a great idea. We’re making a Space Force. Tremendous.”\\n — President Trump in California “I’m talking the largest military buildup since Ronald Reagan, and one of the largest buildups in the history of our nation,” Trump said, noting that the proposed military budget would be $716 billion in 2019. “We are investing in the greatest weapon, the most beautiful weapon. Our most brilliant weapon — you.” Trump added that “in 2019 we want to give you your largest pay raise in over a decade. You deserve it. You deserve it.” Trump also briefly mentioned his upcoming talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, noting “we are doing a pretty good job now with Korea.” “Hopefully something very positive will be coming out of it,” Trump said. “We’ll see. We have to be prepared for anything. But I really believe something positive will come out of it. Will be great for Korea, North and South, and this country.”   WHITE HOUSE SAYS MEETING WITH KIM JONG UN WILL NOT HAPPEN WITHOUT \\'CONCRETE\\' ACTIONS BY NORTH KOREA   Trump also touted the administration’s investments in weaponry, and efforts in modernizing nuclear capabilities to be “so far ahead of any other country.” “We are finally going to lead again. Very soon, we’re going to Mars —you wouldn’t be going to Mars if my opponent won. You wouldn’t even be thinking of it,” Trump said, in a swipe at Hillary Clinton. That\\'s when the president went on to introduce his “new national strategy for space.” “Space is a war-fighting domain, just like the land, air and sea,” Trump said. “We may even have a Space Force — we have the Air Force, we’ll have the Space Force, you know, the Army, the Navy.” He added: “I said, maybe we need a new force, I was not really serious, but now I’m thinking that’s a great idea. We’re making a Space Force. Tremendous.” The president noted that astronauts have been “soldiers and sailors,” and said that service members will be “vital” to “ensuring America continues to lead its way into the stars.” The president pivoted from space, back to land, and applauded the coalition to defeat ISIS. “We took off the gloves – in one year we did more damage to ISIS than the other administration — a certain other administration — did in many years,” Trump said, noting that the coalition has now “liberated almost 100%” of ISIS territory. “You did a great job, you did a great job. ISIS never thought this would happen.”   PINK SLIPS AND PROMOTIONS FLY AT WHITE HOUSE IN CHAOTIC DAY OF TURNOVER   The president\\'s speech comes after a tumultuous day for the administration. Trump fired his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Twitter Tuesday morning, nominating CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace him, and career CIA official Gina Haspel to replace Pompeo.       Trump’s allergy to the written word and his reliance on oral communication have proven liabilities in office.      Brendan McDermid / Reuters      Ironically, it was the publication of a book this week that crystallized the reality of just how little Donald Trump reads. While, like many of the tendencies described in Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury , Trump’s indifference to the printed word has been apparent for some time, the depth and implications of Trump’s strong preference for oral communication over the written word demand closer examination. “He didn’t process information in any conventional sense,” Wolff writes. “He didn’t read. He didn’t really even skim. Some believed that for all practical purposes he was no more than semi-\\xadliterate.”  Recommended Reading       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     Wolff quotes economic adviser Gary Cohn writing in an email: “It’s worse than you can imagine … Trump won’t read anything—not one-page memos, not the brief policy papers, nothing. He gets up halfway through meetings with world leaders because he is bored.” While Trump and his allies, as well as some mainstream journalists, have attacked the accuracy of Wolff’s book, Trump’s allergy to reading is among the most fully corroborated assertions Fire and Fury makes. Ahead of the election, the editors of this magazine wrote that the Republican candidate “appears not to read.” Before the inauguration, Trump told  Axios , “I like bullets or I like as little as possible. I don’t need, you know, 200-page reports on something that can be handled on a page. That I can tell you.” In February, The New York Times  reported that National Security Council members had been instructed to keep policy papers to a single page and include lots of graphics and maps. Mother Jones  reviewed classified information indicating Trump’s briefings were a quarter as long as Barack Obama’s. In March, Reuters reported that briefers had strategically placed the president’s name in as many paragraphs of briefing documents as possible so as to attract his fickle attention. In September, the Associated Press reported that top aides had decided the president needed a crash course on America’s role in the world and arranged a 90-minute, map-and-chart-heavy lecture at the Pentagon. And amid the hype over Wolff’s book, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough wrote a column Friday saying that in September 2015, he confronted Trump over poor debate performances, saying, “Can you read?” Met with silence, Scarborough pressed again: “I’m serious, Donald. Do you read? If someone wrote you a one-page paper on a policy, could you read it?” Trump replied by brandishing a Bible from his mother and saying he read it all the time—probably a self-aware joke, given Trump’s proud impiety and displayed ignorance of the Bible.

There was no grand entry, or at least I missed it, standing behind Secret Service agents awaiting his arrival. Still, the hotel inside — the InterContinental Los Angeles Downtown — had all the charming excesses that our 45th president might desire.  \\n For the record:\\n 12:55 p.m. March 14, 2018An earlier version of this story stated that President Trump entered the Wilshire Grand on 7th Street. He actually used the Francisco Street entrance. \\n The building’s interior decorator told this to my colleague Thomas Curwen about his inspiration for the steakhouse: “We wanted French opulence and good taste to meet with a gritty California scene.” That same spot — La Boucherie — has a bar in the shape of Marie Antoinette’s slipper.    (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles TImes )    But as I set out to spend a night with Donald, I wanted to dig deeper. Trump isn’t just the leader of the free world. He’s a hotelier connoisseur — infamous for dwelling over the smallest details at his properties. So why, I wondered, of all the hotels in our fair city did he decide on this one? It was neither convenient nor a place he had stayed before. The president once wined and dined porn actress Stormy Daniels in a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel, according to Daniels. And, in choosing this fine establishment, he also exposed himself to a rush-hour commute from Beverly Hills — where he had been raising big bucks Tuesday evening. (Yes, this journey is made easier when streets can be closed on his account.) A phalanx of Secret Service and LAPD officers surrounded the building with gates and checkpoints transforming this tower into a fortress. They scanned my bags and hustled me through a metal detector. But when I checked in around 3:30 p.m. in the 70th-floor hotel lobby, high in the clouds, there was no outward indication that this day was any different. I stared out the floor-to-ceiling windows alongside Paul Saxton — a retired New Yorker who was tagging along on his wife’s business trip. A dense fog gave way to an angelic sunset and a picturesque view of the Hollywood sign.    A visitor looks out over downtown Los Angeles from the the 70th floor of the InterContinental hotel. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times )    “It’s the highest hotel on the West Coast,” Saxton told me. “He must like that.” Then, as Trump hobnobbed in Beverly Hills and snarled traffic, I wandered this recently opened colossus. On the seventh floor, I met Davis, 13, and Mila, 9, who had the pool to themselves and were unfazed by the crush of sirens and helicopters overhead. They didn’t care about the rain either — even if it made the pool kind of cold. Their father, Moses Luevano, sat in the hot tub nearby, on his phone as the kids splashed each other and swam laps. Luevano told me he voted for Trump and was pleased with the tax cut the president enacted, but was turned off by the “personal stuff.” He also told me his InterContinental rewards card meant the family always gets upgraded to a suite when they travel. This one was on the 64th floor, he said, and the views were great. So it made sense to him that Trump would want to stay here as well. “He’s staying in the newest, biggest, tallest hotel in Los Angeles. He has to sit on the top of the tower.” Later in the evening, business executives mingled at the Lobby Lounge, where a burger costs $29. Out the windows, the city had taken on a “Blade Runner” vibe and was really glowing. A convention about intellectual property was taking place in the hotel, and attendees relaxed with adult beverages. I overheard excited conversations about Trump and how his stay affected the days of hotelgoers. Still, I never caught a glimpse of El Jefe or any of his recognizable cadre — just a multitude of armed suits ambling around outside the building. At the bar, Giuseppe Van Oordt nursed a $17 old-fashioned. The 32-year-old had only recently moved to downtown Los Angeles, and his friend had snuck him in that evening. He marveled at the vibrancy of the area and said Trump must have felt that energy as well. “It’s the tallest building,” Van Oordt told me. “He’s not going to stay at some second-tallest building.” The hotel’s 2,500-square-foot presidential suite sits on the 66th floor, and the “sweeping views of the Los Angeles skyline serve as the backdrop to a relaxing lounge complete with a piano,” according to the hotel’s website. I’m not sure if Trump stayed in that suite — or if he can tickle the ivories. But with its LED light shows and a display resembling a curved sail affixed to the top, the building is as Trumpian as you can get in this city — albeit with less gold and more glass.    (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles TImes )    Tammy Jow of AC Martin architects was one of the lead designers of the building. She worked for years with its owner, Yang Ho Cho, the chairman of Hanjin International Corp. and Korean Air, and his daughter Heather Cho to create something special. “I think it’s an honor,” Jow told me upon hearing Trump would be staying here. “I think it fulfills a vision that the chairman had from the beginning — that we would provide a hotel of a caliber that would be able to host dignitaries, even presidents.” She demurred when I was asked whether it was ironic that Trump was staying at this beacon of Korean wealth in one the country’s most diverse cities even as he spent Tuesday marveling at prototypes for his “big beautiful wall” and spent last week promoting trade tariffs.    (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles TImes )    But Jow’s mention of Yang Ho Cho led me to an equally intriguing theory for why Trump chose this hotel — one that several guests posited to me as well. “It’s the newest five-star hotel or maybe it’s because of the business interests. That Korean money,” said a woman I met who was wearing a black hat with the Jaguar car logo on it and carrying a small terrier. Trump staying here would certainly be a feather in Cho’s cap, said Richard Gowan, a foreign policy expert who has been closely following the crisis on the Korean peninsula. Maybe it will help Trump endear himself to a country whose help he’ll need in any number of upcoming geopolitical crises. “So Trump’s team have to be aware that he can’t lay his head on a pillow anywhere without sending a political message,” Gowan said in an email. “It is rather like the King in some medieval realm announcing that he is coming to stay in some remote baron’s castle. It is a signal of friendship to the host. But the host had better get the details right.” Overwhelmed by the days events, I forgot to close the shades in my room on the 45th floor. So I was roused bright and early by a clear sunrise. The highlight of the room was the softest terrycloth robe I ever did wear. I heard from my colleagues in the office that the president would be leaving around 8:30 a.m. So I stood with my nose pressed against the glass hoping to see the motorcade while contemplating whether to order a $28 omelette. But there was no sign of the motorcade — just a clear view of the parking lot that was the 110 Freeway. Dejected, I trekked back to the 70th-floor lobby, my ears popping as I rode the elevator upward. After checking out, I got one of the few signs that Trump had even been in Los Angeles. From the resplendent lobby, I watched the president’s fleet of helicopters take off from the Dodger Stadium parking lot and make the crosstown journey to LAX. Then Trump was off to Missouri.

We could not have known how impactful this would be for some of our own,” Davis said. “It was a special honor for two of our staff members to have a seat at President Trump’s roundtable discussion.\"\\xa0 Renee Crooker, a faculty services supervisor at College of the Ozarks, used the check to help pay for a plane ticket out of the country to be with her daughter, Erika, when she contracted double viral pneumonia. “When I read the email stating we would receive the bonus, I couldn’t believe that was happening. It came at the perfect time,” Crooker said. “College of the Ozarks is known for being generous towards its students. But I was in awe the decision was made to bless faculty and staff in this way. I don’t know who else would do that.” Bonnie Brazzeal, a cafeteria worker, was overjoyed when she heard the news that her employer, College of the Ozarks, was awarding all employees with a $204 bonus. “To me, that was a blessing from God,” Brazzeal said. “I put the money straight into a savings account for my retirement.”\\xa0 Davis said Brazzeal\\xa0represents Middle America – her hard work and discipline are something worth rewarding. “Bonnie is typical of so many working-class families who are so often forgotten,” Davis said. “What some call crumbs, others call miracles.” “It’s been truly inspirational to see all of you,” Trump said at the end of the roundtable discussion, the release said. “I want to thank everybody for the great statements.... It’s very simple. Make America great again. That’s what we’re going to do. And that’s what we’re doing. And it’s happening a lot faster than anybody thought possible.” Trump greeted Davis, Crooker\\xa0and Brazzeal as he was leaving the venue and followed up with Crooker about her daughter’s health. “I can’t wait to tell my daughter that President Trump asked about her recovery,” Crooker said.

When he saw \"a big guy with a big bat\" bashing another fellow, Donald Trump did what any self-respecting billionaire would do: He ordered his driver to pull over. \"I\\'m not looking to play this thing up,\" Trump said yesterday. \"I\\'m surprised you found out about it.\" Witnesses said Trump, with Marla Maples tugging at his arm to try to stop him, leaped from his black stretch limousine Monday evening during the assault on Ninth Ave. near 45th St.  Brutal-looking  \"Someone in the car looked over and said, \\'Gee, look at that, it\\'s a mugging,\\' \" Trump said. \"I said to my driver to stop the car because it was brutal-looking.\" Trump was at first reluctant to discuss his daredevil deed, but then he warmed to the task. \"The guy with the bat looked at me, and I said, \"Look, you\\'ve gotta stop this. Put down the bat,\"\\' Trump said. \"I guess he recognized me because he said, \\'Mr. Trump, I didn\\'t do anything wrong.\\' I said, \\'How could you not do anything wrong when you\\'re whacking a guy with a bat?\\' Then he ran away.\"    New York Daily News published this on November 20, 1991     Trump said the incident occurred at 8 p.m. as he, Maples and another couple were heading toward the Lincoln Tunnel on their way to the Meadowlands in New Jersey for a Paula Abdul concert.

Kathleen Romeo, a 16-year-old student at St. Michael\\'s Academy in Manhattan, said cries of \"There\\'s Trump!\" went through the crowd of onlookers. \"A lot of people were surprised that he got out to see what was happening,\" Romeo said, adding that the bat-wielder ran off just before Trump actually appeared, and that Trump, \"just looked around and went back into his limo.\" But another witness, who asked not to be identified, said. \"There was a guy with a bat, hitting a guy over the head, and Trump yelled, \\'Put that bat down. What are you doing?\\' The guy dropped the bat, came over and started talking to him.\" Trump said the bat-man delivered at least \"five or six good whacks\" before he interceded. Trump said he left the site only after he saw a man who appeared to be a doctor treating the victim and heard that an ambulance was on its way. Police said the attack was not reported to police. The incident may have been a karmic sequel to the Oct. 31 mugging of Trump\\'s mother, whose attacker was chased and caught by bread deliveryman.   WASHINGTON — North Korean state television aired video on Thursday from the historic summit between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that included a surprising moment when the American president saluted a North Korean general. Trump reached out to shake the general\\'s hand, and the general responded with a salute. Trump reciprocated, saluting the general back before the men shook hands. The video is now running over and over on North Korean state television with an enthusiastic anchor track. Social media exploded with outrage about Trump\\'s salute. Retired Army Maj. Gen. Paul Eaton, a senior adviser to the advocacy group VoteVets.org, said, \"It is wholly inappropriate for the commander in chief of our armed forces to salute the military of our adversary, especially one which is responsible for a regime of terror, murder and unspeakable horror against its own people.\" Col. Jack Jacobs, a Medal of Honor recipient and an NBC News analyst, said that the North Korean general\\'s salute was a sign of respect but Trump\\'s salute \"seemed like a reflexive action.\" \"If I had been his military aide I would have told him, \\'They\\'re going to salute you, but don\\'t return the salute, just move smartly down the line.\\'\" Presidential historian Michael Beschloss told NBC News that \"one test of a leader is that he knows what message a public gesture sends. In this case, either he made a mistake or he was trying to send the message that he doesn\\'t take the human rights abuses by the North Korean military as seriously as many other Americans do.\" In the military a salute is a sign of respect, with a junior officer or junior enlisted service member always saluting first. While civilians do not return a salute from a military member, the President is the Commander in Chief and will generally return a salute from U.S. military service members but not military from other nations. In 2009 during his first visit to Japan as president, Barack Obama bowed deeply from the waist when greeting Japanese Emperor Akihito, eliciting criticism from conservatives who said the gesture projected weakness on the world stage. Trump was quick to criticize Obama a few years later when he bowed during a greeting of Saudi King Abdullah in 2012. \"@BarackObama bowed to Saudi king in public — yet the Dems are questioning @MittRomney\\'s diplomatic skills,\" Trump tweeted. A salute is a sacred element of military service and history. U.S. military members are taught the salute originated in Roman times when knights in armor would raise their visors with their right hand when greeting a fellow knight. According to a New York Times story from 2009, Ronald Reagan was thought to be the first president to begin returning salutes regularly. He had sought advice from the commandant of the Marine Corps, who told him that as commander in chief he could salute anyone he liked. In September 2014 Obama saluted with a cup of coffee in his hand, drawing criticism from conservatives and retired military who deemed it the latte salute and displayed it as a evidence that Obama lacked understanding about the military. Asked about the salute by NBC News, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said he hadn’t seen the video, \"so it’s tough for me to comment on that.\" The White House did not immediately respond to an additional request for comment.

The White House on Thursday released results of his most recent physical, revealing that his Body Mass Index is now 30.4. That’s based on the fact that he’s now carrying 243 pounds on his 6-foot, 3-inch frame. That’s up from 236 pounds in September 2016 before he became president. An index rating of 30 is the level at which doctors consider someone obese under this commonly used formula. About 40 percent of Americans are obese, and that raises their risk for heart disease, diabetes, stroke and some forms of cancer. Trump, doesn’t drink alcohol or smoke, but he’s not a big fan of the gym either. His primary form of exercise is golf. And he says he gets plenty of walking in around the White House complex. As for his diet, Trump’s love of fast food remains. Last month, he invited the college football champion Clemson Tigers to the White House during the partial government shutdown. With the White House kitchen too understaffed to cater a meal, Trump stepped in: He ordered burgers, french fries and pizza. Despite gaining four pounds from last year, Dr. Sean Conley, the president’s physician, said the 72-year-old president “remains in very good health overall.” His resting heart rate is 70 beats a minute and his blood pressure reading was 118 over 80, well within the normal range. Conley said routine lab tests were performed and Trump’s liver, kidney and thyroid functions are all normal as were his electrolytes and blood counts. An electrocardiogram, a test that measures electrical activity generated by the heart as it beats, remained unchanged from last year. “Despite the fact that he’s obese, his blood pressure is normal,” said Dr. Mariell Jessup, the Heart Association’s chief science and medical officer. Using the association’s heart risk calculator, “he has a 17 percent chance of developing cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years,” mostly because of his age and slightly elevated bad cholesterol, she said. Modern-day presidents have undergone regular exams to catch any potential problems but also to assure the public that they are fit for office. Trump went to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center last week for his second periodic physical, which lasted about four hours. During his exam, he received a flu shot and an inoculation to help prevent shingles, a viral infection that causes a painful rash. “I performed and supervised the evaluation with a panel of 11 different board-certified specialists,” Conley wrote in a memorandum to the White House. “He did not undergo any procedures requiring sedation or anesthesia.” His cholesterol reading improved since last year. At his physical in January 2018, his total cholesterol was 223, which his higher than recommended, even though he was taking a low dose of the statin drug Crestor to help lower so-called “bad” cholesterol and fats. Last year, his doctor said he would increase that dose in an effort to get Trump’s bad cholesterol reading of 143 down below 120. Now, Trump’s total cholesterol is down to 196, yet his LDL or “bad” cholesterol is 122 – slightly elevated. Conley said he planned to increase the dosage of a statin drug to 40 milligrams a day to bring the president’s cholesterol reading down further. Dr. Robert Eckel, a former American Heart Association president and cardiologist at the University of Colorado, said he would aim for an LDL below 100. “Losing some weight would help modify some of the risk factors for heart disease,” Eckel said. “A 20 to 25-pound weight loss would be what I’d recommend if he were my patient. And that’s not a quick fix.”    President Trump remains in “good health” and has not had any major changes to his health status in the past year, according to a memorandum signed by his doctor and released Thursday by the White House. After gaining four pounds over the past year, Trump is officially considered obese. Sean P. Conley, the physician to the president, said in the memorandum that “there were no findings of significance or changes to report” after Trump underwent a four-hour physical exam that included 11 specialists last week.  “After taking into account all the laboratory results, examinations and specialist recommendations, it is my determination that the President remains in very good health overall,” Conley wrote. The White House released the memorandum, which included basic details about Trump’s health, including his heart rate (70 beats per minute) and his blood pressure (118/80 mmHg). It was the second time the White House has released Trump’s medical information since he took office in 2017. Trump, 72, stands 6-foot-3 and weighs 243 pounds, according to the memorandum. The president’s weight was reported as 239 pounds last year, and he was advised to watch his diet, exercise more and lose weight. Trump’s new weight pushes his body mass index over 30, the threshold for obesity. Trump joins about 40 percent of American adults over age 20 who fit into that category, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Still, Trump’s medical report suggests he is in relatively good health compared with other people his age. Mariell Jessup, chief science and medical officer of the American Heart Association, said the data released by Trump’s physician show a “lucky” older man with relatively low risk for cardiovascular disease. Jessup plugged the data released by Trump’s physician into the American Heart Association’s risk calculator and found that Trump has a 17 percent chance of developing cardiovascular disease in the next decade. “His blood pressure being in the normal range has helped him, and his cholesterol — though not perfect — is quite good,” Jessup said. “I think he is lucky, and it points out what we’ve often said: If you can get to the age of 50 in this country and have no major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, the odds are you will live a long time, free of cardiovascular disease.” Jessup noted that obesity was an important risk factor for diabetes and high blood pressure, but that in the absence of either of those conditions, there was debate about the importance of the obesity threshold in older adults. The only change noted to Trump’s medication regimen was an increase in the dosage of a cholesterol-lowering drug. He also received the shingles vaccine, which has been in shortage for months, and a vaccine against pneumococcal disease. Conley’s language about Trump — “very good health overall”— was less effusive than the language used last year by Trump’s former doctor, Navy Rear Adm. Ronny L. Jackson. Jackson, the White House’s chief medical adviser, described Trump’s overall health as “excellent,” adding that the president had “good genes” and was “very healthy.” Both Jackson and Conley said they expected Trump to remain healthy for the duration of his presidency.     WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has gained weight over the past year and is now in the obese range, although he remains in “very good health overall,” according to results of an annual presidential physical examination conducted last week. Trump, known for his love of hamburgers and well-done steaks and an aversion to the gym, was warned by his doctor last year that he needed to change his diet and start to exercise. But the 72-year-old president weighed in at 243 pounds (110.2 kg), up from 239 pounds (108.4 kg) in early 2018. The added pounds pushed Trump’s body mass index into the obese category, which increases the risk of heart disease and is associated with a higher risk for cancers. “He’s definitely carrying too much weight,” said Dr. Matthew Sorrentino, a preventive cardiologist at the University of Chicago Medicine. Trump’s doctor said the president’s health was fine. “After taking into account all the laboratory results, examinations and specialist recommendations, it is my determination that the president remains in very good health overall,” his physician Sean Conley said.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque    DOCTOR’S ORDERS Last year, Trump’s doctor had directed him to try to lose 10 to 15 pounds (4.5-6.8 kg) by eating better and exercising. While aides said he chose fish over red meat more often during the year, his main source of exercise remained golf. Trump’s resting heart rate was 70 beats per minute (bpm), up from 68 bpm last year. His blood pressure was 118/80 compared to 122/74. “His cholesterol levels are not awful, but somewhat high,” said Dr. Ranit Mishori, a professor of family medicine at Georgetown University School of Medicine. Trump’s doctor said he increased his dose of a statin, a drug to reduce cholesterol. Trump’s total blood cholesterol was 196, down from 223 last year. A breakdown of the president’s cholesterol numbers showed that his high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, the “good” or protective form of cholesterol, was 58, down from 67 last year. His low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the so-called “bad” cholesterol, was 122, down from 143 last year. High LDL levels can lead to a buildup of plaque in the arteries, which can cause a heart attack or stroke. “His LDL is still mildly elevated if you look at averages,” said Sorrentino. Sorrentino said the medication reduces the risk of a heart attack or stroke by “maybe 30 to 40 percent, but it doesn’t eliminate the risk. You still have cardiovascular risk. We’ve just made that a little bit lower by being on a statin.” Trump did not undergo any procedures requiring sedation or anesthesia, his doctor said, meaning he did not have a colonoscopy. The brief memo did not comment on whether Trump had been given a cognitive assessment - the focus of much attention last year, when the White House sought to put to rest questions about his mental fitness for office.  Reporting by Roberta Rampton and Julie Steenhuysen, additional reporting by Tim Ahmann and Steve Holland; editing by Peter Cooney and Bill Berkrot     for-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-up   A New York appellate court ruled Thursday that President Trump must face a defamation lawsuit filed by former “Apprentice” contestant Summer Zervos, one of about a dozen women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct shortly before the 2016 election. The ruling, which Trump’s lawyers plan to appeal, means that attorneys for Zervos may have the opportunity to question Trump under oath in the coming months. The current schedule sets a deadline of June 28 for depositions, with document and electronic discovery expected to be concluded by the end of July.  Trump called Zervos and the other women who made accusations against him “liars,” prompt\\xading Zervos to file the lawsuit in 2017. Trump’s attorneys have tried unsuccessfully to block the suit, arguing that the president is immune from such lawsuits in state court. In its ruling Thursday, a panel of New York appellate judges rejected that argument, citing the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Clinton v. Jones, which established that presidents can be sued for unofficial acts while in office. Two of the five judges on the panel dissented in part. “Contrary to defendant’s contention, Clinton v Jones did not suggest that its reasoning would not apply to state court actions,” the majority decision said. “It merely identified a potential constitutional concern. Notwithstanding that concern, this Court should not be deterred from holding that a state court can exercise jurisdiction over the President as a defendant in a civil lawsuit.” Zervos’s legal team hailed the ruling as an affirmation that Trump “is not above the law.” “The case has proceeded in the trial court, and discovery continues,” Mariann Wang, Zervos’s attorney, said in a statement. “We look forward to proving to a jury that Ms. Zervos told the truth about Defendant’s unwanted sexual groping and holding him accountable for his malicious lies.” Trump’s attorney, Marc E. Kasowitz, said the president plans to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals, “which we expect will agree with the dissent.” “We believe that the well-reasoned dissenting opinion by 2 of the 5 justices, citing the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Clinton v. Jones case, is correct in concluding that the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution bars state courts from hearing cases against the President while he or she is in office,” Kasowitz said in a statement. Zervos has claimed that Trump forcibly kissed and groped her during a December 2007 encounter at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. Trump has denied the allegations. The ruling in Zervos’s case could also hurt the president’s cause in a separate New York lawsuit — this one involving his troubled charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation. The New York attorney general sued Trump last year, alleging “persistently illegal conduct” at the charity he has run for 31 years. Among other allegations, the attorney general said Trump had used his charity’s money to pay legal settlements for his for-profit businesses, to buy expensive portraits of himself, and to serve as an extension of his political campaign in 2016, making donations arranged by campaign staff. Many of the allegations about misconduct at the Trump Foundation were first reported by The Washington Post in 2016. That suit is also filed in New York state court, and Trump’s attorneys had argued that his status as president should exempt him from state suits. In a recent ruling, the judge in the Trump Foundation case said that if the Zervos ruling were to go in Trump’s favor, she would also dismiss the charity lawsuit. Now, the foundation case seems likely to proceed. Neither New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) nor a Trump Foundation attorney immediately responded Thursday to requests for comment. James entered a new legal filing Thursday with what she said were “undisputed” facts about the Trump Foundation. Among them: James said that the foundation’s board, which was legally required to oversee the charity’s spending, had not met since 1999. “The Foundation is little more than an empty shell that functions with no oversight by a board of directors,” James said in the filing. The lawsuit — first filed under James’s predecessor, Barbara Underwood — asks for Trump to pay millions in penalties and restitution and to be barred from serving on the board of any New York charity for 10 years. It seeks shorter-term bans on charity service for Trump’s children Eric, Ivanka and Donald Jr., who were all members of the foundation’s board. Trump has agreed to shutter the foundation and give away its remaining $1 million in assets to other charities, but the details of that settlement have not been announced. The Zervos case is not the only defamation lawsuit Trump has faced as president. Adult-film actress Stormy Daniels had filed a separate suit against Trump, arguing that he defamed her when he suggested that she had lied about being threatened to keep quiet about their alleged past relationship. That lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge in October. Mark Berman, Alice Crites and Elise Viebeck contributed ti this report.        U.S. president uttered the remark in an interview with Breitbart News, which said he was arguing that “the left” plays politics in a “tougher” and more “vicious” manner than the pro-Trump right.    Daniel DaleWashington Bureau Chief Thu., March 14, 20194 min. read Article was updated Mar. 15, 2019    WASHINGTON—U.S. President Donald Trump issued an extraordinary warning to political opponents on Monday, telling a right-wing website that “it would be very bad, very bad” if his supporters in the military, police and a motorcycle group were provoked into getting “tough.”  Trump uttered the remark in an interview with Breitbart News. It came, according to Breitbart, as Trump was arguing that “the left” plays politics in a more “vicious” manner than the pro-Trump right even though “the tough people” are on Trump’s side. “I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump — I have the tough people, but they don’t play it tough — until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad,” Trump said. The quote went largely unnoticed by the U.S. media until the Star tweeted it on Thursday, when it prompted alarm and criticism. “This is how an authoritarian talks. Happening right in front of us,” Brendan Nyhan, a University of Michigan public policy professor who co-founded an initiative monitoring the state of U.S. democracy, said on Twitter. “So Donald Trump is threatening to unleash state violence (cops, military) and extrajudicial violence (bikers) against his political opponents. Cool republic we had. Shame about the new ownership,” tweeted Republican strategist Rick Wilson, a vocal Trump critic.

Is that the ‘certain point?’” Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen, who has been convicted of several crimes, testified to Congress in February: “Given my experience working for Mr. Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020, that there will never be a peaceful transition of power.” Trump made another veiled suggestion of retribution from the military, police and Bikers for Trump at a campaign rally in November. After mocking Antifa protesters as weaklings — “you see these little arms,” he joked — he said, “And then you see the clubs in their hands. You know, they’re tough guys, right. Where are the Bikers for Trump? Where are the police? Where are the military? Where are the ICE? Where are the Border Patrol? No. No. We’ve taken a lot. We’ve taken a lot, folks.” Bikers for Trump, which has more than 300,000 followers on Facebook, is not a criminal biker gang.   Bikers for Trump founder Chris Cox, a chainsaw artist described in one 2017 newspaper profile as “exceedingly polite,” offered in advance of Trump’s inauguration in 2017 to form a “wall of meat” between the president and protesters. He said, though, that he expected a peaceful gathering. While group members have had verbal confrontations with anti-Trump protesters, there have not been reports of major violence. “I think it’s more of a hope than a threat,” liberal MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell tweeted about Trump’s comments. “Trump’s supporters aren’t as bad & violent & criminal as he hopes they are. They peacefully watched President Obama inaugurated twice. They’ll do that again for the next Democrat. Let’s not help him fan his imaginary flame.” Trump met with some of the Bikers for Trump at his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey in August. In November, Cox travelled to Florida and made unfounded allegations of election fraud. In December, Cox and his German shepherd stood outside the courthouse where former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn was to be sentenced for lying to the FBI, with Cox telling Mother Jones magazine he was “here to make sure [Flynn’s] family is not assaulted or intimidated.” Trump also endorsed violence against protesters at some of his rallies in 2016. In August 2016, the Washington Post’s Greg Sargent noted, he used a hinting formulation similar to the one he used with Breitbart — saying it would be “a horrible day” if gun owners were to take action against Hillary Clinton if she tried to take their guns. “Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish, the Second Amendment. By the way, and if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people — maybe there is, I don’t know. But I tell you what, that’ll be a horrible day,” he said then.     Daniel Dale is the Star’s Washington bureau chief. He covers U.S. politics and current affairs.

Mr Trump was receiving a higher dose of medicine to lower his cholesterol levels, his memo said.   Mr Trump weighed 243lb (110kg) in last week\\'s examination, which is up from 239lb in early 2018.   Other doctors noted that his Body Mass Index (BMI) now fell in excess of 30, which is considered clinically obese.   \"It is my determination that the president remains in very good health,\" Dr Conley said in a brief statement issued by the White House after examining the 72-year-old.   The news of his report was released minutes after officials announced Mr Trump would declare a \"national emergency\" at the US-Mexico border in a bid to secure funding for a border wall.   President Trump, who has a common form of heart disease, had previously been asked to lose at least 10lb.   The 6ft 3in (1.9m) US president reportedly favours a diet of fast food and diet sodas, and has long faced questions over his health.   He famously does not drink alcohol, and says he has never done so. He is also a non-smoker.    During his campaign, he produced a letter that said he would be the \"healthiest individual ever elected\", but the doctor named as the author later said Mr Trump had written the letter himself.   Last year, Dr Ronny Jackson said the president had \"incredible genes\" and it was not a matter of concern that he only slept for four or five hours a night because this was \"just his nature\".

The report detailed that the dosage of his anti-cholesterol medicine, Rosuvastatin, had been increased from 10mg to 40mg.      More on this story       WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has put on some pounds and is now officially considered obese. The White House on Thursday released results of his most recent physical, revealing that his Body Mass Index is now 30.4. That\\'s based on the fact that he\\'s now carrying 243 pounds on his 6-foot, 3-inch frame. That\\'s up from 236 pounds in September 2016 before he became president. An index rating of 30 is the level at which doctors consider someone obese under this commonly used formula. About 40 percent of Americans are obese, and that raises their risk for heart disease, diabetes, stroke and some forms of cancer. Trump doesn\\'t drink alcohol or smoke, but he\\'s not a big fan of the gym either. His primary form of exercise is golf. And he says he gets plenty of walking in around the White House complex. As for his diet, Trump\\'s love of fast food remains. Last month, he invited the college football champion Clemson Tigers to the White House during the partial government shutdown. With the White House kitchen too understaffed to cater a meal, Trump stepped in: He ordered burgers, french fries and pizza. Despite gaining four pounds from last year, Dr. Sean Conley, the president\\'s physician, said the 72-year-old president \"remains in very good health overall.\" His resting heart rate is 70 beats a minute and his blood pressure reading was 118 over 80, well within the normal range. Conley said routine lab tests were performed and Trump\\'s liver, kidney and thyroid functions are all normal as were his electrolytes and blood counts. An electrocardiogram, a test that measures electrical activity generated by the heart as it beats, remained unchanged from last year. \"Despite the fact that he\\'s obese, his blood pressure is normal,\" said Dr. Mariell Jessup, the Heart Association\\'s chief science and medical officer. Using the association\\'s heart risk calculator, \"he has a 17 percent chance of developing cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years,\" mostly because of his age and slightly elevated bad cholesterol, she said. Modern-day presidents have undergone regular exams to catch any potential problems but also to assure the public that they are fit for office. Trump went to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center last week for his second periodic physical, which lasted about four hours. During his exam, he received a flu shot and an inoculation to help prevent shingles, a viral infection that causes a painful rash. \"I performed and supervised the evaluation with a panel of 11 different board-certified specialists,\" Conley wrote in a memorandum to the White House. \"He did not undergo any procedures requiring sedation or anesthesia.\" His cholesterol reading improved since last year. At his physical in January 2018, his total cholesterol was 223, which his higher than recommended, even though he was taking a low dose of the statin drug Crestor to help lower so-called \"bad\" cholesterol and fats. Last year, his doctor said he would increase that dose in an effort to get Trump\\'s bad cholesterol reading of 143 down below 120. Now, Trump\\'s total cholesterol is down to 196, yet his LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol is 122 — slightly elevated. Conley said he planned to increase the dosage of a statin drug to 40 milligrams a day to bring the president\\'s cholesterol reading down further. Dr. Robert Eckel, a former American Heart Association president and cardiologist at the University of Colorado, said he would aim for an LDL below 100. \"Losing some weight would help modify some of the risk factors for heart disease,\" Eckel said. \"A 20- to 25-pound weight loss would be what I\\'d recommend if he were my patient. And that\\'s not a quick fix.\"  Chief Medical Writer Marilynn Marchione in Milwaukee contributed to this report.    A court has ruled President Trump is not above the law — again. Three mid-level appeals judges wrote Thursday that President Trump is not immune from a defamation lawsuit filed by former \"Apprentice\" contestant Summer Zervos while he\\'s in the Oval Office. The 3-2 decision by a five-judge panel of the state’s Appellate Division First Department upholds a lower court’s ruling allowing Zervos’s case to proceed. The reality TV star alleges that Trump forced himself on her in two separate encounters in 2007. She charges that Trump smeared her during the 2016 presidential campaign by calling her a liar in search of fame. Trump had argued he did not have to respond to the lawsuit filed in state court while in office. “The current sitting President attempts to shield himself from consequences for his alleged unofficial misconduct by relying upon the constitutional protection of the Presidency. We reject defendant President Trump’s argument,” Judge Diane Renwick wrote for the five-judge panel. “Though he is tasked with significant responsibilities, the President is still a person, and he is not above the law.”    Breaking News   As it happens Get updates on the coronavirus pandemic and other news as it happens with our free breaking news email alerts.  Trump attorney Marc Kasowitz has argued that Clinton v. Jones does not apply to state lawsuits. He vowed to appeal. “We respectfully disagree with the majority decision in the Appellate Division,” Kasowitz said. “We will seek to appeal the majority decision to New York’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, which we expect will agree with the dissent.”      Sign up to our Evening Headlines email for your daily guide to the latest news Sign up to our free US Evening Headlines email     Donald Trump is officially obese, according to a newly released physical exam from the White House which shows that the president now weighs 243 pounds (110kg). Mr Trump underwent an annual physical on Friday, 8 February, at Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre, under the supervision of physician to the president Dr Sean Conley. According to the results revealed Thursday, the president is in “very good health overall,” but his weight has increased by four pounds.  While a small amount, the weight gain was enough to push Mr Trump, who is six-foot-three, from the overweight to obese category on the BMI index. A body mass index of 30 or more is considered obese, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).   \\nPresident Donald Trump life in picturesShow all 16  During the examination, which took \"approximately four hours,\" Mr Trump was seen by 11 specialists. Apart from the weight gain, there were \"no findings of significance or changes to report on his physical exam,\" according to Dr Conley. Last year, Mr Trump\\'s then-physician Dr Ronny Jackson said the results of the president\\'s physical, which revealed that Mr Trump was taking medication to lower cholesterol, showed he was in \"excellent health\".  The truthfulness of the report, which also reported the president had grown an inch, was widely questioned.  At the time, Dr Jackson suggested Mr Trump, who weighed 239 pounds (108kg), would benefit from \"a diet that is lower in fat and carbohydrates and from a routine exercise regimen\".        The president, who is 6 feet, 3 inches tall, now weighs 243, four pounds more than last year, the White House physician said Thursday.         President Donald Trump gives the thumbs-up after returning to the White House following his annual physical exam on Feb. 8, 2019.Carolyn Kaster / AP      Feb. 14, 2019, 10:10 PM UTC    President Donald Trump is in good overall health, although a 4-pound weight gain since last year puts him into the obese category, according to a memo from the White House physician Thursday. The new details on his health come after Trump, 72, underwent four hours of tests at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday for his annual physical. \"After taking into account all the laboratory results, examinations and specialist recommendations, it is my determination that the president remains in very good health overall,\" according to the White House doctor, Sean Conley. Trump, who is 6 feet, 3 inches tall, weighs 243 pounds, the memo said. That put his body-mass index at 30.4 and anything greater than 30 is considered \"obese,\" according to the National Institutes of Health. In 2018, Trump came in at 239 pounds, which put his BMI at 29.9 and in the \"overweight\" category. The president does not smoke or drink, but famously enjoys fast food. The president\\'s other vital signs this year were normal, and his total cholesterol was down from 223 to 196. The decline is likely due to an increase in his cholesterol medication from 10 mg to 40 mg, NBC medical analyst Dr. Shamard Charles said.        David K. Li    David K.

Officials told The Post that Trump had assumed the role of aviation expert in the past few days, giving his opinion on various aircraft. Trump said he would not have bought a 737 for the small airline he ran, Trump Shuttle, from 1989 to 1992, officials told The Post.  The Federal Aviation Administration had held out on grounding the aircraft after other countries had done so. But investigators uncovered new evidence at the crash site of the Ethiopian Airlines disaster that killed all 157 people onboard on Sunday. Dan Elwell, acting administrator at the FAA, said: \"It became clear to all parties that the track of the Ethiopian Airlines [flight] was very close and behaved very similarly to the Lion Air flight,\" referring to the same model of plane that crashed five months ago in Indonesia, killing all onboard.    \\nAn American Airlines Boeing 737 Max sits at the gate at LaGuardia airport on March 13, in New York.

Washington, United States:   President Donald Trump is a little heavier than last year and needs a higher dose of cholesterol medicine, but remains in \"very good health,\" his official doctor said Thursday. The presidential physician, Sean Conley, said Trump, 72, passed his medical exam last week with flying colors. \"It is my determination that the president remains in very good health overall,\" he said in a brief statement. Trump, who has confounded health experts with his penchant for junk food and avoidance of strenuous exercise, weighs 243 pounds (110 kg), the report said. This is a little bulkier than the 239 pounds recorded last year, which was already considered too much. The resting heart rate has gone up too at 70 beats a minute, compared to 68 beats last year. Trump has a history of high cholesterol and this year the dosage of his anti-cholesterol medicine Rosuvastatin was raised from a low 10mg a day to 40mg, Conley said. \"There were no findings of significance or changes to report on his physical exam, including the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, teeth/gums, heart, lungs, skin, gastrointestinal, and neurologic systems,\" Conley\\'s medical summary said. Trump may have an unhealthy lifestyle and a stressful job, but on the plus side he doesn\\'t smoke and is a noted teetotaler. He says he\\'s never even had a beer. Trump has described his chief exercise as walking around the White House compound and standing up at public events. A slightly more active pastime is his beloved golf.

OK?” Trump said in an interview with Breitbart News published Wednesday. “I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump – I have the tough people, but they don’t play it tough – until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.”\\n \\n \\n He added that “the left plays it cuter and tougher. Like with all the nonsense that they do in Congress.”\\n \\n \\n Several Democrats interpreted the comments as a threat.\\n \\n \\n “I interpret that kind of comment as a danger to peaceful transition of power in our democracy,” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CNN’s “New Day” on Friday.\\n \\n \\n In a CNN op-ed, former White House press secretary for President Bill Clinton Joe Lockhart called Trump’s remark a “thuggish threat of violence against his critics” and a continuation of Trump’s “all-out assault on the basis of our democracy.”\\n \\n \\n Asked about Trump’s comment, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told CNN’s Chris Cuomo Thursday night that the President “didn’t threaten any kind of violence.” \\n \\n \\n “You’re just reading into it like you usually do. You have to read the entire interview,” she said. “He was talking about how peaceful and gentle many people are who are otherwise tough.”\\n \\n \\n Conway then pointed to Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters’ comments encouraging supporters to publicly confront Trump administration officials and former Vice President Joe Biden’s remark that if he and Trump were still in high school, he’d like to “take him behind the gym” in response to Trump’s lewd comments about women in the infamous “Access Hollywood” video.\\n \\n \\n Trump has previously made veiled – and sometimes explicit – encouragements of violence, going back to the 2016 campaign when his rallies would be interrupted frequently by protesters. \\n \\n \\n More recently, Trump said something similar to his Breitbart remarks at a September rally in Missouri. \\n \\n \\n “The Democrat Party is held hostage by far-left activists, by angry mobs, Antifa, by deep state radicals and their establishment cronies … No, I would never suggest this, but I will tell you, they’re so lucky that we’re peaceful,” Trump said to cheers from the audience. \\n \\n \\n He added, “Law enforcement, military, construction workers, Bikers for Trump – how about Bikers for Trump? They travel all over the country. They got Trump all over the place, and they’re great. They’ve been great. But these are tough people. These are great people. But they’re peaceful people, and Antifa and all – they’d better hope they stay that way. I hope they stay that way. I hope they stay that way.” \\n \\n \\n At a February 2016 campaign rally in Iowa, Trump told the crowd of supporters, “So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. Just knock the hell– I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise.”\\n \\n \\n And at an August 2016 campaign rally in North Carolina, Trump said: “Hillary Clinton wants to abolish – essentially abolish the Second Amendment. By the way, if she gets to pick, if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don’t know.”\\n \\n    No matter what the White House says, President Trump has repeatedly and not-subtly suggested his supporters could be violent — sometimes in an approving manner. And there’s a common thread running through much of it: Again and again, Trump has suggested they could rise up if they feel either they or Trump have been wronged by the political process.  There are several examples. The most well-worn was when Trump suggested during the 2016 campaign that “Second Amendment people” could stop a President Hillary Clinton from installing liberal judges. Trump played it off as a coincidence unrelated to violence that he flagged gun-rights supporters as the last line of defense against a political outcome he opposed. Now, Trump is at it again. And this time, his statement has overtones of something bigger. In an interview with Trump-friendly Breitbart News this week, Trump talked about how “tough” the left was getting, relative to his supporters. His quote meanders a little bit, but stick with it and focus on the text in bold:   It’s so terrible what’s happening. You know, the left plays a tougher game, it’s very funny. I actually think that the people on the right are tougher, but they don’t play it tougher. Okay? I can tell you, I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump – I have the tough people, but they don’t play it tough until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad. But the left plays it cuter and tougher.    As The Washington Post’s David Nakamura pointed out, this is actually quite similar to something Trump said at a September campaign rally for now-Sen. Josh Hawley (R) in Missouri:    They’re so lucky that we’re peaceful. Law enforcement, military, construction workers, Bikers for Trump -- how about Bikers for Trump? They travel all over the country. They got Trump all over the place, and they’re great. They’ve been great. But these are tough people. These are great people. But they’re peaceful people, and Antifa and all -- they’d better hope they stay that way. I hope they stay that way. I hope they stay that way.    Trump’s public comments are often more strategic than his critics give him credit for. He will routinely suggest something without technically saying, “This is what I want.” And he will generally lather himself in plausible deniability. “It would be very bad” and “I hope they stay that way” allow him to say he doesn’t actually want this thing he’s hinting at to happen. But it’s clear from these comments, and the repetition of this formula, that he’s suggesting his supporters from the military, law enforcement and even bikers could be tempted to rise up if things don’t go Trump’s way. He’s at the very least toying with the idea that things could become violent.    A BBC journalist was attacked at a Trump rally in El Paso on Feb. 11. (Video: Allie Caren/The Washington Post)    And his inclusion of the police and the military is conspicuous. Remember a few weeks ago when his former personal attorney Michael Cohen was testifying before a House committee, Cohen said at the end of his testimony that he decided to speak out against Trump because he feared that if Trump lost the 2020 election, he wouldn’t leave. Experts rightly point out that any successful Trump effort to actually stay in office would probably require the complicity of the military, what would essentially be a coup. That’s nearly impossible to imagine. (The inclusion of bikers is also interesting — and timely. As The Post wrote last week, motorcycle gangs known as “colectivos” have served as enforcers for embattled Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. That, of course, wouldn’t explain why Trump included bikers when he said this in September.) But even if a coup seems patently ridiculous, that doesn’t mean there couldn’t be unrest, and it doesn’t mean that Trump isn’t proactively wielding that possibility for leverage against his opponents. Hinting that efforts to remove him from office — either via the 2020 election or impeachment — could be met with this kind of violence serves notice to his foes that they better play nice .\\u2009.\\u2009. and maybe investigators should back off. The idea that anything like the scenes Trump is describing would ever happen is difficult to believe. But that’s not really the point. Musing about this kind of thing is a great way to plant a seed in certain people’s minds, and the fact that Trump keeps fertilizing that seed shouldn’t escape notice.    President Donald Trump warned in an interview that his supporters could “play tough” and make things “very, very bad” if they “reach a certain point.” He cited the police, military and Bikers for Trump as his backers. He didn’t define what that “certain point” might be in the Breitbart interview published Tuesday. But the implication was that his supporters would stand for a limited amount of political decisions that they opposed until the “tough people” made things “very, very bad.” Violence by a military opposed to political decisions would be a coup. “I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of Bikers for Trump,” he said. “I have the tough people, but they don’t play it tough until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.” The president also noted that the “left” plays it “cuter and tougher.” But he didn’t indicate that the “left” would go overboard at any point.  Trump has hinted at possible violence by his supporters a number of times and has even supported it. During his campaign, he once encouraged supporters to “beat the crap out of” protesters, offering to pay the legal fees of anyone who did.     Trump hinted at possible violence by Bikers for Trump at a campaign rally last year for now-Sen. Josh Hawlery (R-Mo.). “They’re peaceful people, and antifa and all — they’d better hope they stay that way,” he said. The Washington Post said that Trump’s stated “hopes” at various times that the situation will remain peaceful provide him with “plausible deniability” should violence erupt. But it’s “clear” from his repeated comments that he’s suggesting his supporters from the military, law enforcement and bikers “could be tempted to rise up if things don’t go Trump’s way,” the Post noted. Trump’s former personal attorney and convicted felon Michael Cohen hinted at an American coup in his testimony before Congress earlier this month, warning that he feared if Trump didn’t win the 2020 election, he wouldn’t peacefully quit the presidency. “Given my experience working for Mr. Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020, that there will never be a peaceful transition of power,” Cohen told the House oversight committee.

Trump spoke to reporters on Friday afternoon, shortly after issuing the first veto of his presidency, which preserved his declaration of an emergency over the threat to American safety from immigrants from Central America. Asked whether he saw white nationalism as a rising threat, Trump demurred. “I don’t really, I think it’s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems, I guess. If you look what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that’s the case. I don’t know enough about it yet … but it’s certainly a terrible thing,” the president said.

(Photo: Evan Vucci/AP)    Trump, who said he reached out to New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to express his “sorrow” over the killings, described the latest terrorist attack to target Muslims as a “horrible, horrible thing.” The president then pivoted to decry “crimes of all kinds coming through our southern border,” adding that “people hate the word invasion, but that’s what it is.” Critics of the president have accused him using rhetoric that stokes unfounded fears about immigrants as he pursues a campaign promise of building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. \"The words and imagery coming out of the Trump administration and from Trump himself are heightening these fears,\" Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project, told reporters on a conference call last month. \"These images of foreign scary invaders threatening diseases, massive refugee caravans coming from the south. This is fear mongering.\" Some white supremacist groups have taken inspiration from Trump’s depiction of immigrants as a threat to American safety and prosperity. Speaking at a 2017 rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke proclaimed “We are determined to take our country back. We’re going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That’s what we’ve believed in, that’s why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said he’s going to take our country back —and that’s what we’ve got to do.” In its annual survey released in February, the Southern Poverty Law Center found that last year the number of hate groups active in the U.S. had risen to its highest level in two decades. _____  Read more from Yahoo News:     Women divided by race over key issues, but with areas of overlap     Some women are happy to let the march pass them by     Maverick Republican William Weld looks to run against Trump\\'s \\'malignant narcissism\\'     The Army\\'s killer drones: How a secretive special ops unit decimated ISIS     The Soviets wanted to infiltrate the Reagan camp.

I think it\\'s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems,” President Trump said in response to a question from ABC News’ Terry Moran in the Oval Office Friday. The president’s comments come on the heels of a deadly attack in New Zealand that targeted Muslims in worship at mosques and left 49 dead and dozens more injured. The president has strongly condemned that attack as an “evil” and “monstrous terrorist attack.”     People stand across the road from a mosque in central Christchurch, New Zealand, March 15, 2019. Mark Baker/AP     In his exchange with Moran, the president went on to qualify that the ideology of white supremacy may have been a factor in the New Zealand attack, which he said he continues to learn more about it. “I guess if you look at what happened in New Zealand perhaps that\\'s a case, I don\\'t know enough about it yet, they\\'re just learning about the person and the people involved but it\\'s certainly a terrible thing, terrible thing,\" Trump said. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate crimes and groups in the US, has reported the number of hate groups in the US has been on the rise for four straight years and has recently reached an all-time high. The president said he spoke with the New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern earlier on Friday and that he expressed the sympathies of the nation and resolve. Asked during a news conference in New Zealand if she agreed with the president’s belief that white nationalism is not on the rise, Ardern offered a one word reply: “No.”    President Donald Trump on Friday was facing scrutiny for comments in a recent interview with Breitbart News in which he warned his \\'tough\\' supporters could turn things \\'very bad\\' if provoked by his political opponents. \"I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump,\" Trump said to Breitbart in an interview Monday after reportedly being asked about \"how the left is fighting hard.\" \"I have the tough people, but they don’t play it tough — until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad,\" he said. Trump tweeted out a link promoting the website Thursday night after several Democrats and political commentators raised issues with the comments and whether they amounted to a potential threat of violence. \"I think it\\'s more than an implicit threat,\" said Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, in an interview Wednesday night on MSNBC. \"It sounds very much to me like he\\'s encouraging them to engage in something that\\'s probably illegal such as assaulting people.\" But Trump deleted the tweet early Friday after news overnight of the massacre at two mosques in New Zealand, though it was not immediately clear whether the attacks had any impact over the decision. The White House did not immediately respond to an ABC News request for comment on the deleted tweet. White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway in an interview on CNN Thursday night disputed that the president was in any way advocating violence from his supporters. \"You have to read the entire interview,\" Conway said. \"He was talking about how peaceful and gentle many people are who are otherwise tough.\" Though the comments follow a trend of the president using veiled language to play up the \"toughness\" of his supporters in the face of what he describes as a radical and unhinged resistance. \"They\\'re so lucky that we\\'re peaceful,\" Trump said in a September 2018 campaign rally. \"Law enforcement, military, construction workers, Bikers for Trump.\" Trump added, \"but they\\'re peaceful people and Antifa and all, they better hope they stay that way.\" Similarly, Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign seemed to raise the specter of possible violence against his opponent Hillary Clinton when he spoke during a North Carolina rally about her desire to tighten the nation\\'s gun laws. \"If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,” Trump said. “Although the Second Amendment people — maybe there is, I don’t know.” At the time, Trump and his campaign insisted he was merely urging gun rights advocates to vote against Clinton.

The new law also adds 1.3 million acres of new wilderness and permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which supports conservation and outdoor recreation projects nationwide. It’s the largest public lands bill Congress has considered in a decade, and it won large bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate. More than 100 land and water conservation bills were combined to designate more than 350 miles of river as wild and scenic, and to create nearly 700,000 acres of new recreation and conservation areas. The new law also withdraws 370,000 acres in Montana and Washington state from mineral development. Trump signed the bill in the Oval Office during a private ceremony with acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and a bipartisan group of lawmakers, the White House said. Bernhardt, who is awaiting Senate confirmation to become the department’s permanent leader, issued a written statement calling the law “extremely beneficial” to the American public. The Land and Water Conservation Fund expired last fall after Congress failed to agree on language to extend it. Lawmakers ultimately voted to make the fund permanent, though its yearly funding will be subject to the annual appropriations process. The fund is one of the most popular and effective programs created by Congress, and it has supported more than 42,000 state and local projects nationwide since it began in 1964, using royalties from offshore oil and gas drilling to fund conservation and recreation projects. Trump has said he wants clean air and clean water, but his administration has rolled back numerous environmental regulations, deeming them burdensome for business. The president has publicly doubted climate change and pulled the U.S. out of a multinational pact that aims to slow the rate of global warming. He installed a former coal lobbyist to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, while Bernhardt is a former energy industry lobbyist. Meanwhile, the budget proposal Trump released Monday would cut the Interior Department’s permanent and discretionary funding for the conservation fund by three-fourths. The law is named for Rep. John Dingell, who died in February. The Michigan Democrat was the longtime chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee and played a leading role in laws dealing with health care, the environment, civil rights and the auto industry. Three new national monuments to be administered by the National Park Service and two others to be overseen by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management will be created under the law. The new monuments are the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Home National Monument in Mississippi; the Mill Springs and Camp Nelson national monuments in Kentucky; the former Saint Francis Dam site in Southern California; and the Jurassic National Monument in Utah. In December 2017, Trump took the rare step of scaling back the sprawling Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah, which were created by Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, respectively. Trump had accused Obama and Clinton of exceeding their executive authority by creating both monuments, each of which had encompassed millions of acres of land. Republicans say the new monuments were created the right way, through the legislative process and not by a president wielding his executive powers. Trump’s move marked the first time in a half century that a president had undone these types of land protections. ___ Associated Press writers Matthew Daly and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report.   A New York court has said that any sitting US president is still able to be tried in a state court, after Donald Trump sought to delay a defamation trial arising from a lawsuit filed by a former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos.  Key points:  Judges find the US Constitution doesn\\'t bar a sitting president from state prosecution Mr Trump is being sued for defamation by a former TV show contestant who claims he groped and kissed her without consent Dissenting judges said the lawsuit would interfere with Mr Trump\\'s job as President, and should wait until he left office   The reality TV contestant\\'s lawsuit claims that the President\\'s repeated denials of her sexual misconduct allegations are factual falsehoods that have subjected her to threats and cost her business at her Southern California restaurant. Ms Zervos has repeatedly accused Mr Trump of kissing her against her will at a 2007 meeting in New York, and later groping her at a Beverly Hills hotel. Mr Trump had earlier sought to dismiss the case entirely but failed. In a 3-2 decision on Thursday, the Appellate Division in Manhattan said the US Constitution did not strip state courts of power to decide cases arising under state constitutions, even if they involved sitting presidents. Despite his suggestion he embodied the executive branch and had significant responsibilities, \"the President is still a person, and he is not above the law,\" Justice Dianne Renwick wrote. The dissenting judges said the lawsuit would interfere with Mr Trump\\'s job as President, and should wait until he left office. One of them, Justice Angela Mazzarelli, said the \"all-consuming nature of the presidency creates a constitutional barrier\" against Ms Zervos\\'s lawsuit. All five justices found Ms Zervos\\'s defamation claim legally sufficient, without ruling on its merits. Mr Trump\\'s lawyer Marc Kasowitz said the President would appeal to the state\\'s highest court, the Court of Appeals, \"which we expect will agree with the dissent\". The decision affirmed a lower court ruling from last March. Lawyers hope to cross-examine Trump        Ms Zervos\\'s says that Mr Trump would abuse meetings designed to give her career advice.(AP: Mary Altaffer)   Ms Zervos first came forward in October 2016, the month before Mr Trump was elected, after an Access Hollywood recording showed the then-Republican candidate speaking in vulgar terms about women.  Mr Trump also republished on Twitter a post calling Zervos\\' accusations a \"hoax\".   Several other women have accused Mr Trump of improper sexual conduct.  Mr Trump has denied Ms Zervos\\'s claims and called her case politically motivated.  Ms Zervos\\'s lawyers are hoping to question Mr Trump under oath about whether he defamed her by calling her a liar after she accused him of sexual misconduct. \"We look forward to proving to a jury that Ms Zervos told the truth about defendant\\'s unwanted sexual groping and holding him accountable for his malicious lies,\" said Ms Zervos\\'s lawyer, Mariann Wang. Paula Jones case led to Clinton impeachment The appeals court called Ms Zervos\\'s case \"materially indistinguishable\" from former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones\\'s lawsuit accusing then-president Bill Clinton of sexual harassment. In 1997, the US Supreme Court let Ms Jones\\'s case go forward.  That paved the way for Mr Clinton\\'s impeachment the following year. Mr Trump has also faced a defamation claim by adult film actress Stormy Daniels in her lawsuit over a hush money agreement.  That lawsuit was dismissed on March 7.

The call to Jay Barrett, who has cystic fibrosis and was recently moved to home hospice care, was arranged by his big sister - a local Democratic lawmaker.   \"You\\'re my kind of man, Jay,\" Mr Trump said in the call. \"You keep that fight going. We both fight,\" he said.   The president\\'s son, Eric, has also promised to send him a special gift.   The call was first reported by the New Haven Register in Connecticut, which has been reporting on the bipartisan effort to connect him to the White House.   \"My brother is very conservative, but politics aside, I think in a family, religion and politics are off the table,\" said his sister, First District City Councilwoman Bridgette Hoskie, who assured the newspaper that she is \"100% Democrat\".   Mr Trump began the call by telling the 44-year-old patient he had just seen a picture of him and he looked \"handsome\".   Mr Barrett laughed off the \"kind honours\" before using an expletive to describe his opinion of his own appearance.   The president told him: \"You\\'re a champ. You\\'re fighting it, right?\"   \"That\\'s what the Irish do, right?\" Mr Barrett replied.    \"Yeah that\\'s what the Irish do - you better believe it,\" the president said, adding that he wished Mr Barrett could come to a rally and complimenting his \"great\" sister.   \"I plan on coming down to DC before my expiration date,\" Mr Barrett told Mr Trump.    Mr Barrett said he is an independent voter who helped elect Barack Obama in 2008, but did not support him in 2012 because of his opposition to the former Democratic president\\'s healthcare policy, the New Haven Register reported.   He told the newspaper he fell in love with Mr Trump\\'s campaign immediately after its launch, and believed that Democrats are always reflexively trying to counter anything he says - right or wrong.   \"If Trump came out and said, \\'Oxygen is good,\\' they\\'d come out and say it\\'s bad,\" Mr Barrett said.   Doctors say Mr Barrett has just six months to live but he is hoping to still be around in 2020.   \"I told him, \\'I plan on voting for you in 2020, God permitting,\\'\" Mr Barrett told the Register.   But some dying Americans are hanging on in hopes of another outcome for Mr Trump.    On Tuesday, NPR reported on two different World War Two veterans who have said in their final moments they wanted to see the outcome of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\\'s investigation into alleged Trump campaign collusion with Russia before they die.   \"I was hoping to live to see the outcome of what I think it should be - justice. I\\'ll be surprised and disappointed if it isn\\'t,\" said 94-year-old Richard Armstrong.

I actually think that the people on the right are tougher, but they don’t play it tougher. Okay? I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump – I have the tough people, but they don’t play it tough — until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad. But the left plays it cuter and tougher. Like with all the nonsense that they do in Congress … with all this invest[igations]—that’s all they want to do is –you know, they do things that are nasty. Republicans never played this.” \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n The suggestion appears to be in reaction to the ongoing investigations of his presidency in the House of Representatives. It came in the context of Trump claiming that former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan did not go far enough in allowing House committees previously under Republican control to issue subpoenas to those considered to be Trump’s political adversaries.\\n Here’s how Breitbart put it:\\n \\n   Trump told Breitbart News in an exclusive lengthy Oval Office interview that Ryan blocked issuance of subpoenas to people he thinks should have been investigated on the political left, and now that the Republicans no longer have the majority in the House, people Trump says Ryan protected may have gotten away with whatever they did that warranted investigation.\\xa0  Trump said that House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) and his predecessor and fellow conservative Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) wanted to be tougher with the left, but that Ryan would not let them.\\xa0  “Paul Ryan wouldn’t give the right to have any subpoenas,” Trump told Breitbart News. “Okay? Now in all fairness, Meadows and Jordan and all these guys, they wanted to go tougher, but they weren’t allowed to by leadership.”\\xa0  Trump’s comments came in a wider part of the conversation about how the left is more “vicious” than the right—and that the left in American politics plays “cuter and tougher.” \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n While it’s perhaps impossible to dissect the precise meaning of Trump’s words here, it appears to be a vague threat that “tough” supporters in the military and police—who are presumably armed and whose work can involve using physical violence—will do something that will result in a “very bad, very bad” outcome if pushed to a “certain point” by the president’s political opponents.* In this context, that certain point might be political investigations reaching a conclusion of impeachment, or maybe just efforts to enforce subpoenas against the president, his family members, and allies. (It could also come in the context of the president’s “vicious” political opponents voting him out of office in the 2020 election, which the president has repeatedly said Democrats cannot win “legitimately.”)\\n \\n \\n \\n Perhaps the “very bad” thing that would happen as a result of “tough” Trump supporters in the military, police, and Bikers for Trump being pushed “to a certain point” would be taking part in a peaceful protest that gets out of hand due to factors beyond their control. Maybe he’s talking about a less violent form of aggression that’s nonetheless “very bad, very bad.”\\n But the more obvious—and plausible—interpretation seems to me to be that the president is suggesting these armed political supporters would respond violently if his presidency is imperiled. Whether or not you view this as empty bluster, that suggestion alone should chill supporters of liberal democracy as much as anything Trump has ever said.\\n Update, March 14, 2019, at 3:54 p.m.: This sentence has been revised to more clearly characterize Trump’s military and police supporters.\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n       Media caption, Trump issues first veto of his presidency      President Donald Trump has vetoed a measure from Congress revoking his declaration of a national emergency at the US-Mexico border.    Lawmakers, including 12 Republicans, had passed the rejection resolution on Thursday in a surprising rebuke of Mr Trump\\'s pledge to build a border wall.   Congress will now need a two-thirds majority in both chambers to override him, which is unlikely to happen.   This is the first veto of Mr Trump\\'s presidency.   \"As president, the protection of the nation is my highest duty,\" Mr Trump said on Friday.    Standing behind the president were law enforcement officials, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Vice-President Mike Pence, Attorney General William Barr and \"angel parents\" - the parents of children killed by illegal immigrants.   \"Yesterday, Congress passed a dangerous resolution that if signed into law, would put countless Americans in danger.   \"Congress has the freedom to pass this resolution and I have the duty to veto it. I\\'m very proud to veto it. \"   Mr Trump repeated his claims that illegal immigrants from the southern border were mostly criminals, bringing drugs into the country.   He had promised a veto of the resolution ending his emergency declaration as soon as the measure was circulated on Capitol Hill.   The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives had passed the resolution to overturn the emergency last month, and 12 Republicans sided with Democratic Senators to clear the Senate in a 59-41 vote on Thursday afternoon.   The renegade conservatives had condemned the emergency declaration for setting up a dangerous precedent for a president while emphasising that they still agreed with Mr Trump\\'s tough border security policies.   Just after the Senate vote, Mr Trump tweeted: \"VETO!\"    How did we get here?    Mr Trump had declared the emergency in February after Congress refused his requests for $5.7bn (Â£4.4bn) to construct a border wall - a campaign promise. By doing so, he opened up access to billions in military funds that do not require approval from lawmakers.   Democrats - and a handful of Republicans - were quick to label the move presidential overreach.   The president has maintained that the situation with migrants at the southern border is a national security and humanitarian crisis, while Democrats have accused him of fear-mongering.    What now?    Following the veto, the resolution will return to the House on 26 March, Speaker for the House Nancy Pelosi said.     On March 26, the House will once again act to protect our Constitution and our democracy from the Presidentâ\\x80\\x99s emergency declaration by holding a vote to override his veto. #FakeEmergency — Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) March 15, 2019 \\n  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter     While Democrats control the House, they would need a total of 67 votes in the Senate to override Mr Trump\\'s veto.    Given that only 12 out of 53 Republicans joined them to pass the initial resolution, it is unlikely that any override measure will be successful.   \"House Republicans will have to choose between their partisan hypocrisy and their sacred oath to support and defend the constitution,\" Mrs Pelosi said in a statement after Mr Trump\\'s announcement.   Republican Senator Lindsey Graham shared his support of Mr Trump\\'s decision.      Totally support President @realDonaldTrump\\'s VETO.

US Attorney General William Barr, who stood beside Mr Trump as he spoke on Friday, said that emergency order was \"clearly authorised under the law\" and \"solidly grounded in law\".     More on this story      \\n \\n \\nWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump\\'s 2016 campaign was a small group of mostly political novices, loyal to the real estate mogul, and led by a rotating cast of managers with varying ideologies. His White House staff expanded beyond the loyalists, but it has continued to suffer from high turnover while also struggling to recruit veteran Republicans. The president\\'s 2020 reelection team, however, is shaping out much differently. Veteran political operatives and top Hill staffers — the type of experienced Republicans who have shown little interest in working for the Trump White House — have already joined the 2020 campaign, and many more are expected to in the coming months. The president\\'s 2020 campaign is managed by Brad Parscale, a Trump ally who had no political experience before the 2016 campaign but is credited with a digital operation that helped lead to Trump\\'s surprise win. One of Parscale’s first moves almost a year ago was bringing on Chris Carr, a longtime Republican strategist, as political director. He also joined forces with the Republican National Committee to an extent that is unprecedented for a modern presidential campaign. And more recently, the campaign has focused on building out its communications operations, adding Tim Murtaugh, who has worked for the RNC, Republican Governors Association, and several campaigns, as communications director. The team has also added Erin Perrine from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\\'s office and Matt Wolking, who has worked for Sens. Bill Cassidy and Marco Rubio. Recently departed White House communications director Bill Shine is also heading to the campaign in a senior adviser role, joining other former White House aides: Bill Stepien, director of political affairs, and Justin Clark from the Office of Public Liaison. \"The difference between an insurgent, antiestablishment campaign and the reelection campaign of a sitting president is enormous,\" said Kevin Madden, who worked on Mitt Romney\\'s 2012 presidential campaign. \"It\\'s like the difference between a pirate ship and a ocean liner.\" \"The challenge in 2016 was convincing campaign talent that Trump was a real candidate who would see the effort all the way through,\" he said. With Election Day still 20 months away, the campaign has raised more than $100 million and has a several dozen staffers split between offices in Washington, DC, and New York City — a stark contrast to the 2016 campaign, which one month before the election still employed only about 130 staffers. The campaign has also already hired the directors for each area of responsibility, according to a spokesperson, and they are beginning to build out their teams. Trump’s reelection effort is using its head start over Democrats’ campaigns to lay “the groundwork for recruiting and training almost 2 million volunteers across the nation,” the spokesperson said. “Time is one of the biggest advantages we have and we aim to use it.” Those close to the administration also acknowledged that the campaign, which so far hasn\\'t seen the type of internal feuding that was common in the 2016 campaign and at the White House, has been a more attractive option for ambitious Republicans. \"The talent pool is a lot higher than the people willing to go to the White House,\" said a source close to the campaign. Another former White House official said joining the campaign made sense because it is the \"closest thing a Republican operative can get to working in an actual White House,” which he and other sources described as too much work for little long-term payoff since several companies and lobbying firms have been reluctant to hire from the Trump White House. \"You\\'re working for the president, but not in as toxic of an environment and for an entity that doesn\\'t tarnish your résumé the way the current White House would,\" the official said. \"On the campaign of adults, you\\'re honing your skills, bettering yourself, and making connections. In the White House of children, you\\'re wasting your time playing whack-a-mole every day.\" Besides a CNN report about Trump’s outside advisers Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie not being invited to a White House meeting about the president’s reelection efforts, so far drama between various power centers in the president’s orbit has been mostly contained. Scott Jennings, a George W. Bush campaign and White House alum, said Trump’s reelection team staffing up and deploying talent early is one of the “several natural advantages” of incumbents so that they can start defining opponents and organizing in key states. The early hiring from Parscale — bringing in Carr — made experienced Republicans more confident in the operation, he said. It sends “a strong signal to operatives that the political shop is going to be professionally run and well-organized, so that gives people confidence in deciding whether to sign up for this tour of duty,” Jennings said, adding that so far the campaign, despite Trump’s tendency to defy norms, is functioning like one would “expect a president’s reelection campaign to be run.” Rick Tyler, a GOP strategist who worked on Sen. Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign and has remained critical of the president, had a more cynical view of members of his party joining the campaign. “$$,” he texted BuzzFeed News. “What else could it be?

Today was far from the first time Trump has referred to migrants and refugees from Central America as an “invasion.” But his public remarks this afternoon, defending his attempt to declare a national emergency at America’s Southern border, came in the immediate wake of what appeared to be a white supremacist terror attack on two New Zealand mosques that left 49 people dead. A document linked to the mosque shooter justified the attack by suggesting that nonwhite immigration was an “invasion.” As The Week put it, “Trump just called immigration an ‘invasion.’ So did the New Zealand shooter.”     \"We are experiencing an invasion on a level never seen before in history.\"  “People hate the word invasion, but that’s what it is.” Two quotes about immigrants in the past 24 hours.

It is a tremendous crisis,” Trump said. Trump claimed there was an “invasion” of migrants storming the US border. “People hate the word invasion, but that’s what it is. It’s an invasion of drugs and criminals and people, we have no idea who they are,” he said. Trump said that immigration detention centers were “bursting at the seams” but he was unwilling to release more people. “When you release them they come into our society and in many cases they’re stone cold criminals,” he said. “You have killers coming in and murderers coming in.”     Beto O’Rourke, speaking in Iowa, said he is “no longer sure” single payer healthcare is the best solution, according to a Wall Street Journal reporter.

In a press conference after he vetoed Congress’ attempt to end his national emergency over border wall funding, Trump was asked various questions in relation to the mass shootings at two mosques in New Zealand on Friday. According to a pool report, one reporter asked the president if he saw a rise in white nationalism around the world.  “I don’t really,” Trump responded. “I think it’s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems, I guess. If you look what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that’s the case. I don’t know enough about it yet. … But it’s certainly a terrible thing.” The president also said he had not seen a manifesto purportedly written by the alleged shooter, who appears to be an avowed white nationalist bent on killing Muslim immigrants. “I did not see it,” Trump said of the manifesto. “But I think it’s a horrible event, it’s a horrible thing. I saw it early in the morning when I looked at what was happening, and we spoke, as you know, to the prime minister. I think it’s a horrible disgraceful thing, horrible act.”  White nationalism is not represented by a “small group of people,” even when only looking at numbers and anecdotes in the United States. Droves of white nationalists have marched through U.S. streets and attacked or killed people. Different extremist groups with ties to white nationalism demonstrate across the country to this day. Groups numbering in the hundreds have worked in tandem to infiltrate the GOP, recruit on college campuses, and attempt to tip the electoral tide in favor of candidates who share their views. They even have political candidates who share their views.  And outside of the U.S., white nationalist factions have been able to congregate publicly on a gargantuan scale. Some 60,000 of them marched to defend “white Europe” in Poland in 2017, for example. And then there’s the internet, where white nationalists gather to plot attacks and share dangerous ideology. Perhaps only a “small” number of people act on their violent rhetoric, but the repercussions are still horrific and very often deadly.       Before You Go     Popular in the Community   You May Like\\n  \\n   One of the most famous and insightful lines Donald Trump offered on the campaign trail in 2016 came during a stop in Iowa, shortly before that state’s caucuses. “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and wouldn’t lose any voters, okay?” Trump said, mimicking firing a gun with his fingers. “It’s, like, incredible.”   It was a comment about the robustness of his base of support, and it repeatedly has been demonstrated to be true. But we’d like to now introduce a corollary that is also true: Trump could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and few of his voters would consider the ensuing murder trial legitimate. Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump appeared on Sean Hannity’s Fox News Channel talk show on Thursday, where she and the host discussed the newly robust House investigations of Trump’s campaign and businesses. “I think that Democrats right now are showing how scared they are with the fact that [special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s] report is probably going to be released soon, because they are frantic to find something else to throw at the president, to throw at anybody close to him,” she said. “That’s why he saw those 81 subpoenas last week. So ridiculous. And just — I mean — people should be shocked and appalled by this in our country. This is not how it’s supposed to work. Just because you’re still upset over an election that happened 2½ years ago, you should not be allowed to try and ruin people’s lives like this.”  She’s referring to 81 letters requesting more information that were sent to people and entities associated with the president in some way. (They were not subpoenas.) But notice how she contextualizes it: It’s a desperate move to whip up a fake controversy targeting her father-in-law. The Mueller inquiry is biased, the argument goes, and with its conclusion, more biased investigations are needed. President Trump, of course, tweeted her comments. Lara Trump is not an impartial observer here, both as a relative of Trump’s and as an adviser to Trump’s campaign. But it’s clear that her sentiment is shared. In December, Quinnipiac University found only 12 percent of Republicans thought the investigation of possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia was legitimate. Trump has been deliberate from the outset of the Mueller investigation in trying to establish its illegitimacy and partisan bias. Polling from HuffPost and YouGov shows that, over the past year, views of Mueller’s efforts have remained static by party and by 2016 vote. It’s an investigation that is most publicly associated with Mueller’s investigation — an inquiry that began in 2017 by then-Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, a Trump appointee. This idea that investigations of Trump are illegitimate extends beyond those centered on the president. When the Manhattan district attorney announced 16 new indictments against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort on Wednesday, a Republican consultant who spoke with the New York Times made clear how it would be framed. “Any and every action even perceived to be a threat against him or his presidency will be framed as political retribution and an effort to undermine his 2016 victory,” he said — echoing Lara Trump’s later interview. Trump has been pitching this product since his first month in office.   The Democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election, and so badly (306), so they made up a story - RUSSIA. Fake news!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 16, 2017 \\n Manafort and Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen admitted to criminal acts, but Trump supporters either note those charges weren’t related to Trump or, in the case of the campaign-finance charges admitted to by Cohen, they weren’t actual crimes. Everything is trumped up and illegitimate until it isn’t, at which point it’s moved to an arm’s length. One wonders what might break this spell. What might emerge from the House investigations that would be so damning as to give even Trump’s most fervent supporters pause? There may be nothing at all, of course, but this is a president who was sued for fraud in connection with his real estate “university” and whose machinations surrounding his nonprofit foundation were well known before the election. He was on tape bragging about groping women and then insisted that allegations he had groped specific women were all lies — and it doesn’t seem to have done much to dent his popularity in some quarters. But what if it has shown that he committed insurance fraud, as Cohen intimated during congressional testimony? What if he actually did directly collude with an agent of Russia, the main qualifier identified by Trump fans as demonstrating collusion in an informal survey we conducted. Or something else? It would be an interesting political experiment if Trump were to shoot someone dead, how his base might respond to what happened next. We would nonetheless prefer he not undertake it. What Trump was saying when he made that “Fifth Avenue” comment wasn’t just that his base was loyal. It was that he could hold their loyalty. It’s hard to believe that only 12 percent of Republicans would view the Russia investigation as illegitimate if Trump hadn’t been constantly harping on about its illegitimacy.   A New York appellate court on Thursday rejected President Trump’s attempt to block the defamation suit of an Orange County woman who says he lied during the 2016 campaign about sexually assaulting her at the Beverly Hills Hotel. The court’s 3-to-2 ruling enables Summer Zervos, a former contestant on “The Apprentice,” to press forward toward a Manhattan trial of her allegation that Trump defamed her by branding her a liar in the weeks before he was elected president. Trump’s legal team argued that the U.S. Constitution immunizes him from state court lawsuits arising from his private conduct before he took office. The court disagreed, opening the way for Trump to be deposed about what Zervos says was a sexual assault in his bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2007. “Should the trial court find it necessary to require the president to testify, it could allow him to do so by videotape, as has been the custom in recent proceedings involving sitting presidents,” Justice Dianne T. Renwick wrote in the majority opinion. Zervos attorney Mariann Wang said she was pleased the court affirmed Trump was “not above the law.” “We look forward to proving to a jury that Ms. Zervos told the truth about [Trump’s] unwanted sexual groping and holding him accountable for his malicious lies,” she said. Trump attorney Marc E. Kasowitz said the president will appeal the decision to the New York Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court. “We respectfully disagree with the majority decision in the Appellate Division,” he said. Kasowitz said he agreed with a dissenting opinion by Justice Angela M. Mazzarelli that state courts are barred from hearing cases against a sitting president. Zervos was one of more than a dozen women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct in the weeks before the November 2016 election.   What do a porn star, a combative lawyer and a reality-TV contestant all have in common? Trump »   She says she arrived at the Beverly Hills Hotel for dinner with Trump one night in 2007 and was escorted to his bungalow, where he aggressively kissed her open-mouthed and placed a hand on her breast. After she pushed him away and expressed her disinterest, she says, he pressed his genitals against her and tried to kiss her again. In October 2016, a week after the release of an “Access Hollywood” tape of Trump saying women let him grab them by the crotch because he was famous, Zervos, a Republican, said at a news conference: “You do not have the right to treat women as sexual objects just because you are a star.” Trump denied meeting her at the hotel or greeting her inappropriately. He repeatedly called her a liar. She sued him just before his January 2017 inauguration. Thursday’s court ruling cited the U.S. Supreme Court’s rejection of President Clinton’s attempt to block the federal lawsuit that Paula Jones filed against him for sexual harassment. The New York court disagreed with Trump’s argument that the Jones ruling did not apply to a state court, saying “though he is tasked with significant responsibilities, the president is still a person, and he is not above the law.” The president is immune from lawsuits for actions taken in his official capacity, the court acknowledged, but not for his private conduct before taking office. Trump’s lawyers also argued that it would violate the U.S. Constitution if a state court were allowed to hold a president in contempt. The New York justices dismissed the scenario as hypothetical. State courts “are fully aware that they should not compel the president to take acts or refrain from taking acts in his official capacity or otherwise prevent him from executing the responsibilities of the presidency,” Renwick wrote.   \\nThe New York Times: Digital and Home Delivery Subscriptions\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Offer for a New York Times News subscription; current subscribers not eligible.

According to the Journal, the president has given out his personal telephone number to world leaders and has encouraged them to call whenever they feel like it. However, this has created problems for American officials who are left in the dark about what the president is promising to other leaders. \"We never know who he’s talking to or what he’s agreed to,\" one official told WSJ. The Journal\\'s sources say the limits of this kind of diplomacy became clear when Trump thought his personal relationship with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un would be enough to get him to dismantle his entire nuclear weapons program. The other problem is that Trump may make promises that he cannot keep, such as when he vowed to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to completely withdraw American forces from Syria, only to totally reverse himself months later. Foreign policy expert Richard Haass tells WSJ that multiple foreign officials have called him asking for help figuring out how to understand what Trump and his administration really want. “I should have a nickel for every foreign minister who has asked me to help decipher and interpret this administration,” he said. “They just don’t know how to read it. It’s been a nightmare for ambassadors and foreign ministers.” <div><div>\\n\\t<h2>President Donald Trump is not happy that former House Speaker Paul Ryan blocked subpoenas of people and entities Trump thinks the House GOP should have been investigating during the first two years of his administration.</h2>\\n<p>Trump told Breitbart News in an exclusive lengthy Oval Office interview that Ryan blocked issuance of subpoenas to people he thinks should have been investigated on the political left, and now that the Republicans no longer have the majority in the House, people Trump says Ryan protected may have gotten away with whatever they did that warranted investigation.</p>\\n<p>Trump said that House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep.

I actually think that the people on the right are tougher, but they don’t play it tougher. Okay? I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump – I have the tough people, but they don’t play it tough — until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad. But the left plays it cuter and tougher. Like with all the nonsense that they do in Congress … with all this invest[igations]—that’s all they want to do is –you know, they do things that are nasty. Republicans never played this.”</p>\\n<figure></figure>\\n<p>Trump’s relationship with Ryan during Ryan’s tenure was fraught with peril from the get-go. Ryan only hesitantly backed Trump’s 2016 campaign in 2016 once Trump won the GOP nomination, but then backed off from supporting Trump after the release of the infamous <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape. Ryan ditched on a campaign event he had scheduled with Trump that weekend, and the following week held a conference call with House GOP members in early October 2016 in which he told members it would be acceptable to him if they abandoned the GOP nominee for president just weeks before the 2016 election.</p>\\n<p>“I am not going to defend Donald Trump—not now, not in the future,” Ryan said on the private call, audio of which was obtained by Breitbart News and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190314172326/https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2017/03/13/exclusive-audio-emerges-of-when-paul-ryan-abandoned-donald-trump-i-am-not-going-to-defend-donald-trump-not-now-not-in-the-future/\">published in early 2017</a>.</p>\\n<p>Ryan followed through on that and never campaigned with Trump.

Now that he occupies the Oval Office and Air Force One, rather than a private jet with enough gold to plate the outside of a Greyhound bus, Trump is learning that aerospace is not so simple, especially without the aid of a full director of the Federal Aviation Administration, the multibillion-dollar agency responsible for overseeing all civil aviation in the United States. The role has been filled on an acting basis since the five-year term of Michael Huerta, an appointee of President Barack Obama, ended in January 2018. The president has yet to name a replacement, one year after reportedly pushing for Dunkin to assume the role. The intermingling of a president’s private life with the federal bureaucracy would have been uncommon for the aviation authority. Yet the move would have been in line with Trump’s insistence on personal loyalty, highlighted recently by revelations that he pressured his staff to grant security clearances to his daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner. The expertise required of FAA leadership was underscored on Wednesday as American regulators were forced to reverse themselves and ground the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, following a deadly crash in Ethiopia on Sunday and another several months ago in Indonesia. Earlier in the week, as the rest of the world moved to take the jetliner out of the sky, administration officials resisted bipartisan calls to do the same, insisting that the airplanes exhibited “no systemic performance issues.” New tracking data and evidence from Sunday’s crash revealed parallels to the disaster in Indonesia, causing them to change their minds. Trump declared the about-face at a previously scheduled immigration event on Wednesday, surprising federal aviation officials who thought the announcement would be entrusted to them, as The Washington Post reported. In meetings earlier that day, the president had scorned the Boeing 737 Max, saying the jetliners “sucked.” He said he preferred the 757, the model of his private jet, known as Trump Force One. Dunkin shared Trump’s assessment of the private jet, reportedly purchased for $100 million in 2010. In the Smithsonian segment, the pilot rhapsodized about its virtues, calling it the “Ferrari of airplanes.”  Measuring 155 feet long, with a wing span of 125 feet, it boasts twin Rolls-Royce engines that can propel the plane to 41,000 feet in 20 minutes, Dunkin said. “It takes turbulence very, very well,” he noted. A smooth journey meant that Trump could enjoy watching television on a 57-inch screen. The aircraft also includes two bedrooms and a shower. “Any man who flies for Donald Trump is no ordinary pilot,” the narrator of the segment proclaimed. “John Dunkin has aviation in his blood.”  His father, who was a military pilot, began teaching Dunkin to fly when he was 15, he said. He learned to steer a plane before he learned to drive. “It’s just something that always fascinated me,” he said. When he came under consideration for the top FAA job, Dunkin met at least one key criteria, as a Bloomberg News report observed at the time: “loyalty.” Axios reported that Trump had personally recommended Dunkin, who most recently ushered him to campaign events during his bid for the White House. In the Smithsonian segment, Trump sang his personal pilot’s praises. “You need somebody with great integrity,” he said. “There’s tremendous amounts of money at stake.”  Trump added, “John Dunkin really epitomizes to me what that’s all about.” Not everyone was as impressed with Dunkin’s credentials. Writing in Forbes last year, Christine Negroni, an aviation and travel journalist, wrote that “being a pilot, even a great pilot, as Trump proclaims Dunkin to be, is not enough to lead the FAA.” More important, she wrote, was knowledge of regulation and safety. Trump was unbowed. “John Dunkin isn’t just a pilot,” an administration official told Axios. “He’s managed airline and corporate flight departments, certified airlines from start-up under FAA regulations, and oversaw the Trump presidential campaign’s air fleet, which included managing all aviation transportation for travel to 203 cities in 43 states over the course of 21 months.”  Following an inquiry this week from The Washington Post, the White House declined to say whether the president still viewed Dunkin as suitable for the role, or whether he had plans to nominate someone in light of the pressure facing the agency. In the meantime, Trump has left the work of overseeing the “safety and efficiency of the largest aerospace system in the world,” as the authority’s website defines the mandate of the job, to an acting administrator, Daniel K. Elwell, who was named to the agency’s deputy role in June 2017. All three spots in the office of the administrator are currently filled on an acting basis. FAA administrator is one of nearly 150 positions requiring Senate confirmation for which Trump has not put forward a nominee, according to data compiled by The Post and the Partnership for Public Service. But the uncertainty at the top of the FAA has been especially notable this week, as the agency grappled with the fate of the Boeing aircraft and as Trump mused on Twitter about the complexity of modern airplane technology. Chris Lu, former deputy secretary of labour under President Barack Obama, wrote on Twitter that Trump was ill-equipped to address the fallout so long as the “critical position” at the FAA’s helm went unfilled. The man he wanted for the job was someone whom the president “trusts with his life,” as the narrator of the Smithsonian segment described Dunkin. Addressing reporters on Wednesday, Trump signalled that his concerns had broadened. “The safety of the American people and all people is our paramount concern,” he said.

The former Ukip leader allegedly told the US president to support the UK leaving the EU without a deal during a meeting in Washington this month. And just hours after parliament voted to rule out a no-deal Brexit - and hours before further votes on a potential extension of Article 50 - Mr Trump posted an early morning tweet which will be interpreted by many as meeting Mr Farage\\'s request. He wrote: \"My Administration looks forward to negotiating a large scale Trade Deal with the United Kingdom. The potential is unlimited!\" High-profile Brexiteers have long claimed a trade deal with the US would be one of the key benefits to breaking with the EU, but critics have cautioned any agreement would likely take years and result in lowered food and agriculture standards, as well as further privatisation of the NHS.   \\nTrump and Farage - a working friendshipShow all 7  The US trade representative\\'s office had said it would launch talks with Britain after what was initially its planned exit from the EU on 29 March. Last month it laid out its objectives for a deal that included reduced tariff and non-tariff barriers for US industrial and agricultural goods. Mr Trump has made the US economy and trade a cornerstone of his presidency in line with his \"America First\" campaign, and has sought to renegotiate pacts with China, Canada and Mexico as well as the EU. Mr Farage said he made the request to the president at the Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) in the capital last week. The pair were pictured at the meeting, smiling with their thumbs raised.  \"I was talking to him about Vietnam, where he had said that a bad deal was on the table so sometimes you have to walk. That was the exact quote from Trump.\" Mr Farage told The Daily Telegraph.  \"I said in the case of Vietnam that no deal was better than a bad deal and I gave my opinion that the same principle applied to Brexit,\" he said. \"I think if you read the comments from his ambassador in London, I don\\'t think it takes much reading between the lines. \"This American administration firmly believes in the nation state, not supranational structures and this administration are hugely keen on the defence, security and indeed business relationships that exist between our two countries.  Anne Coulter on Donald Trump: \\' You\\'ve been lied to\\'  \"And I think it\\'s fair to say they see Brexit as a great opportunity.\" Mr Trump became friends during his campaign when the former Ukip leader, dubbed \"Mr Brexit\", was greeted at a rally in Mississippi before the 2016 election. The two were also pictured just after the election, at Trump tower in New York, where Mr Farage appeared to be spearheading a new relationship between the UK and US. Mr Trump has spoken highly of Mr Farage in the past, stating that he would do \"a great job\" as British ambassador to the US.  Additional reporting by PA       Republicans’ rebuke of his national emergency shows how uninterested the president is in executing his own agenda.      Carlos Barria / Reuters      Even with his signature policy proposal at stake, even with his own party pushing back more than ever before, even with the first veto of his presidency on the table, President Donald Trump just couldn’t be bothered to try to persuade Congress to back him. The result was a 59–41 vote to block his declaration of a national emergency to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. It’s the biggest rebellion among Republican senators against the president, with 12 Republicans joining every Democrat to halt the declaration, and it comes one day after the previous biggest rebellion—a vote to defund the Saudi war in Yemen, which drew seven Republicans. The direct effects of the Senate rebuke are relatively minimal, because it’s mostly symbolic. Trump has vowed to veto the resolution of disapproval, and there aren’t enough votes in the Senate to override him. Since the law allows the president to declare an emergency and Congress can block it only after the fact, the declaration will remain in place. The more consequential battle is likely to come in the courts.  Read: The Senate could embarrass Trump over his national emergency  But beyond the symbolism of this vote, Trump’s nearly complete disengagement with Congress connects the emergency declaration to his broader legislative approach. Despite the stakes of the vote, Trump put little effort into trying to persuade senators that they should stick with him. The president tweeted a few times about it, but, then again, he tweets about a lot of things. He hosted a White House event on drug trafficking at the border on Wednesday, but no senators were invited. Trump has had plenty of distractions—collapsed negotiations with North Korea, visits from Czech and Irish leaders, a visit to victims of a tornado in Alabama, the ongoing Michael Cohen saga, and Paul Manafort’s sentencing hearings—but he also spent the weekend at Mar-a-Lago, getting in some rounds of golf. When White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders was asked on Monday what Trump was doing to whip votes, she could barely even be bothered to claim he was trying. “Certainly, we talk to a number of members every single day, certainly at the presidential and the staff level,” she said. “And we’re going to continue to engage with them in this process.” Likewise, a White House official told my colleague Peter Nicholas that the situation was “not all-hands-on-deck, pedal-to-the-metal” and that “people can vote their will.” Instead, the White House dispatched Vice President Mike Pence to the Hill. Although Pence was previously a member of the House, he has shown little ability to sway Congress. Pence came close to cutting a deal with Senator Mike Lee, the Utah Republican who expressed constitutional concerns about Trump’s declaration. Lee’s proposal would have effectively let Trump have this emergency, but it would have limited presidents’ authority in the future. But Trump rejected the idea, undercutting Pence, and Lee announced that he’d vote for the resolution blocking Trump’s emergency declaration after all. Trump’s outreach to senators was so minimal that on Wednesday night,  The Washington Post reported, Senators Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz, and Ben Sasse showed up unannounced at the White House, while Trump ate with the first lady, to plead with him, but they weren’t able to make any headway. The result was that the rebels included not just constitutionally focused senators like Lee and Rand Paul, and not just moderates like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, but even senators like Mitt Romney, who has been personally opprobrious of the president but generally supports him on policy.  Conor Friedersdorf: The Senate finds its backbone  “With Trump, everything is possible,” Graham told the Post after his visit to the White House, trying to remain optimistic. “Rabbits being pulled out of a hat are just everyday business.” Everything may be possible, but Trump rolling up his sleeves remains highly improbable. Time and again, he has declined to put much effort into lobbying Congress, even on his top priorities. (His lack of interest echoes that of his predecessor, Barack Obama, who had a distant relationship with Congress.) The prime example in Trump’s term is the failed attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, during which Trump sent members mixed signals and declined to ever commit to any particular outline or strategy. He also didn’t bother to really press Congress for funding for the border wall when Republicans controlled both houses. (A cynic might conclude that Trump was more interested in using the wall as a political bludgeon than in actually building it.) The sole notable exception is the slate of tax cuts that Trump rammed through in late 2017—and those turned out to be a political and economic dud. The political effects of this disengagement are blunted on the wall, since Trump can veto the resolution and move forward, at least as far as federal courts allow. But Trump’s continued lack of interest will have an impact on his ability to enact more of his agenda and add to a historically thin set of legislative achievements. As  Politico reported on Thursday, the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement—the ungainly name affixed to Trump’s NAFTA replacement—is the president’s next top priority, but he has entrusted its passage to Speaker Nancy Pelosi. That’s in part a realistic decision, since Pelosi controls the House, but it’s also a risky one: Why should she do anything to help Trump? Convincing Pelosi to move means convincing enough of her members that it’s to their benefit that she move. If the president isn’t even interested in convincing friendly Republicans to work with him, how is he going to sway skeptical Democrats?   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Trump: I feel badly for Paul Manafort\\n \\n 01:19\\n \\n - Source:\\n CNN\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n Washington\\n CNN\\n \\xa0—\\xa0\\n \\n\\n \\n President Donald Trump said he feels “badly” for his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was sentenced to additional prison time on Wednesday and charged with new crimes in New York.\\n \\n \\n “I feel badly for him,” Trump said, describing Manafort’s legal troubles as a “very sad situation.”\\n \\n \\n Manafort was ordered Wednesday to serve an additional 43 months on federal conspiracy charges, bringing his total sentence between two federal courts to 7.5 years in twin cases stemming from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.\\n \\n \\n US District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson told Manafort that, despite his apologies to the courtroom, his lawyers’ arguments about the absence of any charges directly linked to collusion in the 2016 election were “just one more thing that’s inconsistent with the notion of any genuine acceptance of responsibility.”\\n \\n \\n In a plea cut in September 2018, Manafort admitted to money laundering, tax fraud and illegal foreign lobbying connected to his years of lucrative work for Ukrainian politicians, as well as defrauding banks to supplement his income with cash through mortgages.\\n \\n \\n \\n He pleaded guilty to two criminal charges: conspiracy against the US and conspiracy witness tampering, which he committed after his arrest.\\n \\n \\n Jackson also considered that he intentionally lied to investigators and under oath before a grand jury about his contact with a Russian associate during the 2016 campaign, breaking his plea agreement.\\n \\n \\n “I am sorry for what I’ve done,” Manafort told the courtroom. “Let me be very clear, I accept the responsibility for the acts that caused me to be here today.”\\n \\n \\n Manafort was then hit with new criminal charges in New York City not even an hour after learning his prison sentence for federal crimes.\\n \\n \\n The new case throws a curveball to growing chatter that the President could pardon him.

In a 3-2 decision in favor of former contestant Summer Zervos, the Appellate Division in Manhattan said the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause did not deprive state courts of authority to decide cases arising under state constitutions, even if they involved sitting presidents. Despite suggesting that he embodies the executive branch and has significant responsibilities, “the President is still a person, and he is not above the law,” the court said. The decision may allow Zervos’ lawyers to question Trump under oath about whether he defamed her by calling her a liar after she accused him of sexual misconduct. But the split decision likely foreshadows an appeal, perhaps to the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals. A lawyer for Trump was not immediately available for comment. Zervos’ lawyer Mariann Wang said in a statement: “We look forward to proving to a jury that Ms. Zervos told the truth about defendant’s unwanted sexual groping and holding him accountable for his malicious lies.” (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)    for-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-up       Image source, DUP     Arlene Foster met US President Donald Trump at a St Patrick\\'s Day celebrations lunch in Washington on Thursday.

(Getty)    Regardless of your feelings on President Trump, you can’t deny that the man knows and loves his golf. He’s put his name on well over a dozen courses around the world, he’s hosted majors at his clubs, and he can pick up the phone and get Tiger Woods or Dustin Johnson in his foursome. Oh, and he’s apparently a good enough golfer that he can win tournaments he doesn’t even enter. The latest Trump Golf Story — they’re like fish stories, except bigger, so much bigger, the biggest — comes to us courtesy of Golf.com’s esteemed Michael Bamberger, who reports that Trump’s locker at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla. boasts a new plaque. This one reads “2018 Men’s Club Champion.” (This isn’t fake news. You can see a photo of the locker right here.) Winning a club championship is a heck of a feat for anyone, especially a 72-year-old man with a demanding day job. (Fact check: During 2018, Donald Trump was serving as president of the United States.) But here’s the really wild part: Trump didn’t even play in the tournament. So how did he end up with that plaque on his locker, a commemoration of his 20th club championship? (All of those club championships have come at clubs Trump owns, which definitely helps ensure the engraver spells his name correctly.) According to Bamberger, the original winner was a gentleman by the name of Ted Virtue, a CEO with memberships at Winged Foot and Trump International. Virtue claims a handicap of 3.3, and he’s backed that up with 20 scores posted in 2018 and 2019 ranging from 73 to 83. Not PGA Tour-level play, but pretty dang solid for a 58-year-old. (Trump, for the record, claims a handicap of 2.8, and has only posted two scores since 2016.) Virtue, who was part of the team that helped make the Academy Award-winning “The Green Book,” won the club championship the usual way, by triumphing in multiple matches. Somewhere along the line, Trump and Virtue actually crossed paths. And at that point, Trump, according to multiple sources, said something along the lines of “The only reason you won is because I couldn’t play.” Trump cited the obligations of being, you know, president of the United States as his reason for missing the club championship. So then Trump proposed a deal that Virtue couldn’t refuse: a nine-hole playoff for the title of club champion. When your president wants you to play golf, and said president also owns the club, well, you play golf. (Bamberger notes that club officials are not permitted to discuss club matters, and neither Virtue nor Eric Trump, who runs the president’s golf course business, returned his inquiries regarding the unique knockout round.) No rules officials or television cameras were on hand for this unconventional sudden-death playoff, but Trump nonetheless claimed victory. He then turned to Virtue, according to Bamberger’s sources, and said, effectively, “This isn’t fair — we’ll be co-champions.” And that’s how it’s listed in the clubhouse’s championship wall, with Trump and Virtue as co-champions. Clearly there was some oversight in not adding the “co-” to Trump’s plaque on his locker. Trump has visited his Florida club 18 times in the last year, part of the 161 estimated golf trips he’s taken since taking office, so perhaps he’ll be able to have someone get that corrected the next time he’s in town. ____   Jay Busbee  is a writer for Yahoo Sports.

There is incredible pressure on the F.A.A. to take similar action in the U.S., with two unions representing flight attendants imploring the regulator to suspend the flights, saying customers’ confidence can only be restored “by grounding the 737 Max until the required changes have been implemented and the public can be fully assured.” On Tuesday, after offering an incomprehensible take on modern aviation, it seemed as though the president was poised to demand the F.A.A. stop all 737 Max flights, whether through private channels or simply by angrily tweeting at them. Luckily, though, this particular commander in chief is rendered powerless by those who kiss the ring:  With more countries grounding Boeing jets and with lawmakers, aviation workers, and consumers calling on the United States to do the same, the head of the aerospace giant on Tuesday made a personal appeal to President Trump.   Boeing’s chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, called from Chicago and expressed to Mr. Trump his confidence in the safety of the 737 Max 8 jets, according to two people briefed on the conversation. Two of the planes flown by overseas carriers have crashed in recent months in similar accidents.   Boeing’s relationship with Mr. Trump has not always been smooth, however. Shortly after becoming president-elect, Mr. Trump assailed Boeing for the estimated cost of its program to build new Air Force One planes, which provide mobile command centers for the president . . . A couple of weeks later, Mr. Muilenburg visited Mr. Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., to try to smooth things over . . . Weeks after the conversation, Boeing donated $1 million to Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee.  In a statement, transportation secretary Elaine Chao—who, along with her entire staff, took an 737 Max from Austin, Texas, to Washington, D.C., on Tuesday afternoon to make a point—said her department and F.A.A. regulators “will not hesitate to take immediate and appropriate action,” if necessary. Boeing, meanwhile, maintains its jets are safe, and said in its own statement that, “based on the information currently available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance to operators.”  Update: *Hours after the New York Times story reporting the call was published, Trump announced that the F.A.A. would order the grounding of all Boeing 737 Max 8 and Max 9 jets “until further notice.”\\xa0* That Trump is easy to flatter is, of course, not the only thing Boeing has going for it as it fights to keep the 737 Max in U.S. airspace. For starters, Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan is a former Boeing executive. Also, per The New York Times, the company also spent $15 million on lobbying last year. Oh, and it basically acts as its own regulator, effectively signing off on the safety of its planes:  For decades, the F.A.A. has used a network of outside experts, known as F.A.A. designees, to certify that aircraft meet safety standards. In 2005, the regulator shifted its approach for how it delegated authority outside the agency, creating a new program through which aircraft manufacturers like Boeing could choose their own employees to be the designees and help certify their planes. The program is intended to help the F.A.A. stretch its limited resources, while also benefiting plane makers who are eager to avoid delays in the certification process.   The regulator maintains offices inside Boeing’s factories, including those in Renton, Wash., and in Charleston, S.C. . . . The F.A.A.’s top safety official, Ali Bahrami, has worked closely with Boeing during his career, directing the agency’s certification of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the 747-8 passenger and freighter models.  “It’s a very cozy relationship,” Jim Hall, the former head of the National Transportation Safety Board, told the Times. “The manufacturer essentially becomes both the manufacturer and the regulator, because of the lack of the ability of government to do the job.” Comforting!

Donald Trump is close to finalizing plans to relax restrictions on drilling for gas and oil in areas that were meant to protect an imperiled species of bird   Donald Trump is close to finalizing plans to relax restrictions on drilling for gas and oil in areas that were meant to protect an imperiled species of bird.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The changes are intended to protect the greater sage-grouse while addressing concerns that existing policies governing millions of acres of federal land were too restrictive,\\xa0U.S. Bureau of Land Management Acting Director Brian Steed said. Critics say the changes will lead to more disturbances of grouse habitat, undermining efforts to shore up the bird\\'s population.\\xa0 A formal announcement is expected on Friday. The changes address a suite of sweeping land management plans for portions of 11 Western states that were adopted in 2015 under former President Barack Obama to keep the struggling bird from slipping toward extinction. The ground-dwelling sage grouse is known for an elaborate mating ritual in which males puff out air sacs in their chest to attract female birds.\\xa0 They\\'ve seen steep declines due to energy development, disease and other factors.  The changes are intended to protect the greater sage-grouse while addressing concerns that existing policies governing millions of acres of federal land were too restrictive, U.S. Bureau of Land Management Acting Director Brian Steed said  The birds once numbered in the millions but the most recent estimates from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service places the population at between 200,000 to 500,000. The 2015 plans capped years of negotiations involving government, industry and advocacy groups. They were intended to prevent grouse from being listed as a threatened or endangered species.\\xa0 Such a designation could have brought severe limitations on grazing, energy development and other activities across the bird\\'s range, which covers some 270,000 square miles. Under President Donald Trump, Interior Department officials have vowed to lift obstacles to drilling. Grouse protections have long been viewed by the energy industry as an obstacle to development. Steed said the broad revisions to the Obama-era plans were meant to move beyond what he called a \\'one-size-fits-all\\' approach under the old rules.\\xa0 He said the changes give more flexibility to land managers and states concerned about balancing economic development with protections for the bird. \\'Our intent was not to throw out the plans, but to make them better respond to the needs on the ground,\\' Steed said. \\'We\\'re doing that in a very careful way to ensure that the bird\\'s protections are still in effect.\\' The new plans are expected to remove the most protective habitat designations for about 13,000 square miles (34,000 square kilometers) of public land.\\xa0 Those areas, considered essential to the species\\' survival, were a centerpiece of the Obama policy. The Trump administration also would drop some requirements to prioritize leasing for oil and gas outside sage grouse habitat and allow for more waivers for drilling. Opponents are expected to challenge the changes in court. Brian Rutledge with the Audubon Society said the changes will make it harder to stop the long-term decline of sage grouse by giving oil and gas companies access to crucial grouse habitat. \\'It\\'s a free for all, based on prioritizing fossil fuel extraction over any other use of the federal landscape,\\' Rutledge said. But state officials including Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, signaled their support of the changes. \\'We look forward to working with the BLM and our local communities to move important conservation measures forward to protect greater sage grouse in Colorado,\\' Polis said in a statement. In Wyoming, one of the most important remaining strongholds for the species, Republican Gov. Mark Gordon said the changes would \\'provide predictability\\' for economic development while conserving grouse.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Trump warns: Police, military supporters could get tough\\n \\n \\n \\n In an interview with Breitbart News, President Trump said he has the support of the police, military and \"Bikers for Trump\" and warns that \"it would be very bad\" if they have to get tough on his opponents.\\n \\n 02:56\\n \\n - Source:\\n CNN\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n Stories worth watching\\n 16 videos\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Trump warns: Police, military supporters could get tough\\n \\n \\n \\n 02:56\\n  \\n Now playing\\n \\n  - Source:\\n CNN\\n \\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\'Proud to see it\\': CNN anchor reacts to new doll collection with Disney\\n \\n \\n \\n 03:18\\n  \\n Now playing\\n \\n  - Source:\\n CNN\\n \\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Michelle Yeoh on how her Oscar-nominated role was first offered to Jackie Chan\\n \\n \\n \\n 03:27\\n  \\n Now playing\\n \\n  - Source:\\n CNN\\n \\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Neil deGrasse Tyson on UFOs and aliens in space\\n \\n \\n \\n 01:12\\n  \\n Now playing\\n \\n  - Source:\\n CNN\\n \\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Forget influencers. \\'Deinfluencing\\' is now a thing\\n \\n \\n \\n 01:44\\n  \\n Now playing\\n \\n  - Source:\\n CNN Business\\n \\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Watch the 2023 Super Bowl ads\\n \\n \\n \\n 01:17\\n  \\n Now playing\\n \\n  - Source:\\n CNN Business\\n \\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\'Dr. Phil\\' show is coming to an end.

U.S. presidents may not claim constitutional protection to gain temporary immunity from private lawsuits over alleged misconduct, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court said. \"We reject defendant President Trump\\'s argument that the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution prevents a New York State court\\xa0— and every other state court in the country\\xa0— from exercising its authority under its state constitution,\" the five-justice\\xa0panel ruled in a decision written by Justice Dianne Renwick. \"Instead, we find that the Supremacy Clause was never intended to deprive a state court of its authority to decide cases and controversies under the state\\'s constitution.\"  Stormy Daniels: Daniels arrest not motivated by politics but still improper, investigation finds   Avenatti and Daniels: Michael Avenatti splits with Stormy Daniels for \\'various reasons that we cannot disclose\\'  \"Though he is tasked with significant responsibilities, the President is still a person, and he is not above the law,\" the court added.   Although the\\xa0justices concurred that Zervos\\' case presented a valid argument for defamation, Justices Angela Mazzarelli and Peter Tom\\xa0said the lawsuit should be delayed until Trump leaves office. \"Subjecting the President to a state trial court\\'s jurisdiction imposes upon him a degree of control by the State of New York that interferes with his ability to carry out his constitutional duty of executing the laws of the United States,\" Mazzarelli wrote in the partial dissent.\\xa0 The majority ruling upheld an earlier New York Supreme Court decision that allowed the case to go forward.\\xa0In June, justices of New York\\'s highest court rejected efforts by Trump\\'s lawyers to win\\xa0a temporary block of legal discovery in the Zervos case. The decision set\\xa0the stage for a likely pretrial deposition of Trump sometime this spring or summer. \"We respectfully disagree with the majority decision in the Appellate Division,\" said Trump\\'s attorney Marc Kasowitz in a statement that called the partial dissent \"well reasoned.\" \"We will seek to appeal the majority decision to New York’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, which we expect will agree with the dissent,\" he said.

Filed in January 2017, Zervos\\' lawsuit alleges\\xa0that Trump “ambushed” her more than once in 2007, nine years before he was elected president, by kissing her on the mouth, touching her breast, and pressing his genitals against her. Zervos also accused Trump of defaming her during presidential campaign rallies and via Twitter. During an Oct. 15, 2016, campaign stop in Maine, Trump\\xa0alluded to Zervos by referring to \"false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect Hillary Clinton President,\" the lawsuit charges. Trump has denied Zervos\\' allegations and dismissed them as false. During state Supreme Court arguments in the case,\\xa0Kasowitz said Trump\\'s statements about Zervos were constitutionally protected remarks in which he defended himself. Trump\\'s attorneys rely in part on some of the legal arguments then-President Bill Clinton\\'s lawyers made when he was accused in a 1994 federal court lawsuit over an alleged sexual assault.

The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for the First Judicial Department rejected Trump\\'s challenge to a defamation lawsuit brought by a former contestant on The Apprentice, Summer Zervos. Although the US Supreme Court ruled in 1997 that then-president Bill Clinton could be sued in federal court, the justices left open the question of what was allowed in state court. \"Despite the suggestion in his brief that he is the \\'embodi[ment of] the Executive Branch,\\' and though he is tasked with significant responsibilities, the President is still a person, and he is not above the law,\" Judge Dianne Renwick wrote in the majority opinion. The appeals court upheld a lower court judge\\'s decision in March 2018 denying Trump\\'s efforts to have the case dismissed. Trump\\'s personal attorney in the case, Marc Kasowitz, said in a statement that they plan to appeal to the Court of Appeals, which is New York\\'s highest state court. A ruling from that court can be appealed to the US Supreme Court. \"We respectfully disagree with the majority decision in the Appellate Division. We believe that the well-reasoned dissenting opinion by 2 of the 5 justices, citing the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Clinton v. Jones case, is correct in concluding that the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution bars state courts from hearing cases against the President while he or she is in office,\" Kasowitz said. Zervos\\'s lawyer Mariann Wang said in a statement that they were \"very pleased that the First Department has affirmed once again that Defendant \\'is not above the law.\\'\" \"The case has proceeded in the trial court and discovery continues. We look forward to proving to a jury that Ms. Zervos told the truth about Defendant’s unwanted sexual groping and holding him accountable for his malicious lies,\" Wang said. At a press conference in October 2016, Zervos claimed that years before he was president, Trump on two separate occasions kissed her against her will and groped her, once in his office and another time at a hotel when they met for dinner. Trump denied there was any inappropriate sexual activity, and repeatedly charged that the women accusing him of bad acts were lying. Zervos filed a defamation lawsuit in New York Supreme Court in January 2017.  Renwick wrote that the supremacy clause of the US Constitution — which generally says that when state and federal law conflict, federal law prevails — did not override a state court\\'s authority to decide cases under the state\\'s own constitution. There is no federal law that conflicts with the defamation claims that Zervos brought against Trump, the judge wrote. Like the Clinton case in the 1990s, Zervos\\'s lawsuit involves \"purely unofficial acts,\" Renwick wrote. There were practical policy reasons why presidents were immune from lawsuits challenging their official decisions, she said, but Congress had never passed a law extending that immunity to personal behavior. Once the case went forward, Renwick wrote that there were ways for the trial judge to limit how much the case might interfere with the president\\'s duties — setting clear ground rules for the president\\'s involvement in the exchange of evidence and allowing the president to testify by video, for instance. Judge Angela Mazzarelli, who dissented on the constitutional issue and was joined by one other judge from the five-person panel, raised concerns about the court\\'s ability to hold a sitting president in contempt. Renwick said contempt wasn\\'t at issue now, and a court would deal with it later if it did. She did write, however, that it was \"likely\" that holding a president in contempt would be the type of \"impermissible \\'direct control\\'\" that the Supreme Court warned against in the Clinton case. The appeals court also rejected Trump\\'s other challenges to Zervos\\'s lawsuit. The court found that Trump\\'s allegations that his accusers were liars was a statement of fact that could be proven true or false, as opposed to opinion that couldn\\'t be the subject of a defamation case. \"Here, defendant\\'s denial of plaintiff\\'s allegations of sexual misconduct is susceptible of being proven true or false, since he either did or did not engage in the alleged behavior,\" Renwick wrote.\\n \\n\\t\\nPresident Donald Trump has put on some pounds and is now officially considered obese.\\nThe White House on Thursday released results of his most recent physical, revealing that his Body Mass Index is now 30.4. That\\'s based on the fact that he\\'s now carrying 243 pounds on his 6-foot, 3-inch frame. That\\'s up from 236 pounds in September 2016 before he became president.\\nAn index rating of 30 is the level at which doctors consider someone obese under this commonly used formula. About 40 percent of Americans are obese, and that raises their risk for heart disease, diabetes, stroke and some forms of cancer.\\nTrump, doesn\\'t drink alcohol or smoke, but he\\'s not a big fan of the gym either. His primary form of exercise is golf. And he says he gets plenty of walking in around the White House complex.\\nAs for his diet, Trump\\'s love of fast food remains. Last month, he invited the college football champion Clemson Tigers to the White House during the partial government shutdown. With the White House kitchen too understaffed to cater a meal, Trump stepped in: He ordered burgers, french fries and pizza.\\nDespite gaining four pounds from last year, Dr. Sean Conley, the president\\'s physician, said the 72-year-old president \"remains in very good health overall.\"\\nHis resting heart rate is 70 beats a minute and his blood pressure reading was 118 over 80, well within the normal range.\\n\\n\\tU.S. & World\\n\\tNews from around the country and around the globe\\n\\t\\n\\t \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nConley said routine lab tests were performed and Trump\\'s liver, kidney and thyroid functions are all normal as were his electrolytes and blood counts.

Trump went to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center last week for his second periodic physical, which lasted about four hours. During his exam, he received a flu shot and an inoculation to help prevent shingles, a viral infection that causes a painful rash.\\n\"I performed and supervised the evaluation with a panel of 11 different board-certified specialists,\" Conley wrote in a memorandum to the White House. \"He did not undergo any procedures requiring sedation or anesthesia.\"\\nHis cholesterol reading improved since last year.\\nAt his physical in January 2018, his total cholesterol was 223, which his higher than recommended, even though he was taking a low dose of the statin drug Crestor to help lower so-called \"bad\" cholesterol and fats. Last year, his doctor said he would increase that dose in an effort to get Trump\\'s bad cholesterol reading of 143 down below 120.\\nNow, Trump\\'s total cholesterol is down to 196, yet his LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol is 122 — slightly elevated. Conley said he planned to increase the dosage of a statin drug to 40 milligrams a day to bring the president\\'s cholesterol reading down further.\\nDr. Robert Eckel, a former American Heart Association president and cardiologist at the University of Colorado, said he would aim for an LDL below 100.\\n\"Losing some weight would help modify some of the risk factors for heart disease,\" Eckel said. \"A 20 to 25-pound weight loss would be what I\\'d recommend if he were my patient. And that\\'s not a quick fix.\"\\xa0\\n\\t \\n\\tThe White House released details of President Donald Trump\\'s annual physical with Dr. Sean Conley.

View Magazine   \\n\\tFor most his presidency, Donald Trump has demonstrated a perverse infatuation with the tyrannical despots who represent some of America’s most virulent enemies. From Vladimir Putin to Xi Jinping to Kim Jong Un to Muhammad Salman, Trump has shown an adoring preference for their brand of autocracy, and a deference to their flagrant lies over the facts provided by his own intelligence agencies.\\n \\n  \\nThe compulsion by Trump to emulate these dictators has not been incidental. He has explicitly expressed his aspiration to command the same blind loyalty that these authoritarians insist upon. He “ pined over Xi .” becoming president for life. He  yearned to be “worshipped”  like Kim. He has  spoken openly about “revolution”   if he is impeached.\\nNow Trump has elaborated on these anti-democratic, un-American tendencies in an interview with the ultra-rightist Breitbart website. Rather than show respect for the diversity of opinion in American politics, Trump has articulated an approach to his critics that is overtly hostile and illegal. He  told Breitbart  that:\\n  “I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump – I have the tough people, but they don’t play it tough — until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.”  \\nThat is an unambiguous threat of the sort that mobsters (with whom Trump is well familiar) would make against their foes. But it’s even worse than that.Trump is asserting that he personally has control of the police and the military and that they will obey his singular will. That’s the talk of a crazed, third world strongman, not a democratic president. Who is he proposing to attack with this fantasy force he’s pretending to command? Nancy Pelosi? Gavin Newsom? Robert Mueller?\\nAnd for some extra added totalitarian flavor, Trump insults the very troops that he thinks are his allies. He associates the police and the military with outlaw biker gangs who have no law enforcement authority, but whom Trump regards as part of his loony defense force.\\nThese are the martinets of the Trump regime who he expects will bear arms against their fellow citizens. It’s all part of his campaign to divide America into hostile factions. And anyone not on his side will be maligned in Stalinist terms as “the enemy of the people,” just has he as already been doing for years to our nation’s free press. He will be the one source of truth and the one commander of his twisted anti-patriots.

Attorney General William Barr was also at the President’s veto event.\\n \\n \\n While some lawmakers – including some Republicans – have argued against the President’s use of national emergency powers in this instance, the Justice Department set forth a robust defense of the President’s authority to do so in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell earlier this month, according to a copy obtained by CNN on Friday. \\n \\n \\n “The President acted well within his discretion in declaring a national emergency concerning the southern border,” wrote Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd, setting out the legal basis for the proclamation under the National Emergencies Act and additional statutory authorities, which largely tracks an internal memo issued by the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department.\\n \\n \\n “The President’s emergency Proclamation reasonably described the current situation as an ongoing ‘border security and humanitarian crisis,’” Boyd adds. “The crisis at the border … may qualify as an emergency even though it, too, is not entirely new.”\\n \\n \\n Twelve Republican senators banded together Thursday to deliver the forceful rebuke after expressing concerns that Trump’s use of the national emergency declaration as an end-run around Congress violates the separation of powers and sets a bad precedent that a would-be future Democratic president could follow to unilaterally drive their agenda.\\n \\n \\n The White House sought to pare back Republican defections leading up to the vote, with the President and White House aides making clear to Republican senators that a vote against Trump on this issue would have ramifications come re-election time.\\n \\n \\n Trump rejected entreaties from several Senate Republicans to agree to a compromise that would curtail his national emergency powers and instead framed the vote not as a matter of constitutional concerns, but rather as a litmus test on border security.\\n \\n \\n The approach – particularly the threats of re-election repercussions – stemmed defections from several Republicans up for re-election in 2020, but ultimately failed to stop the Senate from passing the resolution.\\n \\n \\n Trump tweeted about the political advantage he expects those who supported him will receive.\\n \\n \\n “I’d like to thank all of the Great Republican Senators who bravely voted for Strong Border Security and the WALL. This will help stop Crime, Human Trafficking, and Drugs entering our Country. Watch, when you get back to your State, they will LOVE you more than ever before!” Trump tweeted Friday. \\n \\n \\n Trump’s veto sends the resolution back to the US House of Representatives, which is expected to pick it up after the week-long congressional recess. The House is not expected to have the two-thirds of the chamber’s support needed to override the President’s veto. \\n \\n \\n This story has been updated with additional developments Friday.\\n \\n   WASHINGTON — The Senate voted 59-41 on Thursday to cancel President Donald Trump\\'s national security declaration to fund a wall on the border, as 12 Republicans joined Democrats in an unusual rebuke of the president. Trump has vowed to veto the measure, which would block him from making an end run around Congress to obtain billions of federal dollars that have been set aside for other purposes to build the wall he has promised along the border with Mexico. The vote could play a role in coming lawsuits challenging the emergency declaration. Before the vote, nine Republican senators said they would support the measure: Jerry Moran of Kansas, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Rob Portman of Ohio, Mike Lee of Utah, Mitt Romney of Utah, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Susan Collins of Maine. The number of GOP defections grew when the final votes were tallied to include Marco Rubio of Florida, Roy Blunt of Missouri and Roger Wicker of Mississippi. Moran and Alexander have announced that they don\\'t plan to seek re-election next year, while Collins is up for re-election in 2020. Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., conceded last week that the resolution would clear the 51-vote threshold needed to pass.     After the measure passed, Trump tweeted simply: The measure, passed by the House of Representatives in February, now heads to Trump\\'s desk. It would be the first veto of his presidency. Earlier at the White House, the president told reporters that the result of the vote didn\\'t matter. \"I’ll probably have to veto and it’s not going to be overturned, and we’re going to have our whole thing,\" he said. He added, \"The legal scholars all say it’s totally constitutional. It’s very important, it’s really a border security vote. It’s pure and simple — it’s a vote for border security, it’s a vote for no crime.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement after the measure passed that Trump\\'s declaration \"is an unlawful power grab that does violence to the Constitution and fundamentally alters the separation of powers.\" \"This is not an emergency, and the Congress has declared in a strong bipartisan voice that the President’s fearmongering doesn’t make it one,\" Pelosi said. In a tweet Thursday morning seemingly aimed at swaying lawmakers on the fence, Trump said that if Congress wanted to \"update the law\" that grants the president power to declare a national emergency, \"I will support those efforts, but today’s issue is BORDER SECURITY and Crime!!! Don\\'t vote with Pelosi!\" Romney, a frequent Trump critic, said that he would vote in favor of the resolution because of the broader implication of Trump\\'s declaration, which the president wants to use to pay for a border wall Congress has refused to fund. \"I will vote today for the resolution of disapproval,\" Romney said. \"This is a vote for the constitution and for the balance of powers that is at its core. For the executive branch to override a law passed by Congress would make it the ultimate power rather than a balancing power.\" He added, \"This is not a vote against border security. In fact, I agree that a physical barrier is urgently needed to help ease the humanitarian crisis at the southern border, and the administration already has $4.5 billion available within existing authority to fund a barrier — even without an emergency declaration.\" Alexander, in announcing on the Senate floor that he would support the measure, called the declaration a \"dangerous precedent.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., slammed Trump for declaring an emergency \"because he lost with Congress.\" \"He had to trample on the Constitution to continue his fight,\" Schumer said. Should Trump follow through on his veto threat, it is unlikely that Congress would be able to overturn it. Trump declared the national emergency weeks after the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, lasting more than a month, which followed Congress\\' refusal to acquiesce to his demand for more than $5 billion in funding to build a massive wall along the southern border with Mexico. Trump used the emergency declaration in hopes of redirecting billions of federal dollars to build the wall without congressional approval. Trump on Thursday labeled the Democratic lawmakers opposed to his emergency declaration \"\\'Border Deniers.\\'\" \"They refuse to see or acknowledge the Death, Crime, Drugs and Human Trafficking at our Southern Border!\" he tweeted.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n CNN\\n \\xa0—\\xa0\\n \\n\\n \\n President Donald Trump has nominated US Air Force General Tod Wolters to lead US European Command and be the top general overseeing NATO operations on the continent.\\n \\n \\n NATO’s North Atlantic Council has also agreed to appoint Wolters as Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, according to a statement issued by NATO.\\n \\n \\n His nomination must be confirmed by the Senate.\\n \\n \\n Wolters is currently serving as the commander of US Air Forces in Europe and US Air Forces Africa, a post he has held since 2016, overseeing air operations on both continents.\\n \\n \\n \\n A graduate of the Air Force Academy and former F-15 pilot, Wolters has had numerous operational deployments during the first Gulf War and post 9/11 conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\\n \\n \\n He will replace US Army Gen.

The post has always been held by a US officer.\\n \\n \\n He will only be the fourth Air Force officer to hold the post of NATO Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, a post first held by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.\\n \\n \\n Trump has long been critical of the 29-member military alliance, blasting allies for not spending enough on defense.\\n \\n \\n However despite these criticisms the US has increased its military presence in Europe during the Trump administration as the US and Europe seek to counter Russia following Moscow’s 2014 intervention in Ukraine.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n Approximately 93.3 million Americans are considered to be obese, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates. Now, President Donald Trump is among them. Dr. Sean P. Conley, the President’s physician, released the results of Trump’s annual physical on Thursday evening — almost a week after the examination. According to the memorandum obtained by TIME, the Commander in Chief is 6 foot 3 inches tall, weighs 243 pounds, has a resting heart rate of 70 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 118/80. His new height and weight ratio indicates a body mass index of 30.4, according to CDC guidelines. Anything above 30 is considered obesity. The results also show Trump has gained four pounds since January 2018, and was prescribed an increased dosage of rosuvastatin, which is used to treat high cholesterol and prevent heart disease. Even so, Conley indicated Trump was in “very good health overall.” But Dr. Gary LeRoy, a practicing family physician in Dayton, Ohio and the president-elect of the American Academy of Family Physicians, tells TIME that if somebody with health stats like the President’s wanted to establish himself as a new patient with his practice, they’d have to have a serious talk about lifestyle choices. “With his age, with his height and weight,” he says, “his body mass index would be concerning to me.” Though LeRoy has never examined Trump and cannot specifically address someone’s overall health without doing so, he did say the statistics indicate excellent blood pressure and a strong resting heart rate. Anything between 60 and 100 bpm is considered healthy, he says. Still, if the President were his patient, “we’d be having a conversation about his body mass index and lifestyle,” LeRoy says. “His diet, what types of activities he does. Is he living a very sedentary lifestyle? Is he living a very stressful lifestyle?” In the past, Trump has admitted he does not follow exercise regimes, outside of golf and running to meetings. But LeRoy says golf is not a very effective workout unless the participant is walking between holes. “Golf is not an aerobic exercise, because you’re not doing something for 20 to 30 minutes with sustained elevation of your heart rate,” he says. “Riding around in a golf cart is not going to be a good form of cardiovascular exercise.” Trump is also known for eating fast food. When he invited Clemson University’s football team to the White House last month to celebrate their national championship win, he served burgers and fries from several national chains. At one point during his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump scarfed down 2,530 calories worth of McDonald’s, his former campaign manager said. However, CNN reported last May that the President was attempting to make changes to his diet in an effort to shed pounds. \\n LeRoy says it’s easy to skip workouts and eat junk food from time to time, but the consequences tend to be more problematic as you age. “A person at 72 is reaching the average life expectancy of a male in this country,” he says, adding that the national average for men is about 76 years old. Because of that, LeRoy says it’s important for people over 50 to keep in mind personal risk factors like family histories of heart disease, cancer and other medical maladies. The President, however, maintains that he doesn’t have to worry about that. “I have good genes,” he’s declared.

In response to the question, Trump initially denied that his policy was cruel, before he then acknowledged that his policies are hurting people. \"No, I don\\'t think they\\'re cruel, I think they\\'re the opposite of cruel,\" he said. \"They become cruel because they\\'re so ridiculous and it hurts people. It actually does the reverse of what they\\'re supposed to be doing. But no, they\\'re actually meant to be the opposite. And they\\'re hurting people, they\\'re really hurting people. A lot of people.\" The reporter tried to get a second question in, but Trump cut him off. \"I think we\\'re doing an incredible job,\" he said. \"We\\'re apprehending record numbers of people. But if we had border security and we had the wall, if we had a proper wall, which we\\'re building now as we speak, and we\\'re getting a lot more funding for it, as you know, with what we\\'re talking about with the vote today, whether it\\'s positive or not, I\\'m vetoing it, unless I don\\'t have to veto, I think that\\'s unlikely, I\\'ll do a veto, it\\'s not going to be overturned. But we have done a great job at the border through apprehension.\"  Watch the video below.      Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice, can proceed with her defamation lawsuit against President Trump, a New York appellate court ruled Thursday, rejecting the president’s assertion he cannot be sued in state court. The decision means the president may have to sit for a sworn deposition, which is currently scheduled for June. The New York State Appellate Division’s First Department turned down Trump’s argument that the case should be halted until he is out of office because, as a sitting president, he was immune from a lawsuit brought in state court. “We reject defendant President Trump\\'s argument that the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution prevents a New York State court - and every other state court in the country - from exercising its authority under its state constitution,” the judges wrote. “Instead, we find that the Supremacy Clause was never intended to deprive a state court of its authority to decide cases and controversies under the state\\'s constitution.”     Summer Zervos is pictured at a press conference in Los Angeles on Jan. 17, 2017, and President Donald Trump walks on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Oct. 31, 2018. AFP/Getty Images     Zervos was among 19 women who publicly accused Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign of sexual misconduct dating back years earlier. He denied the allegations and called the women liars, which prompted Zervos to sue for defamation. “We are very pleased that the First Department has affirmed once again that Defendant is not above the law,” Zervos’ attorney Mariann Wang said in a statement. “We look forward to proving to a jury that Ms. Zervos told the truth about Defendant’s unwanted sexual groping and holding him accountable for his malicious lies.” President Trump’s attorneys have argued his words were opinions and protected speech made during the course of a competitive campaign. In a statement, one of the president\\'s attorneys, Marc Kasowitz, said they \"respectfully disagree\" with the decision. \"We believe that the well-reasoned dissenting opinion by 2 of the 5 justices, citing the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Clinton v. Jones case, is correct in concluding that the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution bars state courts from hearing cases against the President while he or she is in office,\" Kasowitz said in the statement. \"We will seek to appeal the majority decision to New York’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, which we expect will agree with the dissent.” Zervos has said Trump made unwanted sexual advances towards her, which he has denied. The first allegedly occurred in Trump’s office in 2007 when he kissed her. The second allegedly occurred soon thereafter when Zervos went to meet Trump for dinner at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where she said he kissed her \"open-mouthed,\" \"grabbed her shoulder, again kissing her very aggressively, and placed his hand on her breast.\" Zervos filed her defamation lawsuit three days before Trump\\'s inauguration. The trial judge has allowed discovery to move forward while the president’s appeal was pending. A deposition has been scheduled for some time before the end of June.  \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\ncontent=morelink&utm_campaign=syndication\">Gallup poll released Thursday shows Donald Trump with just a 39 percent approval rating, marking the first time in months that it has dropped below 40 percent. It also shows that his approval has dropped 4 points in a month. His approval rating was 43 percent in the second half of February.\\xa0The president’s approval rating in the Gallup Poll has consistently been at around 40 percent for most of his presidency.\\nThere Has Been Nothing But Bad News for Donald Trump\\nTrump has had a month full of bad news, including:\\n\\nAn unsuccessful summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, \\nHis former personal attorney Michael Cohen giving incriminating testimony to House committees, \\nA disappointing jobs report for March,\\nReports of record trade deficits, and\\nDefeats in Congress on his border wall and other issues.\\n\\nTrump’s approval rating is kept as high as it is because of support from his own party. In the new poll 90 percent of Republicans gave him positive marks for his performance. However, Gallup has also documented a steady decline in the number of Americans who consider themselves Republicans. Less than 25% of American voters now self-identify as members of the GOP.\\nTrump’s biggest trouble lies with independents, and just 33 percent of them said they approve of Trump. Unsurprisingly, only four percent of Democrats said they have a favorable opinion of the president’s job performance.\\nThe poll was completed on March 10, after a series of events occurred which have harmed the president’s political standing.\\nMore Bad News Is Coming For Donald Trump\\nIt is expected that the bad new for Donald Trump will continue in the coming weeks. Today he is expected to face a crushing defeat in the Senate, which is poised to support a bill passed by the House which condemns Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border.\\nYesterday the president’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort received the second of two sentences for his convictions on over 20 criminal charges. Manafort will now be facing over seven years in a federal prison. Another Trump aide, his former lawyer Michael Cohen, is also spending time in federal prison.\\nAnd hanging over Trump’s head is the highly anticipated report from special counsel Robert Mueller which is expected to be released soon. The president may also be facing the prospect of seeing his own children be the subject of criminal indictments. \\nThe Republican Party Is a Disaster\\nIn spite of all of this, fully 90 percent of Republicans still support Trump and think he is doing a good job. That is all you need to know about the current state of the Republican Party.\\nThe GOP, like the presidency of Donald Trump, is a complete disaster. All signs are now pointing to another Big Blue Wave for the Democratic Party in next year’s elections.\\n \\n     I am a lifelong Democrat with a passion for social justice and progressive issues. I have degrees in writing, economics and law from the University of Iowa.  \\n\\t   \\n\\tPresident Donald Trump said a possible pardon for Paul Manafort “is not something on my mind” after his former campaign chair’s prison sentence was raised to 7½ years on Wednesday.\\n“I feel very badly for Paul Manafort,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “On a human basis, it is a very sad thing.”\\nWhen asked about a possible pardon, Trump said: “I haven’t even given it a thought as of this moment. It is not something on my mind.”\\n\\t \\n\\t\\n\\n\\tKEYWORDS\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\tIn a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.\\n\\t SUBSCRIBE NOW\\n \\n\\t  China and the U.S. are looking to push an earlier scheduled meeting between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping to at least April, according to a Bloomberg report that cited unnamed sources.  Trump said on Wednesday he was in no rush to complete a trade pact with China and insisted that any deal should include protection for intellectual property, a major sticking point between the two sides during months of negotiations. Trump and Xi had been expected to hold a summit at Mar-a-Lago in Florida later this month, but no date had been set for a meeting and no in-person talks between their trade teams have been held in more than two weeks. The Bloomberg report quoted a source saying that Xi’s staff have stopped planning for a U.S. trip, following his visit to Europe later this month. A spokesperson for the White House didn’t immediately comment when contacted by CNBC. Earlier this month, nuclear talks between Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un were cut short after the two sides failed to reach an agreement — a diplomatic snafu that has led Chinese officials to grow worried Trump could do the same in trade talks, a senior administration official told CNBC last week. “The Chinese saw him walk away from North Korea and they’re concerned he will walk away from the China deal,” the official said. “You don’t want to send Xi to Mar-a-Lago and have Trump walk away. That would be a diplomatic catastrophe.” To ensure such a summit would not follow the same fallout as the nuclear talks in Hanoi, the official said Beijing and Washington are going through “line-by-line negotiations.” “What they don’t want is to send their guy here and POTUS says ‘nope I’m out of here, see you on the 9th hole,’” the official said.  \\nTrump’s lawyers argued that allowing such a suit to proceed in a state court would interfere with his responsibilities as president under the Constitution, but a trial judge rejected that argument and on Thursday the majority of the appeals panel agreed.\\n“Defendant’s interpretation conflicts with the fundamental principle that the United States has a ‘government of laws and not of men,’” Justice Dianne Renwick wrote inan opinion joined by Justices Troy Webber and Cynthia Kern.\\nRenwick explained that Trump’s legal team argument that the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause — which gives federal laws precedence over state laws — should prevent the Zervos suit from proceeding had no support in the Constitution or prior case law. \\nRenwick declared that there is nothing in the Constitution or prior case law to support the Trump legal team’s argument that the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause — which generally gives federal laws precedence over state laws — bars a state court from exercising jurisdiction over the president.\\nTrump lawyer Marc Kasowitz vowed an appeal.\\n“We will seek to appeal the majority decision to New York’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, which we expect will agree with the dissent,” Kasowitz said.\\nAn attorney for Zervos, Mariann Wang, hailed the ruling and said it meant fact-finding could proceed. As part of that process, Trump could be made to submit to a deposition by the end of June.\\n“We are very pleased that the [court] has affirmed once again that Defendant ‘is not above the law,’” Wang said. “We look forward to proving to a jury that Ms. Zervos told the truth about Defendant’s unwanted sexual groping and holding him accountable for his malicious lies.”\\nThe arguments Trump’s attorneys leveled against Zervos were based largely on an issue left unresolved in a 1997 U.S. Supreme Court decision that resulted from a lawsuit Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee, filed against President Bill Clinton for sexual harassment. The justices unanimously voted to allow that suit to proceed, but noted it was filed in federal court, unlike the Zervos suit.\\nIn a footnote, the high court said a state court suit would present different concerns, but the ruling did not offer a conclusion on that point.\\nRenwick’s decision said that brief mention wasn’t enough to shut down Zervos’ suit.\\n“Contrary to defendant’s contention, Clinton v Jones did not suggest that its reasoning would not apply to state court actions. It merely identified a potential constitutional concern,” she wrote. “Notwithstanding that concern, this Court should not be deterred from holding that a state court can exercise jurisdiction over the President as a defendant in a civil lawsuit.”\\nCiting the president’s wide-ranging and urgent responsibilities, the two judges who dissented on Thursday said they would have granted Trump’s motion to put the case on hold as long as he remains president.\\n“The question … becomes whether this all-consuming nature of the Presidency creates a constitutional barrier to defendant’s susceptibility to suit in state court ...

I don\\'t know enough about it yet. But it\\'s certainly a terrible thing.\" Trump was asked about white nationalism and the shooting deaths of 49 people at mosques in Christchurch after he formally vetoed Congress\\' resolution to block his declaration of a national emergency at the Mexico border. His veto, aimed at freeing money to build more miles of a border wall against illegal immigration, is expected to survive any congressional effort to overturn it. Questioned about the accused gunman\\'s reference to him, Trump professed ignorance. \"I didn\\'t see it. I didn\\'t see it,\" he said. \"But I think it\\'s a horrible event ... a horrible, disgraceful thing and a horrible act.\"  MPR News is not just a listener supported source of information, it\\'s a resource where listeners are supported. We take you beyond the headlines to the world we share in Minnesota. Become a sustainer today to fuel MPR News all year long.  The man accused of the shootings, whose name was not immediately released, left behind a lengthy document that outlined his motivations. He proudly stated that he was a 28-year-old Australian white nationalist who hates immigrants and was set off by attacks in Europe that were perpetrated by Muslims. In a single reference, he mentioned the U.S. president. \"Were/are you a supporter of Donald Trump?\" was one of the questions he posed to himself. His answer: \"As a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose? Sure. As a policy maker and leader? Dear god no.\" The White House immediately denounced the connection. But the mention from the suspect, who embraced Nazi imagery and voiced support for fascism, nonetheless cast an uncomfortable light on the way that the president has been embraced by some on the far right. Trump, who as a candidate proposed a ban on all Muslims entering the United States, has drawn criticism as being slow to condemn white supremacy and related violence. After a 2017 clash between white nationalists and anti-racist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one demonstrator dead, Trump said there were \"very fine people on both sides\" of the confrontation. He also did not immediately reject the support of David Duke, a former KKK Grand Wizard, during his presidential campaign. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., tied Trump\\'s inflammatory language to the violence half a world away. \"Words have consequences like saying we have an invasion on our border and talking about people as though they were different in some fatal way,\" Blumenthal said on CNN. \"I think that the public discourse from the president on down is a factor in some of these actions.\" Former Texas Rep. Beto O\\'Rourke, who declared his Democratic candidacy for president this week, said, \"We must call out this hatred, this Islamophobia, this intolerance, and the violence that predictably follows from the rhetoric that we use.\"   Ambulance staff take a man from outside a mosque in central Christchurch, New Zealand, Friday. Mark Baker | AP   The White House, in comments before those remarks, rejected any link to Trump. \"It\\'s outrageous to even make that connection between this deranged individual that committed this evil crime to the president who has repeatedly condemned bigotry, racism and made it very clear that this is a terrorist attack,\" Mercedes Schlapp, the White House\\'s director of strategic communication, told reporters. \"We are there to support and stand with the people of New Zealand.\" Trump himself telephoned New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, offering condolences, prayers and any help the U.S. might be able to provide. She told reporters she answered, \"My message was: to offer sympathy and love to all Muslim communities.\" Trump\\'s hardline immigration rhetoric and calls to return America to its traditional past have been embraced by many on the conservative fringes, including some who troll online with racist imagery, as well as white supremacists who have looked to engage in violence. In Florida, Cesar Sayoc, who had decorated his van with Trump propaganda, was accused of mailing explosives last fall to Democratic Party officials and media members, many of whom had been criticized by the president. The president said Sayoc had been \"insane\" long before he became a Trump fan. Last month, a former Coast Guard official was accused of stockpiling weapons in a plot to kill media members and liberal politicians as part of a plan to transform the U.S. into a white ethno-state. It took more than a week for Trump to respond to the plot, which he deemed \"a shame.\" Many experts who track violent extremists have identified white nationalism as a growing threat in the U.S. and abroad. In January, for example, the New York-based Anti-Defamation League said that domestic extremists killed at least 50 people in the U.S. in 2018, up from 37 in 2017, and said, \"White supremacists were responsible for the great majority of the killings, which is typically the case.\" Some critics have accused U.S. authorities of not dedicating adequate resources to stem a threat of domestic terrorism. However, The Washington Post reported last week that internal FBI data showed more domestic terror suspects were arrested last year than those allegedly inspired by international terror groups.   NEW YORK (AP) — A former contestant on \"The Apprentice\" who accused President Donald Trump of unwanted kissing and groping can move forward with her defamation lawsuit against him, a state appeals court ruled Thursday, raising the prospect that a sitting president could be called for sworn questioning. A panel of judges on the Supreme Court Appellate Division said in their ruling, in a case brought by Summer Zervos, that the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution doesn\\'t require trials in state court to be delayed until the president is out of office. Citing a U.S. Supreme Court ruling two decades ago in a case involving alleged sexual misconduct by President Bill Clinton, a majority of judges on the panel said presidents can be sued in state courts over things they did that aren\\'t related to their official duties. \"The current sitting President attempts to shield himself from consequences for his alleged unofficial misconduct by relying upon the constitutional protection of the Presidency,\" the judges said in an opinion written by Justice Dianne T. Renwick. \"We reject defendant President Trump\\'s argument that the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution prevents a New York State court — and every other state court in the country — from exercising its authority under its state constitution. Instead, we find that the Supremacy Clause was never intended to deprive a state court of its authority to decide cases and controversies under the state\\'s constitution.\" The decision, which increases the prospect that Trump could have to sit for sworn questioning in the lawsuit, was not unanimous. Two of the five justices on the panel, Peter Tom and Angela M. Mazzarelli, said in a dissent, written by Mazzarelli, that subjecting the president to a state trial court\\'s jurisdiction \"interferes with his ability to carry out his constitutional duty of executing the laws of the United States.\" Trump\\'s lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said he planned to appeal to New York\\'s highest court. \"We believe that the well-reasoned dissenting opinion by 2 of the 5 justices, citing the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Clinton v. Jones case, is correct in concluding that the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution bars state courts from hearing cases against the President while he or she is in office,\" he wrote. Zervos was among over a dozen women who came forward during Trump\\'s 2016 campaign with allegations of sexual misconduct years earlier. He called the women \"liars\" trying to harm his campaign with \"100 percent fabricated\" stories, and he retweeted a message specifically calling Zervos\\' claim \"a hoax.\" He also issued a statement denying it. Trump\\'s lawyers have said the case shouldn\\'t go forward while he is in office. They also say his remarks were opinions that he had a free-speech right to express in the course of a heated campaign. Zervos\\' lawyers said Trump\\'s words were factual falsehoods that subjected her to threats and cost her business at her Southern California restaurant. Zervos appeared on \"The Apprentice\" in 2006, when Trump was the reality show\\'s host. She says he made the unwanted advances the next year during get-togethers she hoped would yield career advice. She says she didn\\'t go public with her allegations for almost a decade because she admired Trump as a businessman and thought he had had just a couple of episodes of bad behavior with her. Both Trump and Zervos are Republicans. Her resolve to stay quiet changed, she said, after an \"Access Hollywood\" recording emerged in October 2016 of Trump boasting about groping women. Zervos is seeking a retraction, an apology, and compensatory and punitive damages. Her lawyer, Mariann Wang, said in an emailed statements she was pleased the judges had ruled that Trump was \"not above the law.\" \"We look forward to proving to a jury that Ms. Zervos told the truth about Defendant\\'s unwanted sexual groping and holding him accountable for his malicious lies,\" she said. Both sides have continued gathering evidence while awaiting the appeals court\\'s decision. They face a June 28 deadline for any depositions — pretrial questioning under oath — of Trump and Zervos by each other\\'s lawyers.          American citizen Paul Whelan, suspected of espionage on behalf of the United States, attends a hearing at the Moscow City Court. (Photo: Vladimir Gerdo/TASS via Getty Images)    Paul and David Whelan, twins born in Canada who grew up in the United States, spent their 49th birthdays earlier this month very differently. David Whelan, a lawyer who specializes in information and technology, was diving into books about Russian negotiation tactics and using Google Translate to glean clues about how his brother got wrapped up in what he views as a fabricated spying scandal. Meanwhile, Paul Whelan turned a year older in Lefortovo Prison in Moscow. As Paul Whelan enters his third month of detention in Russia, his case stands as a counterpoint to President Donald Trump’s public boasting about his ability to get U.S. citizens detained abroad released. Trump, who in December announced his administration had freed 17 Americans, has hosted public events with returned Americans at the White House, most recently with Danny Burch, who recently returned from Yemen. But now, scrutiny is building over Trump’s handling of overseas hostages, particularly after he said that North Korea’s leader didn’t know about the treatment of Otto Warmbier, an American who was returned to the United States in a coma and died soon after. And Paul Whelan is becoming another sore spot on Trump’s record of returning Americans. David Whelan told Yahoo News that the family is pleased with the attention from the State Department’s Moscow consular service, but has barely heard any new information from U.S. officials in Washington. “It’s mind-boggling,” he said during an interview with Yahoo News. He said he was told by government officials that “sometimes the family doesn’t hear anything,” but he worries that the issue is slipping off the radar due to a lack of high-level public condemnation of Russian behavior.        Paul Whelan speaks with his lawyers before a court hearing in Moscow, Jan. 22, 2019. (Photo: Maxim Shemetov/Reuters)    David Whelan compared Paul Whelan’s case to those of the Ukrainian sailors who have been held by Russia since November 2018, and whose detention continues to be extended indefinitely. “The Russians have learned … they can really jerk people around and no one will do anything,” he said. Since Paul Whelan was arrested by the Russian FSB in Moscow on Dec. 28, 2018, and accused of espionage, the flurry of media and public attention has slowly faded. The FBI has questioned the groom at the wedding Paul was in town to attend, one source told Yahoo News, but little else is known about its investigation. But the lack of public statements from the U.S. government may be strategic, according to John Sipher, a former officer in the CIA’s Clandestine Service who served in Moscow. “The Russians hate when we publicize things and spin them up,” he said. “They prefer to work on these things quietly.” “The embassy and administration may be trying to appease and accommodate the Russians to see if it works, and may be holding off on escalation to see if it works,” he said. However, his family members not being provided information on Paul Whelan’s status and efforts to bring him home is odd, he said. “We should either see quiet success … or we should be doing loud pressure.” So far, however, there appears to have been neither. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in January said that the United States would seek additional information on Paul Whelan’s case and “if the detention is not appropriate, we will demand his immediate return.” However, there have been no public calls from the State Department or the White House demanding Whelan’s release, despite the lack of evidence presented by the Russian security services that he committed any sort of crime. A readout of Pompeo’s last call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Feb. 13 showed the two discussed the chemical weapon attack in Salisbury, England, the decaying International Monetary Fund treaty and Venezuela. But Whelan did not come up, according to the readout provided by State Department deputy spokesperson Robert Palladino.        Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. (Photo: Andre Coelho/Bloomberg via Getty Images)    A State Department spokesperson told Yahoo News that the State Department is “following Mr. Whelan’s case closely” and is pressuring the Russian government “to ensure fair trial guarantees.” However, “due to privacy considerations for Mr. Whelan and his family, we have nothing further at this time,” wrote the spokesperson. Most recently, the Russian court system extended Whelan’s detention three more months to allow for further investigation. Whelan carries passports from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland. Consular representatives from each of the four countries, as well as U.S. ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman, have managed to briefly visit him, despite obstacles presented by Russian security officials. There is some coordination between consular offices from the different countries to visit Whelan, according to one official familiar with the proceedings. A spokesperson for the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said “the department is continuing to provide consular assistance to an individual arrested in Moscow,” but the embassies of Canada and the United Kingdom did not respond to requests for comment. “British Embassy officials are providing consular assistance to a British man detained in Moscow and are in touch with the local authorities. Our staff in London are providing support to his family,” wrote a spokesperson for the British Embassy in Washington. Additionally, the family has been in touch with congressional offices, which, after some pressure, have begun publishing more statements in support of Whelan. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., posted a tweet in honor of Paul Whelan’s birthday, advocating for his release, and Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, put out a press release demanding Whelan have access to consular officials, an attorney of his choice, and his family.   Yesterday American citizen Paul Whelan spent his birthday detained in Russia. He should be released and allowed to reunite with his family. — Senator Rubio Press (@SenRubioPress) March 6, 2019    However, it’s still difficult for the representatives to get into detail. Multiple congressional offices the Whelan family has been in touch with declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. One of the reasons for silence on the Whelan case is that he has been unable to sign a privacy waiver, which would allow the State Department to speak publicly about the specific details of his case, according to his family. There has also been discussion, on the part of the Russian attorney representing Whelan, as well as other U.S. experts, speculating that Whelan could be traded for a prisoner Russia is interested in bringing back home. Russian officials have repeatedly called for the release of Maria Butina, who pled guilty to being an unregistered foreign agent, and, according to court records, is still assisting U.S. officials in ongoing cases. Though former intelligence officials who served in Russia have been adamant that Whelan does not fit the profile of an undercover spy, it’s possible he had some formal or informal role advising or assisting a U.S. or foreign partner intelligence service. Given that he was convicted in a 2008 court martial case for charges related to larceny and discharged from the Marines, and the fact that he is active on Russian social media, it may be unlikely that he is a spy. However, those things could add to a cover identity or throw suspecting parties off the scent, or could make him a potentially useful asset, i.e., someone who provides information to professional intelligence officers. “Do I think he’s an American spy breaking Russian laws? No,” wrote Irvin McCullough, a national security analyst for the Government Accountability Project. “But the United States Intelligence Community has long-standing relationships with business people like Paul Whelan.” The CIA’s National Resources Division often speaks to business people and other professionals about their trips abroad to gather information, McCullough pointed out. “Given Paul’s military and security background, his personal interest in Russia and his employer\\'s alleged connection to Russia, I’d be surprised if the CIA didn\\'t seek to debrief him once or twice,” he wrote. “That wouldn\\'t make him a spy — and it certainly wouldn\\'t give Russia cause to detain him like they have.”        Paul Whelan after a ruling regarding extension of his detention. (Photo: Shamil Zhumatov/Reuters)    The Whelan family has secured the pro bono assistance from Ryan Fayhee, a former Department of Justice attorney from within the counterespionage division. Fayhee tells Yahoo he was led to work with the Whelans because “they just frankly weren’t getting what they needed.” However, Chris Costa, the executive director of the International Spy Museum and a former counterterrorism adviser to Trump who worked directly on hostage recovery, says Whelan’s case falls squarely under the responsibilities of diplomats at the State Department. When he handled hostage cases, Costa says, he was called upon when an international terrorist or criminal group took an American prisoner, or an adversarial government captured an American and refused to acknowledge it, like in the case of Robert Levinson, the retired FBI agent who went missing in Iran in 2007. “In a case with someone suspected of espionage, it would be mostly the State Department,” he said. When asked whether the diplomatic channels have been sufficient, Costa replied, “I really do think it works. It’s imperfect, but it works.” He pointed to the Trump administration’s record of bringing Americans home. On Whelan’s case in particular, he said, “I do believe it’s being worked aggressively.” The White House, when asked about its assistance to Whelan including any assistance provided by those working on hostage cases, deferred comment to the State Department. Meanwhile, Whelan’s friends and family are hoping for a resolution soon. One friend of Whelan’s who served with him in the military, who asked not to be named due to the ongoing sensitivity of the case, recalled a time when a fellow serviceman was killed in action and he flew out to Michigan to attend the funeral. Whelan, who lived in Novi, a small city in Michigan west of Detroit, picked him up and drove him over five hours each way to the remote Michigan town where the funeral was held.        Photo: Shamil Zhumatov/Reuters    “Paul is a very caring person who has always gone far out of his way to look out for the welfare of others, particularly for U.S. military members,” recalled the friend. With Russia’s legal process moving forward, it’s unclear how long Whelan will be detained without an official U.S. government diplomatic response. And Fayhee, the attorney working pro bono for the Whelan family, says the safety of Americans overseas in the future is at risk if Russia is allowed to detain Whelan without consequence. If the United States doesn’t condemn Russian aggression, Fayhee argues that “it sets a very, very dangerous precedent.” _____  Read more from Yahoo News:     Women divided by race over key issues, but with areas of overlap     Some women are happy to let the march pass them by     Maverick Republican William Weld looks to run against Trump\\'s \\'malignant narcissism\\'     The Army\\'s killer drones: How a secretive special ops unit decimated ISIS     The Soviets wanted to infiltrate the Reagan camp.

PHOTOS: In Gaza, women walk thin line between hope and despair      US president Donald Trump has issued the first veto of his administration, blocking a measure that opposed his use of a national emergency to circumvent Congress in an effort to secure funds to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. Signing the veto on Friday, Mr Trump said the national emergency would provide “safety at the border”. William Barr, the recently appointed attorney general, said it was \"clearly authorised under the law\".   I’d like to thank all of the Great Republican Senators who bravely voted for Strong Border Security and the WALL. This will help stop Crime, Human Trafficking, and Drugs entering our Country. Watch, when you get back to your State, they will LOVE you more than ever before!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 15, 2019 \\n Earlier this week 12 Republicans joined with Democrats in the Senate to rebuke the president over his push to bypass Congress for a plan that many argue is a vanity project. The Democrat-controlled House of Representatives last week also opposed the national emergency declaration. The veto marks the latest attempt by the US president to advance construction of the border wall – a signature part of his 2016 election campaign that he has failed thus far to achieve. Mr Trump wants to secure a political win with the wall for the 2020 presidential race, but Democrats do not want to give him a victory. The battle between the White House and Congress illustrates how Republicans are growing a little more willing to challenge the president. While some oppose the wall, many of the Republicans who voted to disapprove the national emergency did so because they believed it usurped power from Congress. Some GOP members also warned that it would set a precedent that a future Democratic president could use to overcome Republican opposition to more liberal policies. Ahead of issuing the veto, Mr Trump thanked the Republican senators who did not support the congressional measure opposing the national emergency: “This will help stop Crime, Human Trafficking, and Drugs entering our Country. Watch, when you get back to your State, they will LOVE you more than ever before!” Congress needs a two-thirds majority in both houses to override the presidential veto – a hurdle that looks unlikely to clear in the Senate. Moving to the courts In a separate battle, several states across the US have sued the Trump administration over the national emergency, setting the stage for the courts to determine whether it is legal. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which has filed a lawsuit opposing the national emergency, criticised the veto, but said the move was irrelevant because the issue would be ultimately be decided by the courts. \"Even members of President Trump\\'s own party are beginning to realise that he is a one-man constitutional crisis,\" said Anthony Romero, executive director of ACLU. \"Congress has rejected the president\\'s declaration, and now the courts will be the ultimate arbiter of its legality. We look forward to seeing him in court and to the shellacking that he will receive at the hands of an independent judiciary.\" Trump’s budget Mr Trump has also signalled that he intends to fight even harder for border-wall funding later this year. Earlier this week he unveiled a budget for fiscal 2020 that requests $8.6 billion (€7.6 billion) for the wall. While Democrats – and some Republicans – described the budget as “dead on arrival”, the move signalled that Mr Trump intends to make the wall a core issue in his re-election campaign. At political rallies ahead of the midterm elections in November last year, Mr Trump urged supporters to chant “Finish that Wall” in an effort to convince his base that he had succeeded in building more wall on the border than his administration has actually done. From Kamala Harris, a senator from California, to former congressman Beto O\\'Rourke, several of the many Democratic presidential contenders are using the issue to criticise Mr Trump over his stance on immigration. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019  \\n\\t\\n\\tFebruary 14, 2019 - 9:28 pm\\t\\n\\t \\n\\t\\nWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has put on some pounds and is now officially considered obese.\\nThe White House on Thursday released results of his most recent physical, revealing that his Body Mass Index is now 30.4. That’s based on the fact that he’s now carrying 243 pounds on his 6-foot, 3-inch frame. That’s up from 236 pounds in September 2016 before he became president.\\nAn index rating of 30 is the level at which doctors consider someone obese under this commonly used formula. About 40 percent of Americans are obese, and that raises their risk for heart disease, diabetes, stroke and some forms of cancer.\\nTrump doesn’t drink alcohol or smoke, but he’s not a big fan of the gym either. His primary form of exercise is golf. And he says he gets plenty of walking in around the White House complex.\\nAs for his diet, Trump’s love of fast food remains. Last month, he invited the college football champion Clemson Tigers to the White House during the partial government shutdown. With the White House kitchen too understaffed to cater a meal, Trump stepped in: He ordered burgers, french fries and pizza.\\nDespite gaining four pounds from last year, Dr. Sean Conley, the president’s physician, said the 72-year-old president “remains in very good health overall.”\\nHis resting heart rate is 70 beats a minute and his blood pressure reading was 118 over 80, well within the normal range.\\nConley said routine lab tests were performed and Trump’s liver, kidney and thyroid functions are all normal as were his electrolytes and blood counts. An electrocardiogram, a test that measures electrical activity generated by the heart as it beats, remained unchanged from last year.\\n“Despite the fact that he’s obese, his blood pressure is normal,” said Dr. Mariell Jessup, the Heart Association’s chief science and medical officer.\\nUsing the association’s heart risk calculator, “he has a 17 percent chance of developing cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years,” mostly because of his age and slightly elevated bad cholesterol, she said.\\nModern-day presidents have undergone regular exams to catch any potential problems but also to assure the public that they are fit for office. Trump went to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center last week for his second periodic physical, which lasted about four hours. During his exam, he received a flu shot and an inoculation to help prevent shingles, a viral infection that causes a painful rash.\\n“I performed and supervised the evaluation with a panel of 11 different board-certified specialists,” Conley wrote in a memorandum to the White House. “He did not undergo any procedures requiring sedation or anesthesia.”\\nHis cholesterol reading improved since last year.\\nAt his physical in January 2018, his total cholesterol was 223, which his higher than recommended, even though he was taking a low dose of the statin drug Crestor to help lower so-called “bad” cholesterol and fats. Last year, his doctor said he would increase that dose in an effort to get Trump’s bad cholesterol reading of 143 down below 120.\\nNow, Trump’s total cholesterol is down to 196, yet his LDL or “bad” cholesterol is 122 — slightly elevated. Conley said he planned to increase the dosage of a statin drug to 40 milligrams a day to bring the president’s cholesterol reading down further.\\nDr. Robert Eckel, a former American Heart Association president and cardiologist at the University of Colorado, said he would aim for an LDL below 100.\\n“Losing some weight would help modify some of the risk factors for heart disease,” Eckel said. “A 20- to 25-pound weight loss would be what I’d recommend if he were my patient. And that’s not a quick fix.”\\n\\t  According to people whose lives may well have depended upon it, the late North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il had an excellent golf game. One story told of Kim’s golf prowess crossed the demilitarized zone and become something of a minor meme: that Kim, while playing the first round of golf of his life at the age of 52, shot a 38-under-par 34 at the Pyongyang Golf Course. It’s false, obviously, but not just for the obvious reasons. The actual story, as Golf.com’s Josh Sens told it in 2016, was that Kim’s caddy didn’t really know how to score golf, and so filled out the supreme leader’s scorecard with numbers that corresponded not to how many strokes Kim took, but how many strokes he was over par—zero for an even par, one for a bogey, and so on. Even that score is almost certainly bullshit, too, Sens writes—the Pyongyang course is a professional grade 7,700 yards, Kim was a 5-foot-3 man in his early fifties playing a very difficult sport for the first time, and just as a matter of best practices it’s wise to concede a putt here and there to someone who cares about these particular appearances that much.     Off English    Anyway, Donald Trump is good at golf. We know this because he brings it up a lot, and sometimes asks other people to bring it up so that he can hear the stories about himself all over again. Here he is making the CEO of General Electric tell a story about the time that they were playing golf together and Trump got a hole-in-one, right after saying, “I’m the best golfer of all the rich people.”  You can tell it’s a great story because of how hard every single one of the barnacles in suits sitting around the table dissolve into laughter when it’s over, and from the appreciative way that Trump says the words “it’s a crazy, it’s a crazy” once the tale is told. That’s why everyone says “it’s a crazy, it’s a crazy” now, whenever someone gets done telling a really good story. Donald Trump started that and then it just took off, like never before, even though he never gets any credit for it. Another way to tell that Donald Trump is a good golfer is that he has won 20 club championships, some of them overall men’s championships and some of them senior or super-senior championships and all of those at golf courses that Trump owns. The most recent of these, Golf.com reports, is a men’s championship from 2018, which Trump won at Trump International Golf Course. This is remarkable given that Trump is 72 years old—his last two championships at the course, in 2012 and 2013, were seniors titles—and played golf at one of his clubs a mere 76 times in 2018. It’s not out of the question that Trump could have won this title fair and square, as he is by wide acclaim considered to be the best golfer of all the rich people. Less-rich people that have played with Trump also say that he’s good. “Not real long in terms of hitting it a long distance,” in the words of Golf Digest reporter Jaime Diaz, who has played with Trump, “but he’s real straight and real consistent. So he’s always in play.” But also it’s just absolutely fucking out of the question that Trump won the title fair and square. Physically, the man looks like some sort of hideous British dessert—some sort of meringue that’s been boiled for a day inside a pair of men’s underpants and somehow tastes exactly like baloney—and stands like he’s in the middle of a windstorm. A thin rivulet of beige liquid has been leaking from his ears since at least 2014. He is plainly in no condition to win any golf club’s golf championship—or even, as Golf.com’s Michael Bamberger reports, a co-championship, a distinction that didn’t make it onto the little plaque that Trump had screwed onto his locker at Trump International. And yet the plaque is there, and Trump is listed as the co-champion alongside a 58-year-old Trump International club member named Ted Virtue.

Virtue held that title outright, Bamberger writes, until “Trump ran into him at the club, according to multiple sources who recounted the story. Having some fun with him, Trump said something like, ‘The only reason you won is because I couldn’t play.’” Trump challenged Virtue to a nine-hole match-play playoff—that is, each hole scored independently and worth one point—for the title. “As in nearly all amateur golf rounds, no rules official was on hand. Golf’s tradition calls for players to police themselves and, if necessary, one another. Trump won. In victory a magnanimous Trump said to Virtue something like, ‘This isn’t fair—we’ll be co-champions.’” And that’s the story of how Donald Trump won his 20th club championship. To a certain extent, the success or failure of every presidency depends upon working around the leader’s whims and weaknesses. The more whimsical and weak the leader, the more difficult it becomes to get anything done; the work of flattering and feeding what needs flattering and feeding subsumes everything else and the bulk of the leader’s need crowds everything else away from the light. That type of leader’s metastatic personal foibles can quickly become everyone’s problem and everyone’s business—they become actual national issues in their own right, as everything that the state is meant to do is constantly being suspended because there’s an urgent need to cajole or sweet-talk or threaten or bribe the car keys out of the hands of a man who is plainly in no shape to drive. Anyway I forget what I was driving at there, but congratulations to President Donald Trump on another big victory. Here is an inspirational quote from him about the game he loves: “I feel golf should be an aspirational game, something people aspire to [play],” Trump told Fortune Magazine in 2015. “People should come to golf, golf shouldn’t come to them. Let golf be elitist. When I say ‘aspire,’ that’s a positive word. Let people work hard and aspire to someday be able to play golf.”  \\n \\n NEW YORK — President Donald Trump played down any threat posed by racist white nationalism on Friday after the gunman accused of the New Zealand mosque massacre called the president “a symbol of renewed white identity.”\\nTrump, whose own previous responses to the movement have drawn scrutiny, expressed sympathy for the victims who died at “places of worship turned into scenes of evil killing.” But he declined to join expressions of mounting concern about white nationalism, saying “I don’t, really” when asked whether he thought it was a rising threat around the world.\\n“I think it’s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems, I guess,” Trump said. “If you look at what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that’s the case. I don’t know enough about it yet. But it’s certainly a terrible thing.”\\nTrump was asked about white nationalism and the shooting deaths of 49 people at mosques in Christchurch after he formally vetoed Congress’ resolution to block his declaration of a national emergency at the Mexico border. His veto, aimed at freeing money to build more miles of a border wall against illegal immigration, is expected to survive any congressional effort to overturn it.\\nQuestioned about the accused gunman’s reference to him, Trump professed ignorance.\\n“I didn’t see it. I didn’t see it,” he said. “But I think it’s a horrible event … a horrible, disgraceful thing and a horrible act.”\\nThe man accused of the shootings, whose name was not immediately released, left behind a lengthy document that outlined his motivations. He proudly stated that he was a 28-year-old Australian white nationalist who hates immigrants and was set off by attacks in Europe that were perpetrated by Muslims. In a single reference, he mentioned the U.S. president.\\n“Were/are you a supporter of Donald Trump?” was one of the questions he posed to himself. His answer: “As a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose? Sure. As a policy maker and leader? Dear god no.”\\nThe White House immediately denounced the connection. But the mention from the suspect, who embraced Nazi imagery and voiced support for fascism, nonetheless cast an uncomfortable light on the way that the president has been embraced by some on the far right.\\nTrump, who as a candidate proposed a ban on all Muslims entering the United States, has drawn criticism as being slow to condemn white supremacy and related violence. After a 2017 clash between white nationalists and anti-racist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one demonstrator dead, Trump said there were “very fine people on both sides” of the confrontation. He also did not immediately reject the support of David Duke, a former KKK Grand Wizard, during his presidential campaign.\\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., tied Trump’s inflammatory language to the violence half a world away.\\n“Words have consequences like saying we have an invasion on our border and talking about people as though they were different in some fatal way,” Blumenthal said on CNN. “I think that the public discourse from the president on down is a factor in some of these actions.”\\nFormer Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who declared his Democratic candidacy for president this week, said, “We must call out this hatred, this Islamophobia, this intolerance, and the violence that predictably follows from the rhetoric that we use.”\\nThe White House, in comments before those remarks, rejected any link to Trump.\\n“It’s outrageous to even make that connection between this deranged individual that committed this evil crime to the president who has repeatedly condemned bigotry, racism and made it very clear that this is a terrorist attack,” Mercedes Schlapp, the White House’s director of strategic communication, told reporters. “We are there to support and stand with the people of New Zealand.”\\nTrump himself telephoned New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, offering condolences, prayers and any help the U.S. might be able to provide. She told reporters she answered, “My message was: to offer sympathy and love to all Muslim communities.”\\nTrump’s hardline immigration rhetoric and calls to return America to its traditional past have been embraced by many on the conservative fringes, including some who troll online with racist imagery, as well as white supremacists who have looked to engage in violence.\\nIn Florida, Cesar Sayoc, who had decorated his van with Trump propaganda, was accused of mailing explosives last fall to Democratic Party officials and media members, many of whom had been criticized by the president. The president said Sayoc had been “insane” long before he became a Trump fan.\\nLast month, a former Coast Guard official was accused of stockpiling weapons in a plot to kill media members and liberal politicians as part of a plan to transform the U.S. into a white ethno-state. It took more than a week for Trump to respond to the plot, which he deemed “a shame.”\\nMany experts who track violent extremists have identified white nationalism as a growing threat in the U.S. and abroad. In January, for example, the New York-based Anti-Defamation League said that domestic extremists killed at least 50 people in the U.S. in 2018, up from 37 in 2017, and said, “White supremacists were responsible for the great majority of the killings, which is typically the case.”\\nSome critics have accused U.S. authorities of not dedicating adequate resources to stem a threat of domestic terrorism. However, The Washington Post reported last week that internal FBI data showed more domestic terror suspects were arrested last year than those allegedly inspired by international terror groups.\\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin and Michael Kunzelman in Washington and Alexandra Jaffe in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, contributed reporting.\\n \\n       President Trump’s lawyers have argued that the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution gives him immunity from facing a civil lawsuit filed in state court.Photo: Olivier Douliery/Bloomberg News    By Sara Randazzo    March 14, 2019 3:59 pm ET     16 Responses    President Trump must face a defamation lawsuit brought by a former reality-show contestant, a New York appellate court ruled Thursday, striking down his argument that a sitting president should be shielded from such claims.

I just saw a picture of you,” Trump says in a phone call. \\n \\n \\n “Oh, you’re giving me kind honors. I look like s**t,” Barrett responds in a video posted by his sister. Then, Trump calls him “a champ” and asks him: “You’re fighting it right?”\\n \\n \\n “That’s what the Irish do, right?” Barrett answers, to which Trump states: “Yeah that’s what the Irish do, you better believe it” before inviting him to a rally.\\n \\n \\n \\n Barrett recently left the hospital and is staying at her sister’s house as he receives palliative care. \\n \\n \\n “He said to me how cool would it be to visit DC and the President be there in the lawn waving,” Hoskie told CNN. “I just wanted to make that happen. i wanted him to have a moment to say, ‘Wow that just happened.” \\n \\n \\n So Hoskie started to secretly pull some strings to surprise her brother. \\n \\n \\n On her city’s blog, West Haven-The Way It Is, Hoskie asked people to email the White House and send a request to the President asking him to contact her brother. “From there, more people caught wind and everyone just pitched in to make it happen,” Hoskie said. “Hundreds of people emailed the White House.”\\n \\n \\n Lynne Patton, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development regional chief, contacted Barrett on Instagram after reading about his wish on a New Haven Register story, according to CNN affiliate WFSB. \\n \\n \\n Patton, who is from New Haven, then called Barrett on Monday night.\\n \\n \\n “I call her back and she’s like, ‘I’ve got somebody who wants to talk to you on the other line, do you mind’,” Barrett told WFSB. \\n \\n \\n It was the President’s son Eric. \\n \\n \\n “He sits there and he says, ‘You know I’ve talked to my sister and brother about you, Don, Ivanka, all of them, we’re hoping and praying for you, just keep fighting, don’t ever give up’.”\\n \\n \\n The President called the family the next day.\\n \\n \\n Barrett said of the gesture: “It would be a big deal, especially knowing he doesn’t do a lot of this stuff anymore. He’s got a lot of stuff on his schedule,” Barrett said.\\n \\n \\n Hoskie says the initiative went beyond the usual partisan political divisions. \\n \\n \\n “I contacted Mike Last, DTC chairman of my town, to help me have a few Republicans visit him. My Mayor Nancy Rossi helped get the word out and Republicans reached out for us.\\n \\n \\n “People in West Haven will do what they can for a Westie,” Hoskie said. \\n \\n \\n In the call, Trump also tells Barrett he will get a personal note from him delivered by Patton on Saturday and Barrett will be “sitting front, row center” at one of his rallies.\\n \\n \\n “You’re my kind of man, Jay. I’m very proud of you,” Trump said. “I’ll talk to you again, Jay, OK? You keep that fight going.

As Trump was under fire for his comments, Zervos came forward to accuse him of kissing her twice in 2007 and attacking her in a hotel room. “I never met her at a hotel,” responded Trump, who would also counter allegations from his accusers as “100 percent fabricated and made-up charges, pushed strongly by the media and the Clinton campaign.”\\nZervos alleged in her lawsuit that she was branded a liar.\\nThat led to Trump arguing that the U.S. Constitution didn’t allow this case to proceed right away thanks to the Supremacy Clause, which Trump’s attorney, Marc Kasowitz, posited meant “that state governments, including their courts, refrain from interfering in the operations of the federal government.”\\n“No one is above the law,” ruled New York state judge Jennifer Schecter a year ago in a decision that allowed the suit to continue.\\nOn Thursday, the First Appellate Division in New York affirmed that holding.\\nAppellate judge Dianne Renwick writes that the Supremacy Clause applies to federal laws, not federal officers.\\n“Defendant’s reading of the Supremacy Clause — that it bars a state court from exercising jurisdiction over him because he is the ‘ultimate repository of the Executive Branch’s powers and is required by the Constitution to be always in function’ — finds no support in the constitutional text or case law,” states the opinion. “Defendant’s interpretation conflicts with the fundamental principle that the United States has a ‘government of laws and not of men.\\'”\\nThe opinion (read in full here)\\xa0also addresses\\xa0Clinton v. Jones, a 1997 U.S. Supreme Court opinion, which determined that presidents aren’t immune from civil actions in federal court.\\n“Congress has not passed any law immunizing the President from state court damages lawsuits since Clinton v Jones was decided,” writes Renwick. “Therefore, because Clinton v Jones held that a federal court has jurisdiction over the kind of claim plaintiff now asserts and because there is no federal law limiting a state court from entertaining similar claims, it follows that state courts have concurrent jurisdiction with federal courts over actions against the President based on his purely unofficial acts.”\\nLater, Renwick shrugs off Trump’s concern that because the state court has the power to hold him in contempt should he not obey court orders that would constitute an impermissible exercise of authority over him. The judge says it’s merely a “hypothetical concern” and that the issue is not what’s presently before the appeals court.\\nTrump also attempted to defeat the lawsuit by invoking California’s anti-SLAPP statute and arguing that Zervos had no likelihood of prevailing in a defamation claim over statements he characterizes as opinion or hyperbole.\\n“The use of the term ‘liar’ could be perceived in some cases as no more than rhetorical hyperbole that is a nonactionable personal opinion,” acknowledges the appellate judge before rejecting the argument. Trump, she continues, “used the term [liar] in connection with his specific denial of factual allegations against him, which was necessarily a statement by him of his knowledge of the purported facts.”\\nNevertheless, it’s the Supremacy Clause discussion that is the big ticket here, as no appellate court had previously determined whether the president of the United States must face state suits while in office. And given that Trump is facing other actions as well as the potential for criminal indictments in New York, the determination that he can’t use his federal office to shield himself is undeniably consequential.\\nIn a dissent,\\xa0New York appellate judge Angela Mazzarelli comes to an alternative conclusion about the Supremacy Clause. She writes, “[S]ubjecting the President to a state trial court’s jurisdiction imposes upon him a degree of control by the State of New York that interferes with his ability to carry out his constitutional duty of executing the laws of the United States.”\\nTrump may continue to appeal the outcome up the New York Court of Appeals, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and, ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court. However, because the trial proceedings have not been paused during the pendency of the appeal, he’ll likely have to give a deposition in the coming months as both sides pursue the truth of what happened a decade ago through discovery.\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tTHR Newsletters\\n\\t\\n\\tSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\\n\\t\\n\\t \\n\\tSubscribe\\t\\n\\tSign Up\\n\\t\\n\\t \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t  President Trump issued the first veto of his presidency, striking down a resolution that would have terminated his national emergency declaration diverting funding to build the wall. The Senate voted Thursday by a margin of 59 to 41 to block Trump’s declaration that an emergency on the border with Mexico requires the construction of a wall, a project for which Congress has not appropriated money. A dozen Republicans defected and joined every Democrat in voting yes. The House previously passed the resolution last month, 245 (including 13 Republicans) to 182. Unless more Republicans defect from the president’s position, neither margin would be sufficient to override a veto. “Today I am vetoing this resolution,” said Trump. “Congress has the freedom to pass this resolution and I have the duty to veto it and I’m very proud to veto it.” Trump’s reelection campaign began fundraising off the veto early Friday afternoon, sending out an email asking supporters to donate to an “Official Wall Defense Fund.” Homeland Defense Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Attorney General William Barr and Vice President Mike Pence were among those who praised Trump’s veto during the Oval Office ceremony.       President Trump endorsing border security, March 15, 2019. (Photo: Evan Vucci/AP)   Shortly after the veto was official, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the vote to potentially override the veto would occur on March 26, saying \"House Republicans will have to choose between their partisan hypocrisy and their sacred oath to support and defend the Constitution.\" Trump had sought to frame the issue as voting for him or for “Nancy Pelosi, Crime and the Open Border Democrats.” The dozen senators who went against the White House were Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Rob Portman of Ohio, Marco Rubio of Florida, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Mitt Romney and Mike Lee, both of Utah. Lee proposed a version of the resolution that would have restricted future emergency declarations while grandfathering in Trump\\'s, but he couldn’t reach a compromise agreement with the White House, and the plan fizzled. “We tried to cut a deal,” Lee said. “The president didn’t appear interested.” The wall was a signature campaign issue for Trump, but he was never able to deliver on his promise to make Mexico pay for it, and the issue languished during his first two years in office. The emergency declaration came after Trump failed to win an appropriation for a border wall in a continuing resolution to fund the government last fall. The resulting deadlock shut the government for five weeks, during which time workers were furloughed or forced to work without pay. In declaring an emergency on Feb. 15, Trump cited drug smuggling across the border from Mexico (misleading), the drop in crime in El Paso, Texas, after a partial border barricade was built there (not true) and reports of women kidnapped, bound with tape and trafficked into the United States across unguarded sections of the border (no evidence exists of this). Hours later, he flew to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for a weekend of golf. _____  Read more from Yahoo News:     Women divided by race over key issues, but with areas of overlap     Some women are happy to let the march pass them by     Maverick Republican William Weld looks to run against Trump\\'s \\'malignant narcissism\\'     The Army\\'s killer drones: How a secretive special ops unit decimated ISIS     The Soviets wanted to infiltrate the Reagan camp.

As multiple investigations continue to swirl, Trump has taken comfort in the fact that current Justice Department policy says \"a president cannot be indicted while in office,\" people close to Trump tell The New York Times . In fact, the promise of using the presidency as a legal shield is reportedly one of the reasons Trump wants to stay in the White House. On Tuesday, the Times published copies of six checks Trump paid to his former lawyer Michael Cohen. They\\'re among 11 checks Cohen received to cover \"hush payments to prevent alleged sexual misconduct from being exposed before the 2016 presidential election,\" the Times says. Cohen provided two of those checks to Congress last week, and pleaded guilty last year to financial crimes relating to those payments. Cohen implicated Trump in his campaign finance crimes last year, and these check copies only add to the \"quality of the evidence\" against Cohen and Trump, former White House counsel Robert Bauer tells the Times. This \"now leaves little doubt that [Trump] faces criminal prosecution after he leaves office,\" says Bauer, who served under former President Barack Obama.

Trump laments that his opponents are treating him unfairly, praises the toughness and strength of his supporters — a category that combines the police, military, and Bikers for Trump, which he apparently views as a Brownshirt-like militia — and a prediction that his supporters will at some point end their restraint.\\n He does it again in a new interview with Breitbart:\\n  I actually think that the people on the right are tougher, but they don’t play it tougher. Okay? I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump – I have the tough people, but they don’t play it tough — until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad. \\n Early warnings that Trump could undermine the Constitution have not been borne out, which has produced a certain complacency about the issue. It is true that Trump is only an aspirational authoritarian, and to date has failed to bring his most illiberal dreams to life. He has used the government to punish independent media, prevailing upon the Post Office to raise rates on Amazon in retaliation for Jeff Bezos’s ownership of the Washington Post, and repeatedly told his staff to order the Justice Department to block a merger in order to punish CNN. So far, this has had little effect.\\n On the other hand, if Trump wins a second term — a prospect that, under current economic conditions, is close to a toss-up — his presidency will only be a quarter of the way through. Already his authoritarian rhetoric is so thoroughly normalized that it hardly even registers as news any more. Anybody whose political efforts involve helping Trump gain more power, rather than opposing that project, is playing Russian roulette with the Constitution.\\n Republicans have had some success in restraining Trump’s abuses — in large part by slow-walking his most blatantly illegal or authoritarian orders. But the GOP’s willingness to defy Trump has also eroded steadily over his presidency. Congress’s failure to block Trump’s use of emergency powers to build the border wall that Congress has declined to fund is an important marker in that deterioration.\\n Republicans used to define more modest exertions of executive power by President Obama as dangerous Caesarism. Republicans turned Obama’s rather casual vow to use his “pen and phone” to carry out executive authority into a Hitleresque claim of total power. Accordingly, when Trump claimed executive power to fund a project Congress refused to fund, at least some conservatives denounced his plans. North Carolina senator Thom Tillis wrote an op-ed calling for Congress to deny Trump’s authority.\\n “Conservatives rightfully cried foul when President Barack Obama used executive action to completely bypass Congress and unilaterally provide deferred action to undocumented adults who had knowingly violated the nation’s immigration laws. Some prominent Republicans went so far as to proclaim that Obama was acting more like an “emperor” or “king” than a president,” he wrote, “There is no intellectual honesty in now turning around and arguing that there’s an imaginary asterisk attached to executive overreach — that it’s acceptable for my party but not thy party.”\\n But then Trump started looking into supporting a primary challenger against Tillis. And lo and behold, Tillis abandoned the sacred principle. Republicans could have mustered a veto-proof majority to join with Democrats and block Trump, but failed. If Republicans are too frightened to defend what they themselves regard as a vital principle of the Constitution, what confidence should we have that they’ll stand in the way of Trump’s continued assaults on the Republic?\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Trump Threatens Violence If Democrats Don’t Support Him\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nWhen the news that Trump had his grades buried was revealed, many called foul, saying if they were as respectable as Trump claimed, he would have nothing to hide. However, new information coming to light suggests that Trump\\'s grades are nothing to look at, in the very literal sense, in that Trump\\'s grades were 0 across the board. Trump\\'s school, New York Military Academy, grades students on a decimal scale rather than a letter grade, and it is being reported that Trump failed every class without gaining a single point, and would in fact flaunt this fact to his fellow classmates and say that it didn\\'t matter, since his Father\\'s money would get him through school regardless, and would slack off in class when forced to attend. Classmates that have agreed to comment so long as they remain anonymous so they don\\'t have to deal with far right extremists, report that Trump was still regularly mocked about his failing grades and general stupidity, both to his face and behind his back. They said that Trump, with his thin skin and big ego, usually \"became a whining crybaby about it, saying we\\'d regret it and that his Father would make us pay, but given that he could never remember any of our names, we were never worried,\" one of the classmates commented.\\nAll of the classmates we were able to talk to also commented that they were surprised that Trump managed to go so long without landing in jail, attributing that to how corrupt the legal system currently is and how it treats rich people differently. They were so confident that Trump would end up in jail that they in fact made a pool on when he would be convicted, but reportedly since most of them though it would happen early, there are reportedly only 2 people left in the pool.\\nWe\\'ll let our readers know more about Trump\\'s failures as we learn more details.\\n\\n \\n\\tPresident Trump’s physician said Thursday the recent physical he underwent showed that he was “in very good health” — but also revealed that he had gained weight and was now considered obese under the government’s own guidelines.\\n“After taking into account all the laboratory results, examinations and specialist recommendations, it is my determination that the president remains in very good health overall,” wrote Dr. Sean Conley.\\nBut the stats he released show that Trump, who measured in at a height at 6-foot-3, had gained 4 pounds since his last results were released in July 2018, and now weighs in at 243 pounds.\\nThat gives him a Body Mass Index of 30.4, which according to the National Institute of Health’s BMI calculator makes him obese, but only by a couple pounds, as the threshold is a score of 30.\\nThe 72-year-old commander-in-chief’s blood pressure, heart, pulse and temperature all checked out normal.\\nThe only change in his medication was a higher dosage of the statin he had been taking to stave off heart disease.\\n\\t'"

       "'   During weeks of briefings and discussions over the escalating coronavirus, President Trump has repeatedly fixated on one thing above all: the numbers. He has aggressively quizzed aides about infection statistics — asking how many cases are in each state, and how the quantity compares with other countries. He has clung to the rosiest projections, repeating only the figures that support his belief that the coronavirus is not morphing into a global catastrophe. And he has intensely followed the plummeting stock market, which plunged more than 1,600 points Wednesday.  Trump’s obsession with numbers — both publicly and privately — has dominated and shaped the administration’s response to the coronavirus, as advisers and public health experts try to placate a leader who largely views the global pandemic through the political lens of how the statistics reflect on his presidency and hopes for reelection. This account is based on interviews with more than a dozen administration officials and other observers, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. He wants market numbers up, and he wants case numbers down. Trump is a man who has measured much of his life in numbers — first wealth, then crowd size and votes, and now unemployment and economic numbers — while saying relatively little about the human suffering caused by the coronavirus crisis. “The numbers from a week ago were great, from two days ago were great — but now we’re hitting a patch,” Trump said Wednesday during a meeting at the White House with Wall Street bankers. “And we’re going to have to do something with respect to … getting rid of this virus as quickly as possible and as safely as possible.” Asked Tuesday by reporters at the Capitol if he had been briefed that up to 100 million Americans could ultimately be exposed to the virus, Trump again returned to the numbers.    Six fact-checks of President Trump’s false claims during his 10-minute coronavirus address to the nation on March 11. (Video: The Washington Post)    “I’ve been briefed on every contingency you can possibly imagine, many contingencies,” the president said. “A lot of positive. Different numbers. All different numbers. Very large numbers. And some small numbers too, by the way.” Trump’s tendency to minimize the threat has stood in marked contrast to leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who during a Wednesday news conference in Berlin warned that the majority of her citizens could face infection. “When the virus is out there, the population has no immunity and no therapy exists, then 60 to 70 percent of the population will be infected,” Merkel said. Privately, administration officials are trying to get Trump more comfortable with the idea of an inevitable rise in the number of coronavirus cases — in part by explaining to him that a higher number of cases overall could potentially result in a lower mortality rate. Sharing the growing number of cases might also demonstrate that many of those who test positive are asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms, a senior administration official said. Trump is increasingly coming to accept that the number of individuals who have tested positive for the virus is going to rise, even though he’s not happy about it, the official added. Officials on the White House coronavirus task force have privately predicted to journalists that cases are going to increase exponentially in the coming days and weeks. The goal, they say, is to telegraph to the public what is almost certain to come so that it is not a shock, all without angering Trump or sounding alarmist. Surgeon General Jerome Adams offered an example of such messaging on Sunday, when he told CNN that the time for containment measures had passed. “Now, we’re shifting into a mitigation phase, which means we’re helping communities understand, you’re going to see more cases,” Adams said. “Unfortunately, you’re going to see more deaths, but that doesn’t mean that we should panic.” Nonetheless, many officials and experts have remained concerned that the administration is treating the virus more as a political communications problem than a public health one, and continuing to downplay the numbers. Some White House officials focused on public communications have tried to argue to outside experts that a portion of the cases across the country are from people who recently traveled to Europe — another epicenter of the outbreak — and less so from the spread between individuals in U.S. communities. One outside public health expert said he was skeptical of the administration spin but understood the goal was to sell the public on the idea that the virus numbers are not spreading as fast as some fear. Trump has also asked for data presentations comparing the new coronavirus with seasonal influenza, a White House official said, and has frequently expressed surprise on how deadly the flu can be. Touring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Friday, Trump said he “didn’t know people died from the flu,” which according to the agency has killed 12,000 to 61,000 people in the United States annually since 2010. In fact, Trump’s paternal grandfather died in the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. And on Monday, the president tweeted, “So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!” Trump’s suggestion that the coronavirus is less serious than the common flu is contradicted by the administration’s own top health experts. Testifying before Congress on Wednesday, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci described the virus as “10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu.” “This is a really serious problem that we have to take seriously,” Fauci said, deploying the sort of specific statistics Trump has generally eschewed. “People always say, well, the flu does this, the flu does that. The flu has a mortality of 0.1 percent. This has a mortality of 10 times that. That’s the reason I want to emphasize we have to stay ahead of this.” One senior administration official involved in the response said the obsession with numbers is selective. The president and some members of the task force, for instance, are eager to continually update and release statistics related to diagnostic tests because they will only increase and that reflects positively on the response. But there has been more hesitation to provide Trump with numbers related to the climbing number of cases because the president views those numbers as alarmist and damaging to the economy. “On diagnostic kits — those numbers only move up, but they move up for the right reasons,” the senior official said. “The case numbers move up, but that only serves to cause pandemonium.” The president also regularly receives data on a range of scenarios for how the virus could progress — and almost always seizes on the most optimistic numbers, seeming to ignore or tune out the higher numbers, officials said. “If one doesn’t want numbers because it makes someone look bad, that’s not a good use of the numbers,” said Jonathan Fielding, a professor of public health policy and management at University of California at Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health. “If numbers help better track a response, that’s certainly reasonable. But obviously concerns about numbers looking bad — concerns about that is not the use of metrics that helps a situation.”   During his Friday CDC visit, Trump’s focus on how the numbers would play for him emerged yet again when he said he would rather have passengers remain on the Grand Princess cruise ship — which was facing a coronavirus outbreak — than come ashore and add to the existing case count. “I like the numbers being where they are,” Trump said. “I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship.” Trump’s comments were so striking that on Monday, Democratic Massachusetts Sens. Edward J. Markey and Elizabeth Warren wrote to Vice President Pence asking, among other things, “Has the President instructed or implied to you or other Task Force members that your goal should be to misleadingly limit the reported number of cases in the United States by (1) refusing entry into the United States for infected citizens to reduce the number of reported cases or (2) any other means?” The president has also obsessed over the gyrating financial markets, which he and his team view as crucial to his 2020 reelection bid. At his private Mar-a-Lago Club this past weekend, Trump told donors that the Dow Jones industrial average — which plunged below 24,000 on Wednesday — would be at 30,000 if it weren’t for the coronavirus driving down the numbers, attendees present for his remarks said. Trump also decided Monday to appear at the regular coronavirus task force press briefing only after watching stock market numbers tumble all day, a senior administration official said. The original plan was for him not to speak, but he changed his mind after spending the day watching cable news coverage of the falling markets. “The number of covid-19 cases rising and the stock market dropping are what’s keeping Trump up at night,” said Dan Eberhart, a prominent Republican donor, referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus. “What should be keeping him up is the avalanche of bad economic data that will begin showing up in about a month.” Anne Gearan contributed to this report.   On 1 September 1991, a large private yacht cruised towards the Statue of Liberty. It was a clear, breezy evening, and from the upper deck of the Spirit of New York, a golden sunset could be seen glinting off the Manhattan skyline. Downstairs, a party was in flow. Scores of teenage girls in evening dresses and miniskirts, some as young as 14, danced under disco lights. It could have been a high school prom, were it not for the crowd of older men surrounding them. As the evening wore on, some of the men – many old enough to be the girls’ fathers, or even grandfathers – joined them on the dancefloor, pressing themselves against the girls. One balding man in a suit wrapped his arms around two young models, leering into a film camera that was documenting the evening: “Can you get some beautiful women around me, please?” The party aboard the Spirit of New York was one of several events that Donald Trump, then 45, attended with a group of 58 aspiring young models that September. They had travelled from around the world to compete in Elite’s Look of the Year competition, an annual event that had been running since 1983 and was already credited with launching the careers of Cindy Crawford, Helena Christensen and Stephanie Seymour. At stake was a life-changing prize: a $150,000 contract with the world’s then leading modelling agency, Elite Model Management, run by John Casablancas. Trump was closely involved in Casablancas’s competition. In 1991, he was a headline sponsor, throwing open the Plaza, his lavish, chateau-style hotel overlooking Central Park, transforming it into the main venue and accommodating the young models. He was also one of its 10 judges. In 1992, Trump hosted the competition again. On a similarly golden evening in early September that year, another group of contestants boarded the Spirit of New York, chartered for another Elite cruise. One of the girls on the boat was Shawna Lee, then a 14-year-old from a small town outside Toronto. She recalls how the contestants were encouraged to parade downstairs, one by one, and dance for Trump, Casablancas and others. Lee, an introverted teenager who loved to draw but hated school, was in New York for the first time. “A woman at the agency was pushing me,” she recalls. “I said to her, ‘I don’t see why me going down the stairs and dancing in front of those two has anything to do with me becoming a model. And she said, ‘No, you look great, take off your blazer and go and do it.’ So I walked down the stairs. I didn’t dance – I blew a kiss at them, spun around and walked away.”     \\n  Contestants wait to board the Spirit of New York yacht, September 1991. Photograph: Nina Berman/NOOR \\n   Another contestant, who was 15 at the time, also remembers being asked to walk for Trump, Casablancas and other men on the boat in September 1992. She says an organiser told her that if she refused, she would be excluded from the competition. “I knew in my gut it wasn’t right,” she recalls. “This wasn’t being judged or part of the competition – it was for their entertainment.” While Elite’s official brochure stated that contestants were aged between 14 and 24, all of those the Guardian has spoken to, competing in both years, were aged between 14 and 19. Some had come to New York with parents or chaperones in tow; others were alone. Many were away from their families for the first time. For them, the stakes were high, and the pressure to impress the judges great. As Casablancas had warned them at the outset of the competition, in a scene recorded by TV cameras: “You are going to be judged, constantly judged.” (In 1991 and 1992, the Elite contest was filmed for a 60-minute glossy television special, featuring interviews and behind-the-scenes footage, and later screened on Fox – an early foray into reality TV.) Casablancas was a powerful figure in the industry, and to many of the new crop of would-be supermodels, this seemed an opportunity too good to miss. Three decades on, a very different picture of the competition is beginning to emerge. Over the last six months, the Guardian has spoken to several dozen former Look of the Year contestants, as well as industry insiders, and obtained 12 hours of previously unseen, behind-the-scenes footage. The stories we have heard suggest that Casablancas, and some of the men in his orbit, used the contest to engage in sexual relationships with vulnerable young models. Some of these allegations amount to sexual harassment, abuse or exploitation of teenage girls; others are more accurately described as rape.             \\n  Top left: John Casablancas with Naomi Campbell, who co-presented the 1991 Look of the Year finale.

Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images \\n   No such allegations have been levelled against Trump, who at the time was dating Marla Maples, the woman who in 1993 became his second wife. But his close involvement in the contest raises questions for the president. Did he know that Casablancas and others were sleeping with contestants? Why would a man in his 40s, whose main business was real-estate development, want to host a beauty contest for teenage girls? Journalists have scoured almost every corner of the 45th president’s life, but his friendship with Casablancas, and his involvement in Look of the Year in 1991 and 1992, have been largely overlooked. Yet the competition is more than a footnote in the Donald Trump story. In time, it would prove to be the foundation of his pivot into reality TV. He even married a former Look of the Year contestant: the current first lady, Melania Trump, narrowly missed out on a trip to New York in 1992, after coming second in the Slovenian heat.  When John Casablancas arrived in New York in 1977, aged 35, he quickly caused a stir. Branded “the snatcher” for poaching models from rivals for his Elite Model Management agency, he gained a reputation as a ruthless operator. Handsome and charismatic, the son of a former Balenciaga model and a wealthy Spanish banker, he formed the agency that became Elite in Paris in his late 20s. Within years of setting up shop in New York, Casablancas was generating millions of dollars in revenue each year, and ushering in the era of the supermodel. Glamorous friends flocked to Elite parties in fashionable clubs like Studio 54. It’s not clear how Casablancas first met Trump but, according to several former models who encountered him during the 1980s, the businessman became a regular at his parties. With the opening of Trump Tower on New York’s Fifth Avenue in 1983, and the acquisition of the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in 1985, Trump had gained the reputation of a high-flying playboy in his own right. In 1987 he published The Art Of The Deal, and a flurry of publicity followed. “He sits atop a $3 billion empire,” proclaimed the Washington Post, “and seems to have a Midas touch.” It was perhaps unsurprising that Trump, a New York celebrity who liked to date beautiful women, should come to know the city’s best-known model agent. “Trump was good with PR and that was something John liked,” says Jeremie Roux, who now runs System, a modelling agency he cofounded with Casablancas in 2009. “Good or negative press was all good to Trump.” Patty Owen, an Elle and Cosmopolitan cover star, recalls seeing Trump at Elite parties as far back as 1982. “He would always be at the bar. That’s where he would stay and that’s where all the new models would hang out,” she says. “Whenever I saw him, I was always like: why does John have to invite him?” Barbara Pilling, also then an Elite model, told us Trump asked her out for dinner in the summer of 1989 at an industry soiree. She recalls Trump asking how old she was. “I said 17 and he said, ‘That’s just great – you’re not too old, not too young.’”         \\n  Top: Stacy Wilkes on the Spirit of New York in 1991, with that year’s winner, Ingrid Seynhaeve. Photograph: Nina Berman/NOOR \\n  Bottom: Shawna Lee (second from right) with other contestants at the 1992 Look of the Year competition \\n   Speaking to the Guardian, four former Elite models say that in the late 80s or early 90s, when they were teenagers, the agency required them to attend private dinners with Trump, Casablancas and sometimes other men. One was Shayna Love, an Australian model who was 16 when she came to New York for the first time in the summer of 1991. Recalling a dinner she attended, she says now: “It was presented as our duty as models at the agency. It wasn’t an invitation. It was like, you have to go and do this.” She says the dinner she attended, at which 10 or 15 models were present, was served at a long table in a private area of an upmarket restaurant. “I was at one end with John, and Trump was up the other end… surrounded by the other girls.” In the spring of 1991, Trump and Casablancas struck a business deal. Trump would sponsor Look of the Year’s final and host contestants at the Plaza, which would double as the headquarters. At the time, Trump faced significant financial pressures and was close to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but it didn’t seem to deter him. In the newly unearthed, behind-the-scenes footage of Look of the Year 1991, Trump makes a series of appearances alongside Casablancas, whom he describes as “my friend John”. At one point, Casablancas reveals how he and Trump struck their business partnership. “I had prepared for a long meeting with Donald Trump to explain to him why this was going to be a great success,” Casablancas tells the crowd. “In fact, I hadn’t finished my third sentence and he said: ‘I love the idea. Let’s do it.’” Trump now disputes being friends with Casablancas. The president’s representatives told the Guardian that he denies it “in the strongest possible terms”. Trump, they said, “hardly knew him, spent very little time with him, and knew very little about him”.  Stacy Wilkes had never been anywhere like the New York Plaza when she arrived at Trump’s hotel with another contestant in September 1991. Then 16, she was living in Louisville, Kentucky, with her mother, who was struggling to make ends meet. The teenager would hold yard sales and mow lawns to make extra cash. “I was just so excited to be in a hotel,” she says. “To go from a poor part of Kentucky to a place like this – I felt like the little kid in Home Alone.” She recalls feeling out of place in a hotel where “everything was gold”. The teenager had been selected as part of a sprawling international search, overseen by Casablancas, for “new faces”. Many contestants had come through feeder competitions after winning regional heats, or being spotted in malls and hotel lobbies or, in one case, on the beach. Casablancas had visited Wilkes’ local mall to host an Elite scouting event a year earlier, when she was 15. Her local agent had sent her to meet him, telling her what to wear and how to act. She says: “I was told to put my hair down in front of my face and then, like, whoop it around and look up at him.”  Did you attend Elite\\'s Look of the Year in the 1990s?

One year later, Wilkes was among those met at the airport by a scrum of photographers, and whisked into limousines – a supermodel welcome. “That was kind of neat,” she recalls. The contestants assembled beneath crystal chandeliers at the Plaza to meet Casablancas. He told them they would be judged over several days ahead of a gala evening, when the winner would be crowned. The girls would undergo makeovers and attend photocalls, donning spandex for an exercise routine in front of the Plaza. The behind-the-scenes footage shows Casablancas informing the would-be models that attention would be paid not just to appearance, but to “the way you are, your attitude, your personality, your sense of cooperation”.         \\n  Top, from left: John Casablancas, photographer Patrick Demarchelier and Gérald Marie, head of Elite’s Paris office and a 1991 Look of the Year judge. Photograph: FameFlynet.uk.com \\n  Bottom: Donald Trump with contestants in the 1991 Look of the Year competition, the year he was a judge \\n   At 16, Wilkes was one of the older contestants in Look of the Year. The 1992 Fox documentary reported that the average age was 15, and the film’s interviews make the youth of many contestants plain. Standing before the judges for the key swimwear round, the aspiring models are asked to tell the panel about themselves. “I sing and love animals,” says one girl, nervously. Another tells the judges: “I like big dogs and chocolate.” Later, during a photoshoot, a photographer instructs a 15-year-old to show more of her cleavage by pulling her bra lower. “More,” he tells her. “More. More.” In 1991, there were 10 judges in total, eight of them men, including Trump, Casablancas, the celebrity magician David Copperfield, and the president of Elite’s European division, Gérald Marie. For the swimwear round, judges including Trump and Casablancas sat at a table in one of the Plaza’s palatial rooms, rating the teenage models. “I felt so uncomfortable, standing there in my bathing suit,” recalls Wilkes. She says that at one stage of the contest the judges said she should lose weight: “It felt like they were ganging up on me.” The contestant who came third in 1991 was Kate Dillon, then 17. Dillon, who went on to become a successful plus-sized model, says that many of her fellow competitors were “from places that were very poor. I came from a family that had means, so it was something fun to do for a week to get out of school – but a lot of these girls were desperate.” She recalls various “after-hours” events over the course of the five-day competition. “It was very clear that there were opportunities to go out and party with Donald,” she says. The contestants were led to believe “that if you were nice to certain people, good things will happen to you, and I think that’s why girls were going out”. The behind-the-scenes footage seen by the Guardian shows brief snippets of the future president mingling with the Look of the Year models. At an evening reception, he seems to play the role of host, moving regally around the Plaza’s ornate rooms in a suit and tie, talking to VIP guests and contestants. “How’s the Canadian contestants?” he asks, before moving over to a handful of Canadian would-be models and introducing himself. At another point, he circulates on the top deck of the Spirit of New York as the boat prepares to depart. Wearing a billowing cream blazer, pink open-neck shirt and oversized baseball cap, Trump grins while posing for photographs and chatting to several girls. One tells him she is just finishing school. Some former contestants recall him being there as they got dressed for events. “Every time we changed, it was like Trump would find a reason to come backstage,” Wilkes says. A Canadian contestant from 1992 recalls similar incidents. “He’d come by and say, ‘Hey girls, are we ready?’” she says. “I remember thinking, what have I got myself into?” Trump denies, “in the strongest possible terms”, behaving inappropriately with any Look of the Year contestants. His representatives say he was not aware of any predatory environment at the time. Others, however, observed a disturbing side to the contest. Ohad Oman, a young reporter for a magazine in Tel Aviv, was sent to cover it in 1991 and 1992. He attended a number of the after-parties, and remembers seeing girls drinking alcohol. He recalls one particularly debauched party, telling the Guardian: “I saw girls sitting on guys’ laps, and I remember one guy putting his hand down a girl’s top. I remember thinking they were younger than me, and I was 17 going on 18.” (The legal drinking age is 21 in the US.) Others who were present recall underage models being served alcohol at the contest. Trump’s representatives say he did not provide alcohol to contestants, or encourage any models, whether below the drinking age or not, to drink alcohol, stressing he “does not drink alcohol and does not encourage others to do so”.     \\n  A still from previously unseen footage of the 1991 Look of the Year finale \\n   The finale of the 1991 competition was a glittering black-tie gala in the Plaza’s ballroom. Casablancas and supermodel Naomi Campbell presented, as 10 finalists went through a series of costume changes, walking across a stage decorated with columns of sunflowers. Trump sat on the front row alongside a roster of celebrities, his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka perched on his knee. Ingrid Seynhaeve, an 18-year-old from Belgium, was crowned the winner. As the evening drew to a close, Seynhaeve was surrounded by photographers. Guests filtered out of the ballroom as a party got going in another of the Plaza’s grand rooms. In the newly uncovered footage, a man can be heard off-camera, saying: “Come on, babes. Let’s get some liquor in you.”  In the months before and after the contests, Elite sent several of its teenage models to Milan, New York or Paris on assignments, usually by themselves. Shawna Lee, the 14-year-old from Canada who felt pressured to perform on the Spirit of New York in 1992, had spent the previous summer in Paris, working for Elite. She recalls days at castings, and nights out partying, including at the legendary Les Bains Douches nightclub. After one drunken night at the club, one of the first times she had drunk alcohol, she says a senior executive at Elite offered her a ride home on his motorbike. Gérald Marie, then in his early 40s, was head of Elite’s Paris office, a powerful figure in the fashion industry and a 1991 Look of the Year judge. Lee accepted the offer. “I was like, OK, sure, because I was always relying on whoever to get me home,” she says. But she alleges that, rather than taking her home, Marie brought her to his apartment and told her to come to his bedroom. Lee says she initially refused, asking about his wife. She says Marie responded: “Oh no, just come and sleep in the bed with me, don’t worry,” and she relented. “So I don’t know, I just went.” Lee says the #MeToo movement has emboldened her to talk about what happened next. It was her first sexual experience. “I just froze,” she says. “I really didn’t know what to do.” Looking back 30 years later, she feels she was taken advantage of. “I just felt really pressured,” she says. “I was really young and I was manipulated.” She told a friend what had happened, and this soon got back to Elite’s agents. “They all knew something went down, but they downplayed it,” says Lee, who is now 42 and works as a makeup artist in Toronto. “It was just understood that it was in my best interest to walk away from it and brush it under the rug.” Questions about Marie’s alleged mistreatment of teenage models are not new. In 2000, New York magazine reported that two of Elite’s senior women executives had pleaded with both Casablancas and Marie to stop sleeping with underage models, but had been ignored. (“We are men,” Marie reportedly said. “We have our needs.”) In 2011, the Elite supermodel and actor Carré Otis alleged that Marie had repeatedly raped her when she was a 17-year-old model in Paris in the 1980s. Two years ago, another Elite model, Ebba Karlsson, accused Marie of raping her when she was 21. Marie did not respond to a formal letter from the Guardian, but in a brief phone call insisted he had never sexually assaulted any models, and denied the specific allegations levelled against him by Lee. “It’s absurd, I don’t know this person,” he said. “Allegations like this are becoming too easy to make. Frankly, it hurts.”     \\n  Trump with his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka at the 1991 Look of the Year final. Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images \\n   Other men closely involved in Look of the Year during this period have been accused of sexual misconduct by former contestants. Some allegations are contained in legal proceedings filed decades ago; others have been shared for the first time with the Guardian. The newspaper has decided not to publish some of these allegations, at the request of the women involved. One allegation already made public concerns David Copperfield, an associate of both Casablancas and Trump, who judged Look of the Year in 1988 and 1991, and once dated another Elite supermodel, Claudia Schiffer. Two years ago, as the #MeToo movement reverberated through the entertainment industry, he was the subject of allegations by Brittney Lewis, a 17-year-old contestant in the 1988 Look of the Year, held in Japan. According to her account, published on the entertainment news website The Wrap, Copperfield invited her to a show in California after she had returned home to Utah. Lewis alleged that she saw Copperfield pour something into her glass and then blanked out, but says she retained hazy recollections of him sexually assaulting her in his hotel room. Copperfield stated on Twitter at the time that he had been “falsely accused” in the past, and was now having to “weather another storm”. He added: “Please for everyone’s sake, don’t rush to judgment.” In response to the Guardian’s questions about the alleged assault, his representatives said that the claims were false and seriously defamatory. Several of the 1991 contestants recall Copperfield behaving in a way that now strikes them as inappropriate. Stacy Wilkes says Copperfield called the hotel room she was sharing with another 15-year-old contestant, inviting the other girl to his room. Another remembers translating a phone call from Copperfield into Spanish so he could invite a teenage contestant to his hotel room. Aimee Bendio, who was a 14-year-old Look of the Year contestant in 1991, says Copperfield and his assistant contacted her at her family home several times after she took part in the contest, “checking in to see how my career was going”. She says the magician invited her to his shows, offering to send a limousine, but she declined.         \\n  Top: magician David Copperfield on the Spirit of New York in 1991, the year he was a judge \\n  Bottom: Copperfield with former girlfriend Claudia Schiffer. Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images \\n   Maya Rubin, a 16-year-old contestant in 1991, says Copperfield approached her on the Spirit of New York. “I told him I’m from Israel,” she recalls. “He said to me that his mum always wanted him to marry a Jewish girl.” Months later, she says, the magician sent her a Christmas card. Copperfield categorically denies behaving inappropriately with any contestants at any time. In the early 90s, Look of the Year contestants who secured modelling contracts with Elite were introduced to a fledgling financial advisory firm, Star Capital Management. It was run by an associate of Casablancas, David Weil. Housed at Elite’s Manhattan offices, and an official sponsor of Look of the Year, Weil’s company advertised its services in the 1991 competition programme with a photograph of a small girl dressed in adult clothing and jewellery, alongside the marketing line: “Just like you, we’re not just another pretty face.” By the following year, Star Capital Management was handling millions of dollars earned by Elite’s models. The business soon caught the attention of federal authorities, who later accused Weil and his business partner of stealing at least $1.2m from their clients. In 1998, Weil pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges. He also pleaded guilty to the statutory rape of a 15-year-old model he had met at Look of the Year in 1992. Weil was sentenced to serve weekends in prison for three months, and required to register as a sex offender for 10 years. Mark Lawless, a New York lawyer who brought a civil fraud case against Star Capital Management on behalf of the 1991 Look of the Year winner Ingrid Seynhaeve and others, says that when he inspected its office, he found an adjoining bedroom. One of the desk’s drawers, he recalls, contained “bullets and condoms”. Weil declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian. Four years after Weil’s conviction, in 2002, Casablancas faced his own set of accusations in the civil courts. A former Look of the Year contestant, known only as Jane Doe 44, filed a lawsuit accusing him of repeatedly sexually abusing her, beginning when she was 15. The abuse began, according to the lawsuit, at Look of the Year 1988 in Japan, where Casablancas told Doe he was “falling in love” with her. At the end of the competition, the lawsuit states, “contestants drank and partied late into the evening” and Casablancas told the teenager to come to his hotel room. There, Casablancas sexually abused the girl “several times over the evening”. The abuse allegedly continued the following year; when the girl became pregnant, Casablancas told her “she would be having an abortion”. The abortion was allegedly “arranged and paid for” by Elite. Casablancas was 46 at the time.     \\n  John Casablancas with his third wife, Aline Wermelinger, in 1995; they met when she was a 1992 Look of the Year contestant. Photograph: The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images \\n   The lawsuit also alleged that Casablancas “engaged in a pattern of seducing, sexually exploiting and/or abusing minor girls, including girls as young as 14 or 15 years old”. But in 2003, the Los Angeles superior court dismissed the claims against him because he did not live in California, where it had been filed. At the time, a lawyer for Casablancas said the allegations were without merit. Trump’s representatives have told the Guardian he denies in the strongest possible terms having any knowledge at the time that Casablancas allegedly engaged in sexual relationships with Look of the Year contestants, including those who were under the age of consent, or that Casablancas allegedly enabled others to exploit or abuse teenage models. But Casablancas’ sexual interest in teenage girls predated this period. His marriage to his second wife, Danish model Jeanette Christiansen, ended in 1983 when it emerged that he was having an affair with a 15-year-old model, Stephanie Seymour. Casablancas, who was in his early 40s at the time, later described Seymour as a “woman-child”. He met his third wife, Brazilian model Aline Wermelinger, in 1992, when she was a Look of the Year contestant staying at Trump’s Plaza. They married the following year; Casablancas was 51 and she was 17.  By his own account, Donald Trump got to know financier Jeffrey Epstein in the late 1980s. “He’s a lot of fun to be with,” Trump famously told New York magazine in 2002. “It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.” After Epstein was charged with the sex trafficking of underage girls last year, the president distanced himself, telling reporters he knew the financier “like everybody in Palm Beach knew him”, but hadn’t spoken to him in 15 years. “I was not a fan of his, that I can tell you,” he said. Trump’s representatives told the Guardian that he had “kicked Mr Epstein out” of Mar-a-Lago for acting inappropriately towards staff. Photographs of Trump with Epstein, who owned a house near Mar-a-Lago, were widely circulated in the wake of the financier’s arrest last year. Renewed attention was also given to a deposition by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who said she was first approached by Epstein’s friend, the British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, while working as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago in 1999. It also appears that Epstein had a Casablancas connection during the 1990s. According to a lawsuit filed in the US three months ago, in 1990 Casablancas sent a teenage model for her first “casting call” at a residential address on New York’s Upper East Side, to meet a “photographer” who, it turned out, was Epstein. The lawsuit states that Epstein ordered the 15-year-old girl to undress before taking photographs of her, pushing her against a wall and sexually assaulting her.

George Houraney, a businessman whose American Dream Calendar Girls beauty contest had been running in Las Vegas casinos since 1978, recalls encountering Epstein at Mar-a-Lago in January 1993. Houraney says that Trump asked him to organise a party that month with some of his pageant’s finalists, promising to invite heads of modelling agencies and prospective sponsors for his competition. “He had me fly in all these girls, and gave me a $30,000 budget for airfares and limos to pick them up at the airport,” he says. “The girls were all decked out, expecting to meet all these VIPs.” But after an hour at the party, Houraney says, there seemed to be only one other guest: Epstein. “I was like, ‘Donald, where are the guys? What’s going on here?’ And he said, ‘Well, this is it.’” Houraney says he realised “this is a Jeff Epstein party, basically”. While suspicious of Epstein, Houraney was keen to have Trump as a business partner. A month earlier, in December 1992, Trump had met with Houraney and Jill Harth, who ran the pageant together. They were looking for a new sponsor for their contest, which each year saw models aged 16 to 22 compete to appear in wall calendars wearing bikinis and swimsuits while posing with classic cars. At dinner in the Plaza’s Oak Room, Harth, Houraney and Trump discussed moving the American Dream competition from Las Vegas to one of Trump’s casinos. “He wanted to build this into the biggest, the best thing that he could do. He was talking about television and pulling out all the contacts,” Harth later said. Eventually, the pageant was held at Trump Castle in Atlantic City in November 1993, but for one year only. The partnership soured and ended in two lawsuits, but for Trump it was a prelude to a series of more lucrative ventures in the beauty business. In 1996, he secured what the New York Daily News described as “his most beautiful deal yet”. After months of negotiations, Trump acquired the Miss Universe Organization in a reported $10m deal that handed him control of three large, well-established pageants: Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA. Three years later, he founded Trump Model Management, poaching many staff from Elite. For Wolfgang Schwarz, a veteran model agent in Austria who worked closely with Casablancas, and met Trump at the Plaza in the early 90s, Trump’s decision to establish his own agency was about him wanting his own private source for models. “If you have your own agency and you’re the owner, you can tell your bookers to make a party,” Schwarz says. “It’s easier than calling 15 agencies in New York.” Trump’s representatives say he entered the modelling industry because it was a “very profitable” business opportunity.         \\n  Top: Kate Dillon, in behind-the-scenes footage from the 1991 contest \\n  Bottom: Casablancas with 1992 Look of the Year winner Mariann Molski, then 14. Photograph: Everett Collection/Alamy \\n   The Miss Universe deal allowed Trump to realise his ambition of turning a pageant into an international televised event. In 1997, he sold a 50% stake in the business to CBS. Five years later, amid a slump in the Miss Universe ratings, Trump brokered a deal with NBC that led to the launch of The Apprentice in 2004. The move into reality TV positioned Trump as a heavyweight tycoon with a significant media profile. In many ways, it was a natural progression from his involvement in beauty contests and pageants. Where once he had judged young models, whose hopes, rivalries and insecurities became TV storylines in Fox’s Look of the Year documentary, now he was ruthlessly separating aspiring business people into winners and losers.  Three decades on from the contests at Trump’s Plaza, it is striking to reflect on the diverging fortunes of those who attended. Many of the powerful men Casablancas brought on board to help judge the girls thrived in the years that followed. Gérald Marie is now the chairman of a prestigious model agency in Paris, Oui Management. Although Marie told the Guardian he had retired, his LinkedIn page lists his responsibilities at the “thriving newcomer” agency as scouting for and managing talent. Oui Management did not respond to our request for comment. David Copperfield remains a prominent entertainer, with a current residency at the MGM Grand resort in Las Vegas. The fortunes of the teenagers who took part have been mixed. Some became successful models, Hollywood actors and TV hosts, while many more lived quieter lives. Ingrid Seynhaeve, the 1991 winner, became a face of Ralph Lauren and Dior, hosted Belgium’s Topmodel TV show, and continues to front high-profile campaigns. Other contestants we spoke to include a beautician, a stay–at–home mother, a makeup artist, a yoga teacher and a bus driver. In 1992, the crown went to one of Look of the Year’s youngest contenders: 14-year-old Mariann Molski. Months after her victory, a profile in the Chicago Tribune reported that the sporty high school student was “on the brink of a career of a kind that most young women only dream about”. While she had some success as a model, it is not clear what happened to her in the years that followed; US public records indicate multiple arrests for probation violations, alcohol offences and prostitution, though there is nothing to say she was ever charged. Molski’s current whereabouts are unknown, but she is believed to have been homeless in Arizona. After years of financial mismanagement, Elite was forced into bankruptcy in 2004. The Elite brand continues to be used by two separate agencies, owned by different corporate entities. One is Creative World Management, which bought the New York division in 2004. It strongly distances itself from the Casablancas-owned firm and era, saying it “utterly” condemns the kinds of “deplorable behaviour” alleged to have taken place in the past. The other inheritor of the brand is Elite World Group, which operates the successor to Look of the Year, a similar global contest for the next top young model, called Elite Model Look. It, too, distances itself from the Casablancas era. “We would have no tolerance for the conduct you’ve described,” the company told the Guardian. “Empowering our models and protecting their safety is our foremost priority.”         \\n  Donald Trump with contestants in 1991’s Elite Look of the Year \\n   John Casablancas retired in Brazil in the early 2000s. He died in Rio de Janeiro in 2013, aged 70, long before the #MeToo movement heralded a new standard of accountability for powerful men accused of exploiting women and girls. He never got to see his old associate Donald Trump ascend to the White House, despite a cascade of allegations about Trump’s own treatment of women. There are now at least 25 sexual misconduct allegations against the president, ranging from unwanted advances and harassment to serious sexual assaults. More than half relate to models or pageant contestants. Trump denies that he has ever behaved in a predatory or inappropriate fashion with any women or girls. Speaking to the Guardian 30 years on, several former Look of the Year contestants feel that a #MeToo moment for the modelling world is long overdue. “The girls are young and they look at these agents like parental figures, and they’re not,” says Shawna Lee. “Anything they say goes, whether it’s ‘Go cut your hair’, ‘Go wear this dress’. It’s too bad that there were not more consequences for these men.” After Look of the Year 1991, Stacy Wilkes returned to Louisville and quit school, despite having told the judges she would finish. “I thought that was the reason I lost,” she says, “so I might as well leave if I want to make it as a model. We were really broke, so I thought I’d try and make money for my mom, but it didn’t work out.” She is content with the path her life took, living in Louisville with her partner and three cats, but adds that women were raising concerns at the time and were ignored: “I think models from the 90s tried so hard, over and over, and nobody believed what we had to say.” Kate Dillon, now a businesswoman living in Seattle, remembers the contest as one that “exploited women’s assets, women’s bodies. A lot of these girls were desperate. They thought modelling was about attracting men, which it isn’t.” There was a climate of opportunism, she says. “There’s no doubt that the men were like, ‘Yes, Look of the Year week, let’s make sure my schedule is clear to have chicks over to my apartment.’ “What’s great is that we now have a language, and a precedent of young people saying: ‘No, I’m not going to let this continue’,” Dillon adds. “They would never accept being treated the way I was.” \\n  If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication). \\n  The Guardian will continue to investigate the issues raised in this story.

NEW YORK — President Trump and three of his adult children have been ordered by a federal judge to search through 15 years of business records for materials that could inform a lawsuit alleging they profited by promoting a marketing scam targeting vulnerable investors. Trump is being sued by four people who say they were duped into joining the multilevel marketing company ACN years ago because of his endorsement. The suit characterizes ACN as a pyramid scheme and accuses Trump of having made misleading claims as a paid pitchman prior to his presidency. All four say they suffered financially as a result.  The order on Friday by U.S. District Court Judge Lorna Schofield allows the plaintiffs to look further into the Trump Organization’s history — to 2005 — for others who may have been involved in the president’s deal with ACN. The suit, filed in Manhattan federal court, dates to October 2018. Racketeering claims were dismissed but state-level fraud charges were allowed to proceed and the document-production process known as discovery is well underway. That could turn up names of people at the president’s family-run real estate company and other entities under its control whom the plaintiffs could seek to depose. “We look forward to working with defendants,” attorney Roberta Kaplan said in a statement. “We continue to make every effort to gather the evidence we need to obtain justice for our brave clients, and the thousands of other Americans just like them who were defrauded by the Trumps.” A lawyer for Trump, Joanna Hendon, did not respond to a request for comment on the judge’s order. The president faces the possibility of testifying under oath in several personal lawsuits, matters that could prove problematic for him politically if he’s forced to discuss them publicly in the run-up to November’s election. He was served with a notice in this case to be deposed at the White House on May 1 and “continuing from day to day thereafter until completed,” according to a court filing. Kaplan’s team has said it would accommodate the president’s demanding schedule. His lawyers have not yet responded to the notice but are likely to seek a delay. In this case, unlike in others, he has not asserted presidential immunity as a defense, and his legal team has already turned over a number of documents. A defamation lawsuit brought by “Celebrity Apprentice” contestant Summer Zervos is in a holding pattern in Manhattan while the state’s highest court considers Trump’s immunity claim. Zervos said Trump sexually assaulted her in 2007, and he’s accused of trashing her publicly when she came forward during his 2016 presidential campaign. A similar defamation case was brought by journalist E. Jean Carroll, who went public with an accusation of rape against Trump in a memoir she published last year, could also be put on hold if a judge rules that it should track with the Zervos case. Trump has denied both women’s claims of sexual assault. The presidential immunity question also is before the U.S. Supreme Court, which has said it will hear whether Trump can shield his financial records from Congress and the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. The ACN participants who are suing Trump say they invested in the company because the wealthy celebrity businessman made promises they believed. They paid $499 buy-in fees to start and faced other expenses as time went on, they say. A California hospice caregiver who joined in 2014 took it to heart when Trump, with his children at his side on “Celebrity Apprentice,” praised ACN as a “great opportunity” that did not carry “the risk most entrepreneurs have to take,” according to the civil complaint. “In the two years that followed, [Jane Doe] paid thousands of dollars in fees and expenses to attend ACN events and host ACN meetings in an effort to succeed with the business,” the complaint says. ACN is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, but the company is cited throughout court records. Its model is to recruit “independent business owners” to its army of salespeople for communications and utilities services, like high-speed Internet plans, the suit says.   A lawyer for the company did not respond to a request for comment.   Trump was paid for ACN-related speaking engagements, making $450,000 for each of three appearances in 2014 and 2015, court papers say, citing a financial disclosure. The lawsuit says he made millions of dollars overall in his years of lending his name to the ACN brand. Lawyers for Trump, the Trump Organization, Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump sought to limit the scope of document production to five years prior to the filing of the lawsuit in 2018. “Discovery is supposed to be proportional to the needs of the case,” Hendon said in a conference call with the judge Thursday, prior to the order. Hendon argued that document production should be relatively limited and argued that Trump is known for not using email. Business for Trump is conducted largely through talks with his personal assistant, according to the lawyer. “There’s a small number of people that he dealt with on this issue,” Hendon added.   The Trump administration has offered a German medical company “large sums of money” for exclusive access to a Covid-19 vaccine, German media have reported. The German government is trying to fight off what it sees as an aggressive takeover bid by the US, the broadsheet Die Welt reports, citing German government circles. The US president had offered the Tübingen-based biopharmaceutical company CureVac “large sums of money” to gain exclusive access to their work, wrote Die Welt.  Q&AHow can I protect myself and others from the coronavirus outbreak?Show The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agency\\xa0advises\\xa0people to:  Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers Advice about face masks varies. Wearing them while out and about may offer some protection against both spreading and catching the virus via coughs and sneezes, but it is not a cast-iron guarantee of protection  Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\\xa0 In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\\xa0stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people,\\xa0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.    According to an anonymous source quoted in the newspaper, Trump was doing everything to secure a vaccine against the coronavirus for the US, “but for the US only”. The German government was reportedly offering its own financial incentives for the vaccine to stay in the country. The German health minister Jens Spahn said that a takeover of the CureVac company by the Trump administration was “off the table”. CureVac would only develop vaccine “for the whole world”, Spahn said, “not for individual countries”. Earlier, when approached about the report by the Guardian, the German health ministry would only confirm the accuracy of the quotes attributed to one of its spokespersons in the article. “The federal government is very interested in vaccines and antiviral agents against the novel coronavirus being developed in Germany and Europe,” the spokesperson quoted in the original article had said. “In this regard the government is in an intensive exchange with the company CureVac.” The German health ministry spokesperson declined the opportunity to correct any inaccuracies in Die Welt’s account. With its headquarters in the south-western German city of Tübingen, CureVac also has sites in Frankfurt and Boston in the US. Linked with the German health ministry, it works closely with the Paul Ehrlich Institute, a research institution and medical regulatory body that is subordinate to the German health ministry.     On 11 March, CureVac released a statement that its CEO, the US citizen Daniel Menichella, was unexpectedly leaving the firm and would be replaced by the company’s founder, Ingmar Hoerr. At the start of the month, Menichella was invited to the White House in Washington to discuss strategy for the rapid development and production of a coronavirus vaccine with Trump, the vice-president, Mike Pence, and members of the White House coronavirus task force. The White House has been contacted for comment.

The president invited a procession of corporate chieftains, who — along with his faithful vice-president — lavished him with his customary praise. The purpose was to make Trump look, if only superficially, like a regular president.\\n Trump immediately sabotaged the display by eschewing his prepared text. CNN reported that Trump attributed his disastrous speech Wednesday night on his teleprompter (Trump “complained about the teleprompter from which he read the speech, blaming it for various stumbles including his inaccurate announcement that cargo would be included in the travel ban.”) Perhaps in reaction, this speech used prepared notes instead.\\n But this decision led to Trump’s characteristic habit of interspersing bullet point notes with little riffs, which create the appearance of a man encountering the words for the first time. “I am officially declaring a national emergency, two very big words.” When he announced his intention to have the federal government buy and store excess oil, he added the move was “Making us even further toward that wonderful goal that we’ve already achieved, of energy independence,” simultaneously announcing the goal would get closer but had already been achieved. He touted the decision by several athletic leagues to halt play: “It’s incredible what’s happening with sports. With the sports … Problems could be caused.”\\n The contrast in semantic fluency between Trump and the parade of business figures he invited to speak only underscored his haplessness. They were able to speak in complete sentences and use high school-level vocabulary terms, while he couldn’t. Trump even persisted in offering a series of handshakes — a practice health authorities are trying to eradicate — until one of the executives offered an elbow bump instead. The all-but-explicit message is that the federal government, and its oafish leader, is so inept that only the private sector is able to save us.\\n Trump tried to reassure his audience that his corporate partners had finally resolved the testing crisis that had left the United States, almost singularly in the world, unable to determine how many Americans had contracted the coronavirus. Trump repeated again his boast that fewer Americans had the coronavirus than in other countries. “Frankly, the numbers, because of the steps that have been taken, are at a level that a lot of people are surprised, especially when you compare them with other places, with far smaller populations,” he bragged. Of course the numbers may well be lower only because the United States has almost no capacity to find out how many Americans are infected. The number Trump is citing as his measure of success is the measure of failure.\\n Trump attempted to blame the government’s failure to deploy tests on the Obama administration, which has departed more than three years ago. The shirking of responsibility is self-evidently absurd: if Obama’s supposed red tape had prevented the Centers for Disease Control from handling the coronavirus, why didn’t Trump cut through it weeks ago, when the virus first alarmed health officials?\\n A reporter asked the president if he took responsibility for the failure of the government he leads to resolve this sooner. “No,” he replied, “I don’t take responsibility at all”.\\n Another reporter asked if he took responsibility for dissolving the White House office charged with coordinating responses to pandemics. (Beth Cameron, its former director, has an op-ed explaining how damaging this move was.) Trump denied any responsibility for this decision, too. “You say me, I didn’t do it … I don’t know about that,” he huffed, calling the query a “nasty question,” and cutting off the reporter’s microphone.\\n Harry Truman once said, “The buck stops here.” It is the most hackneyed cliche about the presidency, and leadership in general. Trump has never had to follow this principle, in a career that ran from inheriting $400 million from his father through various bankruptcies. Trump instead follows the ethos of a different famous leader — Tony Soprano, who once said, “Shit runs down hill, money goes up.”\\n Trump’s most historically bizarre belief is that he can not only claim credit for every good thing that happens under his watch — primarily the continuation of the recovery he inherited — while shirking responsibility for all the bad onto others. The longer he holds office, the the ratio of the former to the latter continues to shrink. He is likely to discover that pretending to be a real president is not enough.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n President Trump: ‘I Don’t Take Responsibility at All’\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n  \\n\\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\\n\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday deflected blame for his administration’s lagging ability to test Americans for the coronavirus outbreak, insisting instead — without offering evidence — that fault lies with his predecessor, Barack Obama.\\n“I don’t take responsibility at all,” Trump said defiantly, pointing to an unspecified “set of circumstances” and “rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.” \\nThe remarks from the president came in response to questions at a Friday press conference about the lack of widespread access to testing, an aspect of his administration’s coronavirus response that has been the subject of widespread, steady criticism. Administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that the U.S. tested about 11,000 people during the first seven weeks of the outbreak — roughly as many as South Korea is testing each day. \\n \\nAnd Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee on Thursday that “the system is not really geared to what we need right now” in and called the testing system “a failing.” \\nBut Trump, who spent weeks downplaying coronavirus before declaring it a national emergency on Friday, argued that the health care system was not designed for an outbreak on the scale of coronavirus, “with the kind of numbers that we are talking about.” \\nThe president kept his criticism lighter and more forward-looking at first, declaring that his administration is “leaving a very indelible print in the future in case something like this happens again.” \\n“That’s not the fault of anybody — and frankly the old system worked very well for smaller numbers, much smaller numbers but not for these kind of numbers,” he added.\\nBut then Fauci stepped up to the mic to clarify his position, arguing that the CDC’s testing system, “for what it was designed for, it worked very well,” and maintaining that an “embrace” of the private sector was necessary for testing at the kind of scale needed for the fast-spreading coronavirus. \\nThen, Trump began pointing fingers. \\n“If you go back — please, if you go back to the swine flu, it was nothing like this. they didn’t do testing like this,” he interjected, referencing the 2009 H1N1 pandemic that sickened more than 60 million people between April 2009 and 2010. Trump asserted that the Obama administration “didn’t do testing” and that when “they started thinking about testing,” it was “far too late.”\\nHe reiterated a claim made on Twitter earlier in the day, calling the Obama administration’s response to the swine flu outbreak “a very big failure,” though the H1N1’s fatality rate of .02 percent is much lower than the lowest fatality estimates for the coronavirus thus far. \\nTrump later got testy with another reporter who pressed him on whether he bore any responsibility for the surge in cases, noting that he’d disbanded the White House’s pandemic office.\\nTrump told the reporter, PBS NewsHour’s Yamiche Alcindor — with whom he’s butted heads with in the past — that her inquiry was a “nasty question.” \\nAfter noting that his administration had quickly acted to restrict travel from China, where the coronavirus outbreak originated, the president said he personally was not responsible for dissolving the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, which had been part of the National Security Council until his administration disbanded it and rolled its officials into another office.\\n“And when you say me, I didn’t do it. We have a group of people. I could ask — perhaps in my administration — but I could perhaps ask Tony about that because I don’t know anything about it.” Trump said. “You say we did that. I don’t know anything about it.”\\nHe continued: “I don’t know, CDC, perhaps they do that — let people go. You used to be with a different newspaper than you are now. You know, things like that happen.”\\nTrump then began to move on, before returning to defend his administration’s response. \\n“We are doing a great job,” he insisted, referencing the health officials and business executives gathered behind him. “Let me tell you, these professionals behind me and these great incredible doctors and business people — the best in the world — and I can say that whether it’s retailers or labs or anything you want to say. These are the best in the world.” \\nHe also pointed to the number of fatalities in the U.S. attributed to the virus, which has hit 40 in the several weeks since the first reported case in the U.S., and is significantly lower than other countries hit hardest by the disease. \\n“Compare that with other countries that are many, many times that amount,” Trump said. “One of the reasons we have 40 and others have and, again, that number is going up just so you understand.”\\nTrump’s criticism of the Obama administration on Friday wasn’t limited to its response to its own pandemic.\\nAt another point in the press conference, Trump appeared to work in a shot at healthcare.gov, the website created by the Obama administration for the rollout of the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance exchanges that was infamously marred by connectivity issues almost instantly when it debuted.\\nAnnouncing that Google had offered to assist the White House in the creation of a website to better help Americans determine whether they needed to be tested for coronavirus and where to get tested if so, Trump quipped that the tech “is helping to develop a website that will be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past.” \\n \\n \\n We have an old custom here at Mar-a-Lago,\" Donald Trump was saying one night at dinner in his 118-room winter palace in Palm Beach. \\'\\'Our custom is to go around the table after dinner and introduce ourselves to each other.\" Trump had seemed fidgety that night, understandably eager to move the dinner party along so that he could go to bed.\\n\\'\\'Old custom? He\\'s only had Mrs. Post\\'s house a few months. Really! I\\'m going home,\" one Palm Beach resident whispered to his date.\\n\\'\\'Oh, stay,\" she said. \\'\\'It will be so amusing.\"\\nIt was spring, four years ago. Donald and Ivana Trump were seated at opposite ends of their long Sheraton table in Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather Post\\'s former dining room. They were posed in imperial style, as if they were a king and queen. They were at the height of their ride, and it was plenty glorious. Trump was seen on the news shows offering his services to negotiate with the Russians. There was talk that he might make a run for president. Ivana had had so much publicity that she now offered interviewers a press kit of flattering clips. Anything seemed possible, the Trumps had grown to such stature in the golden city of New York.\\nIt was balmy that night in Palm Beach; Ivana wore a strapless dress. The air was redolent with the fragrance of oleander and bougainvillea, mingled with the slight smell of mildew which clung to the old house. To his credit, Trump had no interest in mastering the Palm Beach style of navy blazers and linen trousers. Often he wore a business suit to his table; his only concession to local custom was to wear a pink tie or pale shoes. To her credit, Ivana still served the dinners her husband preferred, so on that warm night the guests ate beef with potatoes. Mrs. Post\\'s faux-Tiepolo ceiling remained in the dining room, but an immense silver bowl now rested in the center of the table, filled with plastic fruit. As always, it was business with the Trumps, for that was their common purpose, the bond between them. In recent years, they never seemed to touch each other or exchange intimate remarks in public. They had become less like man and wife and more like two ambassadors from different countries, each with a separate agenda.\\nThe Trumps had bought Mar-a-Lago only a few months earlier, but already they had become Palm Beach curiosities. Across the road was the Bath and Tennis Club, \\'\\'the B and T,\" as the locals called it, and it was said that the Trumps had yet to be invited to join. \\'\\'Utter bullshit! They kiss my ass in Palm Beach,\" Trump told me recently. \\'\\'Those phonies! That club called me and asked me if they could have my consent to use part of my beach to expand the space for their cabanas! I said, \\'Of course!\\' Do you think if I wanted to be a member they would have turned me down? I wouldn\\'t join that club, because they don\\'t take blacks and Jews.\"\\nAs if Mar-a-Lago and the Trump Princess yacht were James Gatz\\'s West Egg estate, invitations were much prized, for the local snobs loved to dine out on tales of the Trumps. And now this! Embarrassing their guests by having them make speeches, as if they were at a sales convention!\\nWhen it was Ivana\\'s turn to introduce herself that night, she rose quickly. \"I am married to the most wonderful husband. He is so generous and smart. We are so lucky to have this life.\" She was desperately playing to him, but Donald said nothing in return. He seemed tired of hearing Ivana\\'s endless praise; her subservient quality appeared to be getting to him. Perhaps he was spoiling for something to excite him, like a fight. Maybe all the public posturing was beginning to get boring, too. \\'\\'Well, I\\'m done,\" he said before dessert, tossing his napkin on the table and vanishing from the room.\\nPalm Beach had been Ivana Trump\\'s idea. Long ago, Donald had screamed at her, \"I want nothing social that you aspire to. If that is what makes you happy, get another husband!\" But she had no intention of doing that, for Ivana, like Donald, was living out a fantasy. She had seen that in the Trump life everything and everybody appeared to come with a price, or a marker for future use. Ivana had learned to look through Donald with glazed eyes when he said to close friends, as he had in the early years of their marriage, \"I would never buy Ivana any decent jewels or pictures. Why give her negotiable assets?\" She had gotten out of Eastern Europe by being tough and highly disciplined, and she had compounded her skills through her husband, the master manipulator. She had learned the lingua franca in a world where everyone seemed to be using everyone else in a relentless drive for power. How was she to know that there was another way to live? Besides, she often told her friends, however cruel Donald could be, she was very much in love with him.\\nThis night Ivana had managed to wedge in the publisher of the local social paper, \\'\\'the Shiny Sheet.\" As usual, Donald\\'s weekend guests were paybacks, for he trusted few people. He had invited one of his construction executives, the mayor of West Palm Beach, and the former governor of New York, Hugh Carey, who in his days running the state as \"Society Carey,\" boosted by huge Trump donations, had been crucial to Trump\\'s early success.\\nFor years, Ivana appeared to have studied the public behavior of the royals. Her friends now called this \"Ivana\\'s imperial-couple syndrome,\" and they teased her about it, for they knew that Ivana, like Donald, was inventing and reinventing herself all the time. When she had first come to New York, she wore elaborate helmet hairdos and bouffant satin dresses, very Hollywood; her image of rich American women probably came from the movies she had seen as a child. Ivana had now spent years passing through the fine rooms of New York, but she had never seemed to learn the real way of the truly rich, the art of understatement. Instead, she had become regal, filling her houses with the kind of ormolu found in palaces in Eastern Europe. She had taken to waving to friends with tiny hand motions, as if to conserve her energy. At her own charity receptions, she insisted that she and Donald form a receiving line, and she would stand in pinpoint heels, never sinking into the deep grass—such was her control.\\nThis spring night, a squad of servants had been outside to greet the guests, as if they had arrived at Cliveden between the wars. Most of the staff, however, were not a permanent part of Mar-a-Lago; they were local caterers and car parks, hired for the evening. In addition to the dining-room ceiling, Ivana had left Mrs. Post\\'s shabby fringed sofas and Moroccan suites totally in place, giving the impression that she was trying on Mrs. Post\\'s persona too. One of the few signs of the new owners\\' taste was the dozens of silver frames on the many end tables. The frames did not contain family pictures, but magazine covers. Each cover featured the face of Donald Trump.\\nWhen the Trump plane landed in Palm Beach, two cars were usually waiting, the first a Rolls-Royce for the adults, the second a station wagon for the children, the nannies, and a bodyguard. Occasionally, state troopers were on hand to speed the Trump motorcade along. This took a certain amount of planning and coordination, but the effort was crucial for what Ivana was trying to achieve. \"In fifty years Donald and I will be considered old money like the Vanderbilts,\" she once told the writer Dominick Dunne.\\nThis past April, when his empire was in danger of\\xa0collapse, Trump isolated himself in a small apartment on a lower floor of Trump Tower. He would lie on his bed, staring at the ceiling, talking into the night on the telephone. The Trumps had separated. Ivana remained upstairs in the family triplex with its beige onyx floors and low-ceilinged living room painted with murals in the style of Michelangelo. The murals had occasioned one of their frequent fights: Ivana wanted cherubs, Donald preferred warriors. The warriors won. \"If this were on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, it would be very much in place in terms of quality,\" Trump once said of the work. That April, Ivana began to tell her friends that she was worried about Donald\\'s state of mind.\\nShe had been completely humiliated by Donald through his public association with Marla Maples. \"How can you say you love us? You don\\'t love us! You don\\'t even love yourself. You just love your money,\" twelve-year-old Donald junior told his father, according to friends of Ivana\\'s. \"What kind of son have I created?\" Trump\\'s mother, Mary, is said to have asked Ivana.\\nDeveloper Sam Lefrak would say of Donald Trump, \"A peacock today, a feather duster tomorrow.\"\\nHowever unlikely it seemed, Ivana was now considered a tabloid heroine, and her popularity seemed in inverse proportion to the fickle city\\'s new dislike of her husband. \\'\\'Ivana is now a media goddess on par with Princess Di, Madonna, and Elizabeth Taylor,\" Liz Smith reported. Months earlier, Ivana had undergone cosmetic reconstruction with a California doctor. She emerged unrecognizable to her friends and perhaps her children, as fresh and innocent of face as Heidi of Edelweiss Farms. Although she had negotiated four separate marital-property agreements over the last fourteen years, she was suing her husband for half his assets. Trump was trying to be philosophical. \\'\\'When a man leaves a woman, especially when it was perceived that he has left for a piece of ass—a good one!—there are 50 percent of the population who will love the woman who was left,\" he told me.\\nIvana had hired a public-relations man to help her in her new role. \\'\\'This is all very calculated,\" one of her advisers told me. \\'\\'Ivana is very shrewd. She\\'s playing it to the hilt.\"\\nMany floors beneath the Trumps, Japanese tourists roamed the Trump Tower lobby with their cameras. Inevitably, they took pictures of the display of Trump\\'s familiar portrait from the cover of his book Trump: The Art of the Deal, which was propped on an easel outside the Trump Tower real-estate office. The Japanese still took Donald Trump to be the very image of power and money, and seemed to believe, as Trump once had, that this red-marble-and-brass monument was the center of the world.\\nFor days, Trump rarely left his building. Hamburgers and French fries were sent up to him from the nearby New York Delicatessen. His body ballooned, his hair curled down his neck. \\'\\'You remind me of Howard Hughes,\" a friend told him. \\'\\'Thanks,\" Trump replied, \\'\\'I admire him.\" On the telephone he sounded ebullient, without a care, as confident as the image he projected in his lobby portrait.\\nLike John Connally, the former governor of Texas, Trump had millions of dollars signed away in personal guarantees. The personal debt on the Trump Shuttle alone was $135 million. Bear Stearns had been guaranteed $56 million for Trump\\'s Alexander\\'s and American Airlines positions. The Taj Mahal casino had a complicated set of provisions which made Trump responsible for $35 million. Trump had personally guaranteed $125 million for the Plaza hotel. In West Palm Beach, Trump Plaza was so empty it was nicknamed \\'\\'the Trump See-Through.\" That building alone carried $14 million worth of personal debt. Trump\\'s mansions in Greenwich and Palm Beach, as well as the yacht, had been promised to the banks for $40 million in outstanding loans. The Wall Street Journal estimated that Trump\\'s guarantees could exceed $600 million. In one astonishing decade, Donald Trump had become the Brazil of Manhattan.\\n\\'Anybody who is anybody sits between the columns. The food is the worst, but you\\'ll see everybody here,\" Donald Trump told me ten years ago at the \"21\" Club. Donald had already cut a swath in this preserve of the New York establishment; we were immediately seated between the columns in the old upstairs room, then decorated with black paneling and red Naugahyde banquettes. It was the autumn of 1980, a fine season in New York. The Yankees were in the pennant race; a movie star was running for president and using the term \\' \\'deregulation\" in his campaign. Donald was new then, thirty-four years old and very brash, just beginning to make copy and loving it. He was already fodder for the dailies and the weeklies, but he was desperate for national attention. \\'\\'Did you see that The New York Times said I looked like Robert Redford?\" he asked me.\\nTrump hasn\\'t changed much physically in the last ten years. Then, as now, he was all cheeks and jaw, with a tendency to look soft in the middle. He retains the blond hair, youthful swagger, and elastic face that give him the quality of the cartoon tough Baby Huey. Trump is a head swiveler, always looking around to see who else is in the room. As a boy, he was equally restless. \\'\\'Donald was the child who would throw the cake at the birthday parties,\" his brother Robert once told me. \\'\\'If I built the bricks up, Donald would come along and glue them all together, and that would be the end of my bricks.\"\\nHe was already married to Ivana, a former model and athlete from Czechoslovakia. One night in 1976, Trump had been at the bar in Maxwell\\'s Plum. Maxwell\\'s Plum is gone now, but the very name evokes the era of frantic singles underneath the Art Nouveau ceiling. It was the place where flight attendants hoped to find bankers, and models looked for dates. Donald met his model, Ivana Zelnickova, visiting from Montreal. She liked to tell the story of how she had gone skiing with Donald, pretending to be a learner like him, and then humiliated him by whizzing past him down the slopes.\\nThey were married in New York during Easter of 1977. Mayor Beame attended the wedding at Marble Collegiate Church. Donald had already made his alliance with Roy Cohn, who would become his lawyer and mentor. Shortly before the wedding, Donald reportedly told Ivana, \"You have to sign this agreement.\" \"What is this?\" she asked. \"Just a document that will protect my family money.\" Cohn gallantly offered to find Ivana a lawyer. \"We don\\'t have these documents in Czechoslovakia,\" Ivana reportedly said, but she told friends that she was terrified of Cohn and his power over Donald. The first agreement gave Ivana $20,000 a year. Two years later, Trump had made his own fortune. \"You better redo the agreement, Donald,\" Cohn reportedly told him. \"Otherwise you\\'re going to look hard and greedy.\" Ivana resisted. \"You don\\'t like it, stick to the old agreement,\" Trump is said to have replied.\\nDonald was determined to have a large family. \"I want five children, like in my own family, because with five, then I will know that one will be guaranteed to turn out like me,\" Donald told a close friend. He was willing to be generous with Ivana, and a story went around that he was giving her a cash bonus of $250,000 for each child.\\nThe Trumps and their baby, Donald junior, lived in a Fifth Avenue apartment decorated with beige velvet sectional sofas and a bone-and-goatskin table from the Italian furniture store Casa Bella. They had a collection of Steuben glass animals which they displayed on glass shelves in the front hall. The shelves were outlined with a string of tiny white lights usually seen on a Christmas tree.\\nDonald was trying to make time in the world of aesthetes and little black cocktail dresses. He had just completed the Grand Hyatt, on East Forty-second Street, and was considered a comer. He had put together the Fifth Avenue parcel that would become Trump Tower and had enraged the city establishment with his demolition of the cherished Art Deco friezes that had decorated the Bon wit Teller building. Even then, Trump\\'s style was to turn on his audience.\\n\"What do you think? Do you think blowing up the sculptures has hurt me?\" he asked me that day at \"21.\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Who cares?\" he said. \"Let\\'s say that I had given that junk to the Met. They would have just put them in their basement. I\\'ll never have the goodwill of the Establishment, the tastemakers of New York. Do you think, if I failed, these guys in New York would be unhappy? They would be thrilled! Because they have never tried anything on the scale that I am trying things in this city. I don\\'t care about their goodwill.\"\\nDonald was like an overgrown kid, all rough edges and inflated ego. He had brought the broad style of Brooklyn and Queens into Manhattan, flouting what he considered effete conventions, such as landmark preservation. His suits were badly cut, with wide cuffs on his trousers; he was a shade away from cigars. \"I don\\'t put on any airs,\" he told me. He tooled around New York in a silver Cadillac with \"DJT plates and tinted windows and had a former city cop for his driver.\\nDonald and I were not alone at lunch that day. He had invited Stanley Friedman to join us. Friedman was a partner of Roy Cohn\\'s and, like Cohn, a legend in the city. He was part of the Bronx political machine, and would soon be appointed the Bronx County leader. Later, Friedman would go to jail for his role in the city parking-meter scandal. Trump and Friedman spent most of our lunch swapping stories about Roy Cohn. \"Roy could fix anyone in the city,\" Friedman told me. \"He\\'s a genius.\" \"He\\'s a lousy lawyer, but he\\'s a genius,\" Trump said.\\nAt one point, Preston Robert Tisch, known to all as Bob, came into the upstairs room at \"21.\" Bob Tisch and his brother, Laurence, now the head of CBS, had made their fortune in New York and Florida real estate and hotels. Bob Tisch, like his brother, was a city booster, a man of goodwill and manners, a benefactor of hospitals and universities.\\n\"I beat Bob Tisch on the convention-center site,\" Donald said loudly when Tisch stopped by our table. \"But we\\'re friends now, good friends, isn\\'t that right, Bob? Isn\\'t that right?\"\\nBob Tisch\\'s smile remained on his face, but there was a sudden strain in his tone, as if a child had misbehaved. \"Oh yes, Donald,\" he said, \"good friends. Very good friends.\"\\n\"Donald is a believer in the big-lie theory.\\xa0If you say something again and again,\\xa0people will believe you.\"\\nLate on summer Friday afternoons, the city of noise takes on an eerie quiet. In June I was with one of Donald Trump\\'s more combative lawyers. \"We certainly won\\'t win in the popular press,\\'\\' he told me, \"but we will win. You\\'ll see.\\'\\' I thought of Trump a few blocks away, isolated in Trump Tower, fighting for his financial life.\\nThe phone rang several times. \"Yeah, yeah? Is that so?\" the lawyer said, and then laughed at the sheer—as he phrased it—\"brass balls\" of his client, standing up to the numbers guys who were representing Chase Manhattan and Bankers Trust, whom he was into for hundreds of millions of dollars. \"Donald\\'s very up. This is the kind of challenge Donald likes,\" the lawyer told me. \"It\\'s weird. You would never know anything is wrong.\" \"Don\\'t believe anything you read in the papers,\" Trump had told his publisher Joni Evans. \"When they hear the good news about me, what are they going to do?\" Random House was rushing to publish his new book, Trump: Surviving at the Top, with a first printing of 500,000.\\nIn the Trump Tower conference room that week, one lawyer had reportedly told Trump the obvious: the Plaza hotel might never bring the $400 million he had paid for it. Trump stayed cool. \"Get me the Sultan of Brunei on the telephone,\" he said. \"I have a personal guarantee that the Sultan of Brunei will take me out of the Plaza at an immense profit.\"\\nThe bankers and lawyers in the conference room looked at Trump with a combination of awe and disbelief. Whatever their cynical instincts, Trump, the Music Man of real estate, could set off in them the power of imagination, for his real skill has always been his ability to convince others of his possibilities. The line between a con man and an entrepreneur is often fuzzy. \\' \\'They say the Plaza is worth $400 million? Trump says it\\'s worth $800 million. Who the hell knows what it is worth? I can tell you one thing: it is worth a lot more than I paid for it, \" Trump told me. \"When Forbes puts low values on all my properties, they say I am only worth $500 million! Well, that\\'s $500 million more than I started with.\"\\nHe began belittling her: \"That dress is terrible.\" \"You\\'re showing too much cleavage.\" \"Who would touch those plastic breasts?\\'\\'\\n\\'Do people really think I am in trouble?\\'\\' Trump asked me recently.\\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"they think you\\'re finished.\"\\nIt was an afternoon in July, when the dust seemed to be settling, and we were in the middle of a two-hour phone conversation. The conversation itself was a negotiation. Trump attempted to put me on the defensive. I had written about him ten years before. Trump had talked about a close friend of his who was the son of a famous New York real-estate developer. \"I told him to get out from under his father\\'s thumb,\" Trump told me then. \"That was off the record,\" Trump told me now. I looked up my old notes. \"Wrong, Donald,\" I said. \"What was off the record was when you attacked your other friend and said he was an alcoholic.\\'\\' Without missing a beat, Trump said, \"I believe you.\" Then Trump laughed. \"Some things never change.\"\\n\"Just wait five years,\" Trump told me. \"This is really a no-brainer. Just like the Merv Griffin deal. When I took him to the cleaners, the press wanted me to lose. They said, \\'Holy shit! Trump got taken!\\' Let me tell you something. It\\'s good for me to be thought of as poor right now. You wouldn\\'t believe some of the deals I am making! I guess I have a perverse personality. ... I\\'ve really enjoyed the last few weeks,\" he said, as if he had been rejuvenated at a spa.\\nDeals had always been his only art. He was reportedly getting unbelievable deals now from the contractors he had hired to build his casinos and the fiberglass elephants that decorate the Boardwalk in front of the Taj Mahal, for they were desperate, unsure that they would ever get paid for months of work. Trump was famous for his skill at squeezing every last bit out of his transactions. He was known to be making shocking deals now that he never could have made two months before. \"Trump won\\'t do a deal unless there\\'s something extra—a kind of moral larceny—in it,\" one of his rivals once said of him. \"Things had gotten too easy for me,\" Trump told me. \"I made a lot of money and I made it too easily, to the point of boredom. Anything I did worked! I took on Bally, I made $32 million. After a while it was too easy.\"\\nThe fear of boredom has always loomed large in Trump\\'s life. He has a short attention span. He even gave the appearance of having grown bored with his wife. He told me he had grown weary of his deals, his companies, \"New York phonies,\" \"Palm Beach phonies,\" most social people, \"negative\" writers, and \"negatives\" in general. \"You keep hitting and hitting and hitting, and after a while it doesn\\'t mean as much to you,\" Trump told me. \"Hey, when you first knew me, I basically had done nothing! So I had built a building or two, big deal.\"\\nThat morning, Trump had been yet again on the front page of the New York Daily News, because Forbes had dropped him off the list of the world\\'s richest men, placing his net worth at $500 million, down from $1.7 billion in 1989. \"They put me on the front page for this bullshit reason!\" Trump said. \"If they put me on the cover of the Daily News, they sell more papers! They put me on the cover of the Daily News today with wars breaking out! You know why? Malcolm Forbes got thrown out of the Plaza by me! You know the story about me and Malcolm Forbes, when I kicked him out of the Plaza hotel? No? Well, I did. You\\'ll read all about it in my new book. And I didn\\'t throw him out because he didn\\'t pay his bill. So I\\'ve been expecting this attack from Forbes. The same writer who wrote about this also wrote that Merv kicked my ass! The same writer is under investigation. You heard about that, didn\\'t you?\" (A Forbes writer is under investigation—for alleged use of outdated police credentials. He did not write that Trump was taken by Merv Griffin.) \"What happened to me is what is happening in every company in America right now. There is not a company in America that isn\\'t restructuring! Didn\\'t you see The Wall Street Journal this morning about Revlon? What is going on at Revlon is what has happened to Donald Trump. But no one makes Revlon a front-page story. My problems didn\\'t even merit a column in The Wall Street Journal.\"\\xa0(Revlon was selling $182 million worth of stock to raise cash, but that was hardly the same as Trump\\'s crisis.)\\nTrump spoke in a hypnotic, unending torrent of words. Often he appeared to free-associate. He referred to himself in the third person: \"Trump says. . . Trump believes.\" His phrases skibbled around and doubled back on themselves like fireworks in a summer sky. He reminded me of a carnival barker trying to fill his tent. \"I\\'m more popular now than I was two months ago. There are two publics as far as I\\'m concerned. The real public and then there\\'s the New York society horseshit. The real public has always liked Donald Trump. The real public feels that Donald Trump is going through Trump-bashing. When I go out now, forget about it. I\\'m mobbed. It\\'s bedlam,\" Trump told me.\\nTrump is often belligerent, as if to pep things up. On the telephone with me, he attacked a local writer as \"a disgrace\" and savaged a financier\\'s wife I knew as \"a giant, a three in the looks department.\" After the Resorts International deal, at a New Year\\'s Eve party at the Aspen home of Barbara Walters and Merv Adelson, Trump was asked to make a wish for the coming year. \"I wish I had another Merv Griffin to bat around,\" he said.\\nBefore the opening of the Taj Mahal, Marvin Roffman, a financial analyst from Philadelphia, correctly stated that the Taj was in for a rough ride. For that, Roffman believes, Trump had him fired. \"Is that why you attacked him?\" I asked Trump. \"I\\'d do it again. Here\\'s a guy that used to call me, begging me to buy stock through him, with the implication that if I\\'d buy stock he\\'d give me positive comments.\" \"Are you accusing him of fraud?\" I asked. \"I\\'m accusing him of being not very good at what he does.\" Congressman John Dingell of Michigan asked the S.E.C. to investigate the circumstances of Roffman\\'s firing. When I asked Roffman about Trump\\'s charges he said, \"That\\'s the most unbelievable garbage I\\'ve ever heard in my entire life.\" Roffman\\'s attorney James Schwartzman called Trump\\'s allegations \"the desperate act of a desperate man.\" Roffman is now suing Trump for defamation of character.\\n\"Donald is a believer in the big-lie theory,\" his lawyer had told me. \"If you say something again and again, people will believe you.\"\\n\"One of my lawyers said that?\" Trump said when I asked him about it. \"I think if one of my lawyers said that, I\\'d like to know who it is, because I\\'d fire his ass. I\\'d like to find out who the scumbag is!\"\\nOne of Trump\\'s first major deals in New York was to acquire a large tract of land on West Thirty-fourth Street being offered by the bankrupt Penn Central railroad. Trump submitted a plan for a convention center to city officials. \"He told us he\\'d forgo his $4.4 million fee if we would name the new convention center after his father,\" former deputy mayor Peter Solomon said. \"Someone finally read the contract. He wasn\\'t entitled to anywhere near the money he was claiming. It was unbelievable. He almost got us to name the convention center after his father in return for something he never really had to give away.\"\\nTrump\\'s first major real-estate coup in New York was the acquisition of the Commodore Hotel, which would become the Grand Hyatt. This deal, secured with a controversial tax abatement from the city, made Trump\\'s reputation. His partner at the time was the well-respected Pritzker family of Chicago, who owned the Hyatt chain. Their contract was specific: Trump and Jay Pritzker agreed that if there were any sticking points they would have a ten-day period to arbitrate their differences. At one point, they had a minor disagreement. \"Jay Pritzker was leaving for a trip to Nepal, where he was to be incommunicado,\" a lawyer for the Pritzker family told me. \"Donald waited until Jay was in the airplane before he called him. Naturally, Jay couldn\\'t call him back. He was on a mountain in Nepal. Later, Donald kept saying, \\'I tried to call you. I gave you the ten days. But you were in Nepal.\\' It was outrageous. Pritzker was his partner, not his enemy! This is how he acted on his first important deal.\" Trump later even reported the incident in his book.\\n\"Give them the old Trump bullshit,\" he told the architect Der Scutt before a presentation of the Trump Tower design at a press conference in 1980. \"Tell them it is going to be a million square feet, sixty-eight stories.\" \"I don\\'t lie, Donald,\" the architect replied.\\nEventually Trump bought out the Equitable Life Assurance company\\'s share of the commercial space in Trump Tower. \"He paid Equitable $60 million after an arm\\'s-length negotiation,\" a top real-estate developer told me. \"The equity for the entire commercial space was $120 million. Suddenly, Donald was saying that it was worth $500 million!\"\\nWhen The Art of the Deal was published, he told The Wall Street Journal that the first printing would be 200,000. It was 50,000 fewer than that.\\nWhen Charles Feldman of CNN questioned Trump in March about the collapse of his business empire, Trump stormed off the set. Later, he told Feldman\\'s boss, Ted Turner, \"Your reporter threatened my secretary and made her cry.\"\\nWhen the stock market collapsed, he announced that he had gotten out in time and had lost nothing. In fact, he had taken a beating on his Alexander\\'s and American Airlines stock. \"What I said was, other than my Alexander\\'s and American Airlines stock, I was out of the market,\" Trump told me swiftly.\\nWhat forces in Donald Trump\\'s background could have set off in him such a need for self-promotion?\\nTen years ago, I went to visit Trump\\'s father in his offices on Avenue Z on the border of Coney Island in Brooklyn. Fred Trump\\'s own real-estate fortune had been made with the help of the Brooklyn political machine and especially Abe Beame. In the 1940s, Trump and Beame shared a close friend and lawyer, a captain in a Brooklyn political club named Bunny Lindenbaum. At that time, Beame worked in the city budget office; thirty years later he would become mayor of the city. Trump, Lindenbaum, and Beame often saw one another at dinner dances and fund-raisers of the Brooklyn political clubs. It is impossible to overestimate the power of these clubs in the New York of the 1950s; they created Fred Trump and gave him access to his largest acquisition, the seventy-five-acre parcel of city land that would become the 3,800-unit Trump Village.\\nIn 1960, an immense tract of land off Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn became available for development. The City Planning Commission had approved a generous tax abatement for a nonprofit foundation to build a housing cooperative. Fred Trump attacked this abatement as \\'\\'a giveaway.\" Soon after, Trump himself decided to go after the tax abatement. Although the City Planning Commission had already approved the nonprofit plan, Lindenbaum went to see Mayor Robert Wagner, and Beame, who was in Wagner\\'s camp, supported Trump.\\nFred Trump wound up with two-thirds of the property, and within a year he had broken ground on Trump Village. Lindenbaum was given the City Planning Commission seat formerly held by Robert Moses, the power broker who built many of New York\\'s highways, airports, and parks. The following year, Lindenbaum organized a fund-raising lunch for Wagner, who was running for re-election. Forty-three builders and landlords pledged thousands of dollars; Trump, according to reporter Wayne Barrett, pledged $2,500, one of the largest contributions. The lunch party made the front page of the newspapers, and Lindenbaum, disgraced, was forced off the commission. But Robert Wagner won the election, and Beame became his comptroller.\\nIn 1966, as Donald was entering his junior year at the Wharton business school, Fred Trump and Lindenbaum were investigated for their role in a $60 million Mitchell-Lama mortgage. \"Is there any way of preventing a man who does business in that way from getting another contract with the state?\" the investigations-commission chairman asked about Trump and Lindenbaum. Ultimately, Trump was forced to return $1.2 million that he had overestimated on the land—part of which money he had used to buy a site nearby on which to build a shopping center.\\nFred Trump\\'s office was pleasantly modest; the rooms were divided by glass partitions. The Trump Organization, as Donald had already grandly taken to calling his father\\'s company, was a small cottage on the grounds of Trump Village. At the time, Donald told reporters that \"the Trump Organization\" had 22,000 units, although it had about half that number. Fred Trump was seventy-five then, polite, but nobody\\'s fool. He criticized many of his son\\'s early deals, warning him at one point that expanding into Manhattan was \"a ticket on the Titanic.\" Donald ignored him. \"A peacock today, a feather duster tomorrow,\" the developer Sam Lefrak is said to have remarked of Donald Trump. But ten years ago it was clear that Donald was the embodiment of his father\\'s dreams. \"I always tell Donald, \\'The elevator to success is out of order. Go one step at a time,\\' \" Fred Trump told me. \"But what do you think of what my Donald has put together? It boggles the mind!\"\\nDonald Trump has always viewed his father as a role model. In The Art of the Deal, he wrote, \"Fred Trump was born in New Jersey in 1905. His father, who came here from Sweden. . . owned a moderately successful restaurant.\" In fact, the Trump family was German and desperately poor. \"At one point my mother took in stitching to keep us going,\" Trump\\'s father told me. \"For a time, my father owned a restaurant in the Klondike, but he died when I was young.\" Donald\\'s cousin John Walter once wrote out an elaborate family tree. \"We shared the same grandfather,\" Walter told me, \"and he was German. So what?\"\\nAlthough Fred Trump was born in New Jersey, family members say he felt compelled to hide his German background because most of his tenants were Jewish. \"After the war, he thought that Jews would never rent from him if they knew his lineage,\" Ivana reportedly said. Certainly, Fred Trump\\'s camouflage could easily convey to a child the impression that in business anything goes. When I asked Donald Trump about this, he was evasive: \"Actually, it was very difficult. My father was not German; my father\\'s parents were German. . .Swedish, and really sort of all over Europe. . . and I was even thinking in the second edition of putting more emphasis on other places because I was getting so many letters from Sweden: Would I come over and speak to Parliament? Would I come meet with the president?\"\\nDonald Trump appears to take aspects of his German background seriously. John Walter works for the Trump Organization, and when he visits Donald in his office, Ivana told a friend, he clicks his heels and says, \"Heil Hitler,\" possibly as a family joke.\\nLast April, perhaps in a surge of Czech nationalism, Ivana Trump told her lawyer Michael Kennedy that from time to time her husband reads a book of Hitler\\'s collected speeches, My New Order, which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed. Kennedy now guards a copy of My New Order in a closet at his office, as if it were a grenade. Hitler\\'s speeches, from his earliest days up through the Phony War of 1939, reveal his extraordinary ability as a master propagandist.\\n\"Did your cousin John give you the Hitler speeches?\" I asked Trump.\\nTrump hesitated. \"Who told you that?\"\\n\"I don\\'t remember,\" I said.\\n\"Actually, it was my friend Marty Davis from Paramount who gave me a copy of Mein Kampf, and he\\'s a Jew.\" (\"I did give him a book about Hitler,\" Marty Davis said. \"But it was My New Order, Hitler\\'s speeches, not Mein Kampf. I thought he would find it interesting. I am his friend, but I\\'m not Jewish.\")\\nLater, Trump returned to this subject. \"If I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them.\"\\nIs Ivana trying to convince her friends and lawyer that Trump is a crypto-Nazi? Trump is no reader or history buff. Perhaps his possession of Hitler\\'s speeches merely indicates an interest in Hitler\\'s genius at propaganda. The Führer often described his defeats at Stalingrad and in North Africa as great victories. Trump continues to endow his diminishing world with significance as well. \"There\\'s nobody that has the cash flow that I have,\" he told The Wall Street Journal long after he knew better. \"I want to be king of cash.\"\\nFred Trump, like his son, has never resisted exaggeration. When Donald was a child, his father bought a house that \"had nine bathrooms and columns like Tara,\" Fred Trump said. The house, however, was in Queens. Donald would someday envision a larger world. It was Donald\\'s mother, Mary, who revered luxury. \"My mother had a sense of the grand,\" Trump told me. \"I can remember her watching the coronation of Queen Elizabeth and being so fascinated by it. My father had no interest in that kind of thing at all.\"\\nDonald Trump often went with his father to construction sites, for they were extraordinarily close, almost kindred spirits. In family photographs, Fred and Donald stand together, often arm in arm, while Donald\\'s sisters and younger brother, Robert, seem off in the ether. Ivana has told friends that Donald even persuaded his father to put him in charge of his three siblings\\' trust funds.\\nDonald was one of five children, the second son. As a child, he was so boisterous that his parents sent him away to military school. \"That was the way it worked in the Trump family,\" a longtime friend told me. \"It was not a loving atmosphere.\" Donald was chubby then, but military school slimmed him down. He became forceful, and grew even closer to his father. \"I had to fight back all the time,\" Trump once told me. \"These guys like my father are tough. You have to be hitting back! Otherwise they don\\'t respect you!\"\\nFamily members say that the firstborn son, Fred junior, often felt shut out by the relationship between Donald and his father. As a young man, he announced his intention to be an airplane pilot. Later, according to a friend of Ivana\\'s, Donald and his father often belittled Fred junior for this career choice. \"Donald would say, \\'What is the difference between what you do and driving a bus? Why aren\\'t you in the family real-estate business?\\' \" Fred junior became an alcoholic and died at age forty-three. Ivana has always told her close friends that she believed the pressure put on him by his father and his brother hastened his early death. \"Perhaps unknowingly [we did put pressure on him],\" Trump told me. \"We assumed that [real estate] came rather easy to us and it should have come easily to him. I had success, and that put pressure on Fred too. What is this, a psychoanalysis of Donald?\"\\nDonald\\'s relationship with Robert has also had troubled moments. Robert, who did go into the family business, has always been \"the nice guy,\" in his brother\\'s shadow. There has been additional friction between Robert\\'s wife, Blaine, and Ivana. Blaine is considered a workhorse for New York charities, and Robert and Blaine are extremely popular—\"the good Trumps,\" they are called. \"Robert and I feel that if we say anything about the family, then we become public people,\" Blaine told me. The brothers\\' suppressed hostility erupted after the opening of the Taj Mahal. \"Robert told Donald that if he didn\\'t give him autonomy he would leave,\" Ivana told a friend. \"So Donald did leave him alone, and there was a mess with the slot machines which cost Donald $3 million to $10 million in the first three days. When Donald exploded, Robert packed his boxes and left. He and Blaine went to her family for Easter.\"\\nAs his father had had Bunny Lindenbaum for his fixer, Donald Trump had Roy Cohn, the Picasso of the inside fix. \"Cohn taught Donald which fork to use,\" a friend told me. \"I\\'ll bring my lawyer Roy Cohn with me,\" Trump often told city officials a decade ago, before he learned better. \"Donald calls me fifteen to twenty times a day,\" Cohn once told me. \"He has a maddening attention to detail. He is always asking, \\'What is the status of this? What is the status of that?\\' \"\\nIn a Trump tax-abatement case, according to Cohn\\'s biographer Nicholas von Hoffman, the judge was handed a piece of paper that looked like an affidavit. It had just one sentence on it: \"No further delays or adjournments. Stanley M. Friedman.\" By then Friedman had become the county leader of the Bronx. It wasn\\'t necessary to exchange money for such favors. This was a classic \"marker\"; the power of suggestion of future favors was enough.\\nFriedman had also been crucial to Trump\\'s plans for the Commodore Hotel. \"In the final days of the Beame administration,\" according to Wayne Barrett, \"Friedman rushed a $160 million, forty-year tax abatement... and actually executed the documents for the lame duck Beame.\" Friedman had already agreed to join Cohn\\'s law firm, which was representing Trump. \"Trump lost his moral compass when he made an alliance with Roy Cohn,\" Liz Smith once remarked.\\nIn New York, Trump soon became known for his confrontational style. He also became the largest contributor to Governor Hugh Carey of New York, except for Carey\\'s brother. Trump and his father gave $135,000. He was moving quickly now; he had set himself up in a Fifth Avenue office and a Fifth Avenue apartment and had hired Louise Sunshine, Carey\\'s chief of fund-raising, as his \"director of special projects.\" \"I knew Donald better than anyone,\" she told me. \"We\\'re a team, Sunshine and Trump, and when people shove us, we shove harder.\" Sunshine had raised millions of dollars for Carey, and she had one of the greatest address books in the city. She took Donald to meet every city and state power broker and worked on the sale of the Trump Tower apartments.\\nReal-estate tax is immensely complicated. Often profit-and-loss accounting does not run parallel with cash flow. Sometimes a developer can have tremendous cash flow and yet not report taxable earnings; tax laws also permit developers to have less cash flow and greater taxable earnings. It is up to the developer. When Donald Trump broke ground on a new apartment building at Sixty-first Street and Third Avenue, Louise Sunshine was given a 5 percent share of the new Trump Plaza, as it was called.\\nThere was some friction in Sunshine\\'s relationship with her boss. As a result of Trump\\'s accounting on Trump Plaza, Louise Sunshine, according to a close friend, would have had to pay taxes of $1 million. \"Why are you structuring Trump Plaza this way?\" she reportedly asked Donald. \"Where am I going to get $1 million?\" \"Sell me back your 5 percent share of Trump Plaza and you can have it,\" Trump said.\\nSunshine was so stunned by this that she went to her friend billionaire Leonard Stern for help. \"I wrote out a check for $1 million on the spot so that my close friend would not find herself squeezed out by Donald,\" Stern told me. \"I said to Louise, \\'You tell Trump that unless he treats you fairly you will litigate! And as a result, the details of his duplicitous treatment would not only come to the attention of the public but also to the Casino Control Commission.\\' \" Louise Sunshine hired Arthur Liman, who would later represent the financier Michael Milken, to handle her case. Liman worked out a settlement: Trump paid Louise Sunshine $2.7 million for her share of Trump Plaza. Sunshine repaid Leonard Stem. For several years, Trump and Sunshine had a cool relationship. But in fine New York style, they are now friends again. \"Donald never should have used his money as a power tool over me,\" Sunshine told me, adding, \"I have absolved him.\"\\nLike Michael Milken, Trump began to believe that his inordinate skills could be translated into any business. He started to expand out of the familiar world of real estate into casinos, airlines, and hotels. With Citicorp as his enabler, he bought the Plaza and the Eastern shuttle. He managed them both surprisingly well, but he had paid too much for them. He always had the ready cooperation of the starstruck banks, which would later panic. A member of the board of the Chase Manhattan Bank recently demanded at a meeting, \"What in God\\'s name were you thinking of to make these loans?\" No satisfactory answer was forthcoming; the Rockefeller bank had once kept Brazil afloat, too. The bankers, like the Brooklyn-machine hacks from Trump\\'s childhood, were blame shufflers, frantic to keep the game going.\\n\"You cannot believe the money the banks were throwing at us,\" a former top legal associate of Trump\\'s told me. \"For every deal we did, we would have six or eight banks who were willing to give us hundreds of millions of dollars. We used to have to pick through the financings; the banks could not sign on fast enough to anything Donald conceived.\"\\n\"He bought more and more properties and expanded so much that he guaranteed his own self-destruction. His fix was spending money. Well, his quick fix became his Achilles\\' heel,\" a prominent developer told me.\\nTrump\\'s negotiations, according to one lawyer who worked on the acquisition of the Atlantic City casino of Resorts International, were always unusually unpleasant. After the success of The Art of the Deal, Trump\\'s lawyers began to talk about \"Donald\\'s ego\" as if it were a separate entity. \"Donald\\'s ego will never permit us to accept that point,\" one lawyer said over and over again during the negotiations. \"The key to Donald, like with any bully, is to tell him to go fuck himself,\" the lawyer told me. When Mortimer Zuckerman, the chairman and C.E.O. of Boston Properties, submitted a design that was chosen for the site of the Fifty-ninth Street coliseum, Trump became apoplectic. \"He called everyone, trying to get his deal killed. Of course, Mort\\'s partner was Salomon Brothers, so Trump got nowhere,\" a person close to Zuckerman remembered.\\nOne image of Ivana and Donald Trump sticks in my memory. Wintertime, three years ago. They were at the Wollman Rink. Donald had just fixed it up for the city. He had been crowing in the newspapers about what dummies Mayor Koch and the city had been, wasting years and money and coming up with nothing on the skating rink. Trump had taken over the job and done it well. If he grabbed more of the credit than he deserved, no one really held it against him; the rink was open at last and filled with happy skaters.\\nIvana was wearing a striking lynx coat which showed her blond hair to advantage. Their arms were around each other. They looked so very young and rich, living in the moment of their success. A polite crowd had gathered to congratulate them on the triumph of the rink. The people near Donald appeared to feel enlivened by his presence, as if he were a hero. His happiness seemed a reflection of the crowd\\'s adulation.\\nNext to me a man called out, \"Why don\\'t you negotiate the SALT talks for Reagan, Donald?\" Ivana beamed. The snow began falling very lightly; from the rink below you could hear \"The Skaters\\' Waltz.\"\\nSome months before the Trumps\\' separation, Donald and Ivana were due at a dinner party being given in their honor. The Trumps were late, and this was not a dinner to be taken lightly. The hosts had a family name that evoked the very history of New York, yet as if they had recognized another force coming up in the city, they were honoring Donald and Ivana Trump.\\nTrump entered the room first. \"I had to tape the Larry King show,\" he said. \"I\\'m on Larry King tonight.\" He seemed very restless. Trump paid little attention to his blonde companion, and no one in the room recognized Ivana until she began to speak. \"My God! What has she done to herself?\" one guest asked. Ivana\\'s Slavic cheeks were gone; her lips had been fluffed up into a pout. Her limbs had been resculpted, and her cleavage astonishingly enhanced. The guests were so confused by her looks that her presence created an odd mood.\\nAll through dinner Donald fidgeted. He looked at his watch. He mentioned repeatedly that he was at that moment on the Larry King show, as if he expected the guests to get up from their places. He had been belligerent to King that night, and he wanted the guests to see him, perhaps to confirm his powers. \"Do you mind if I sit back a little? Because your breath is very bad—it really is,\" he had told Larry King on national TV.\\n\"Come on, Arnold! Pose with me! Come on!\" Ivana Trump called out to the designer Arnold Scaasi on a warm night this past June. They were at the Waldorf-Astoria, at an awards ceremony sponsored by the Fragrance Foundation, and Ivana was a presenter. The carpet was shabby in the Jade Room; the paparazzi were waiting to pounce. P.R. materials covered the tables of this \"must do\" event, of the kind that often passes for New York social life. The most expensive couture dress looked, under the blue-green tint of the lights, cheap.\\nI was surprised that she appeared. The day before, her husband\\'s crisis with the banks had provided the headlines on all three of the local tabloids, TRUMP IN A SLUMP! cried the Daily News. One columnist even said Trump\\'s problems were the occasion for city joy, and proposed a unity day. \"Ivana! Ivana! Ivana!\" the photographers called out to her. Ivana smiled, as if she were a presidential candidate. She wore a full-skirted mint-green satin beaded gown; her hair was swept off her face in a chignon. However humiliated for her children\\'s sake she may have felt by the bad publicity, she had elected to leave them at home that night. Ivana was at the Waldorf by 6:15 P.M., greeting reporters and paparazzi by name. She could not afford now to alienate the perfume establishment by canceling, for soon she would be merchandising a fragrance, and she would need their goodwill.\\nIvana seemed determined to keep her new stature in the city of alliances, for her financial future depended on her being able to salvage the brand name. As a woman alone, with a reduced fortune, Ivana was entering a tough world. She had no Rothkos to hock and no important jewels. But she did have the name Ivana, and she was making plans to market scarves, perfumes, handbags, and shoes, as once her husband had been able to market the name Trump.\\nSeveral feet away from us, the local CBS reporter was doing a stand-up for the evening news. The reporter was commenting on the unraveling of the Trump empire while Ivana was chatting with Scaasi and Estée Lauder. Lauder, a tough businesswoman herself, had reportedly told Ivana several months earlier, \"Go back with Donald. It is a cold world out here.\" I was reminded of a crowd scene in Nathanael West\\'s Day of the Locust. Ivana even allowed the CBS reporter to shove a microphone into her face. \"Donald and I are partners in marriage and in business. I will stand beside him through thick or thin, for better or worse,\" she told the reporters with bizarre aplomb. Ivana had become, like Donald, a double agent, able to project innocence and utter confidence. She had, in fact, almost turned into Donald Trump.\\n\"To tell you the truth, I\\'ve made Ivana a very popular woman. I\\'ve made a lot of satellites. Hey, whether it\\'s Marla or Ivana. Marla can do any movie she wants to now. Ivana can do whatever she wants,\" Donald Trump told me on the phone.\\n\"New York City is a very tough place,\" Ivana Trump told me years ago. \"I\\'m tough, too. When people give me a punch in the nose, I react by getting even tougher.\" We were walking through the rubble of the Commodore Hotel, which would soon reopen as the Grand Hyatt. Ivana had been given the responsibility of supervising all the decoration; she was hard at it, despite the fact that she was wearing a white wool Thierry Mugler jumpsuit and pale Dior shoes as she picked her way through the sawdust. \"I told you never to leave a broom like this in a room!\" she screamed at one worker. Screaming at her employees had become part of her hallmark, perhaps her way of feeling power. Later, in Atlantic City, she would become known for her obsession with cleanliness.\\nThe phrase \"Stockholm syndrome\" is now used by Ivana\\'s lawyer Michael Kennedy to describe her relationship with Donald. \"She had the mentality of a captive,\" Kennedy told me. \"After a while she couldn\\'t fight her captor anymore, and she began to identify with him. Ivana is deaf, dumb, and blind when it comes to Donald.\" If Donald worked eighteen-hour days, so would Ivana. The Trumps hired two nannies and a bodyguard for their children. She went to work running Trump Castle casino in Atlantic City, often spending two or three days a week there supervising the staff.\\nDetermined to bring glamour to Trump Castle, she became famous for her attention to appearances, once moving a pregnant waitress, desperate for big tips, off the casino floor. The woman was placed in a distant lounge and given a clown\\'s suit to disguise her condition.\\nIn New York, Ivana did not resist her husband\\'s grandiosity. Soon after Trump Tower was completed, the Trumps took possession of their triplex. Ivana\\'s lawyers often talk about her love of the domestic arts and describe her homemade jams and jellies. Yet the kitchen of her city apartment, which she designed, is tiny, no more than a kitchenette, tiled with gold linoleum. \"The children\\'s wing has a kitchen, and that is where the nanny cooks,\" a friend said. The Trump living room has a beige onyx floor with holes carved out to fit the carpets. There is a waterfall cascading down a marble wall, an Italianate fountain, and the famous murals. Their bedroom had a glass wall filled with arrangements of silk flowers. After a time, Ivana tired of the decor. She called in a renowned decorator. \"What can I do with this interior?\" she reportedly asked him. \"Absolutely nothing,\" he said.\\nChristmas Eve, three years ago. Ivana had received another stack of legal documents the size of a telephone book. \"What is this?\" she is said to have asked Donald. \"It is our new nuptial agreement. You get $10 million. Sign it!\" \"But I can\\'t look at this now, it\\'s Christmas,\" Ivana said. Donald pressed her, according to Kennedy. Trump seemed extraordinarily concerned that she sign the papers, perhaps because an Atlantic City photographer was threatening to blackmail him with photos he had taken of him and Marla Maples. However efficiently Ivana ran Trump Castle, she seemed terrified of her husband. She signed the papers giving her $10 million and the mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut. Later, Trump would tell reporters, \"Ivana has $25 million.\"\\nThe tactics he used in business he now brought home. \"Donald began calling Ivana and screaming all the time: \\'You don\\'t know what you are doing!\\' \\'\\' one of Ivana\\'s top assistants told me. \"When Ivana would hang up the phone, I would say, \\'How can you put up with this?\\' and Ivana would say, \\'Because Donald is right.\\' \\'\\' He began belittling her: \"That dress is terrible.\" \"You\\'re showing too much cleavage.\" \"You never spend enough time with the children.\" \"Who would touch those plastic breasts?\" Ivana told her friends that Donald had stopped sleeping with her. She blamed herself. \"I think it was Donald\\'s master plan to get rid of Ivana in Atlantic City, \" one of her assistants told me. \"By then, Marla Maples was in a suite at the Trump Regency. Atlantic City was to be their playground.\"\\nIvana had once warned her husband against Atlantic City. \"Why expand somewhere where there is no airport?\" Trump, however, was determined to invest there, even though Las Vegas associates had told him that Nevada gaming had profit factors that could total $200 million a year. But by now Marla Maples was in Atlantic City, and it was close to New York. Trump had become, according to one friend, \"so focused on Marla he wasn\\'t paying attention to his business.\"\\nThough Ivana had established herself in Atlantic City to please Donald, her presence there now, with Marla on the scene, was an inconvenience to him. With the acquisition of the Plaza hotel, he could deliver an ultimatum: \"Either you act like my wife and come back to New York and take care of your children or you run the casino in Atlantic City and we get divorced.\"\\n\"What am I going to do?\" she asked one of her assistants. \"If I don\\'t do what he says, I am going to lose him.\"\\nTrump even called a press conference to announce Ivana\\'s new position as the president of the Plaza hotel: \"My wife, Ivana, is a brilliant manager. I will pay her one dollar a year and all the dresses she can buy!\" Ivana called her friends in tears. \"How can Donald humiliate me this way?\"\\n\"I think Marla is very different from her image,\" Donald Trump told me in July. \"Her image is that of a very good-looking buxom blonde.\" A Donna Rice? \"She\\'s much different than that. She\\'s smart, she\\'s very nice, and not ambitious. She could have made a fortune in the last six months if she had wanted to!\"\\n\"How could you have allowed Marla to be the No Excuses jeans girl?\" I asked Trump. \"Because I figured she could make $600,000 for doing one day\\'s work. For the negative publicity, I thought, that $600,000 she can live on the rest of her life,\" Trump told me.\\nThis past February, Trump took off for Japan, telling reporters he would be attending the Mike Tyson fight. His real motive was reportedly to meet with bankers to try to sell the Plaza, for Arthur Andersen\\'s November audit had been dire. As he was flying back, he was radioed on the plane. Liz Smith had broken the story of the Trumps\\' separation. The entire sordid history of Marla Maples and Ivana fighting on the Aspen ski slopes was all over the papers. Ivana had done to Donald what years ago he had done to Jay Pritzker in Nepal. From the airplane, Trump called Liz Smith. \"Congratulations on your story,\" he told her sarcastically. \"I have had it with Ivana. She\\'s gotten to be like Leona Helmsley.\" \"Shame on you, Donald!\" Smith replied. \"How dare you say that about the mother of your children?\" \"Just write that someone from Howard Rubenstein\\'s office said it,\" Trump told Smith, referring to his well-connected press agent. (\"I never said that,\" Trump told me. \"Yes, he did,\" said Smith.) The Japanese bankers with whom Trump had negotiated a tentative sale suddenly backed off. \"The Japanese despise scandal,\" one of their associates told me.\\nSeveral weeks later, Donald called Ivana. \"Why don\\'t we walk down Fifth Avenue together for the photographers and pretend that this entire scandal has been a publicity stunt? We could say that we wanted to see who would side with you and who would side with me.\" As the press became more sympathetic to Ivana, Donald would scream at his lawyers, \"This is bullshit!\"\\nIvana began to repair old feuds all over town. \"We can be friends now, Leonard, can\\'t we?\" she said at a recent party, according to a friend of Leonard Stern\\'s. \"Your problem was with Donald, never me. I always liked you.\"\\nTrump\\'s lawyers tried mightily to catch up with Ivana. \"Donald saw a bill this week that Ivana charged $7,000 worth of Pratesi sheets for their daughter, Ivancka,\" one lawyer said. \"He called in a rage. \\'Why does a seven-year-old need $7,000 worth of sheets?\\' She charged a $350 shirt at Montenapoleone. Who was that for, her new best friend, Jerry Zipkin?\" The lawyer described Ivana\\'s bills from Carolina Herrera: \"We will get a bill for $25,000, and Ivana will have photocopied over the invoice, so instead of one dress at $25,000, in her own handwriting she will write, \\'Six items for $25,000.\\' \" (A spokesman for Ivana says that this is completely untrue.)\\nThe scandal was seriously affecting the Trump children. Donny junior was being ridiculed at the Buckley School. Ivancka had been in tears at Chapin. When Donald and Marla Maples attended the same Elton John concert, Donny junior cried, for his father had told the children he would give Marla Maples up. \"The children are all wrecks,\" Ivana told Liz Smith. \"I don\\'t know how Donald can say they are great and fine. Ivancka now comes home from school crying, \\'Mommy, does it mean I\\'m not going to be Ivancka Trump anymore?\\' Little Eric asks me, \\'Is it true you are going away and not coming back?\\' \" However cavalier Ivana\\'s public behavior was, in private she often cried. Once her husband\\'s co-conspirator, she told friends that she now felt she was his victim.\\nOn the Saturday of Donald Trump\\'s forty-fourth-birthday celebration, I tried to take a walk on the West Side yards above Lincoln Center in Manhattan. The railroad tracks were rusty, the land was overgrown. The property stretched on, block after block. It was cool by the Hudson River that morning, with a pleasant breeze whipping over the water. The only sign of Trump was a high storm fence topped with elaborate curls of barbed wire to keep out the homeless people who live nearby. It was on this land, at the height of his megalomania, that Trump said he would erect \"the tallest building in the world,\" a plan which was successfully thwarted by neighborhood activists who were resistant to having parts of the West Side obscured in shadow. \"They have no power,\" Trump said at the time, baffled that anyone would resist his grandiose schemes.\\nIvana had left for London to take part in one more public-relations event promoting the Plaza, only this time her friends the Baron and Baroness Ricky di Portanova were rumored to be paying the bill. Ivana had had her New York media campaign orchestrated by John Scanlon, who had handled public relations for CBS during the Westmoreland libel case. In London, she was cosseted by Eleanor Lambert, the doyenne of fashion publicists. A story went around London that she couldn\\'t afford her hotel and had moved in with a friend on Eaton Square. She was treading the same ground as Undine Spragg, who so carefully calculated her rise in Edith Wharton\\'s The Custom of the Country. Sir Humphry Wakefield assembled a list of titled guests for a dinner, but there was friction between him and Ivana. When the guests, including the Duchess of Northumberland, arrived, many of them were displeased that they had been lured to a dinner which, to their surprise, was in honor of Ivana Trump. \"Humphry will pay for this,\" one guest reportedly said.\\nThat Saturday, New York seemed oddly vacant without the Trumps. Donald had left for his birthday party in Atlantic City. Hundreds of casino employees had been told to be on the Boardwalk to greet him, since Manhattan boosters were in short supply. The day before, he had defaulted on $73 million owed to bondholders and bankers. Clowns and jesters borrowed from Trump\\'s Xanadu attempted to entertain the waiting employees and reporters underneath Trump\\'s minarets and elephants, which soon might be repossessed.\\nTrump arrived very late, flanked by his bodyguards. His face was hard, his mouth set into a line. With an elaborate flourish, Trump\\'s executives pulled a curtain to reveal his birthday tribute, a huge portrait of Donald Trump, the same image the Japanese stared at in his Manhattan tower. The size of the portrait was unsettling on the Atlantic City Boardwalk: ten feet of the Donald, leaning forward on his elbow, his face frozen in the familiar defiant smirk.\\nWithin days, the bankers agreed to give Trump $65 million to pay his bills. Much of his empire would probably have to be dismantled, but he would retain control. His personal allowance would now be $450,000 a month. \"I can live with that,\" Trump said. \\'\\'However absurd this sounds, it was smarter to do it this way than to let a judge preside over a fire sale in a bankruptcy court,\" one banker told me. Trump crowed about the bailout. \"This is a great victory. It\\'s a great agreement for everybody,\" he said.\\nNot exactly. Trump\\'s bankers were said to be so upset at Trump\\'s balance sheet— he was reportedly over half a billion dollars in the hole—that they demanded he sign over his future trust inheritance to secure the new loans. Trump\\'s father, who had created him by helping him achieve his first deals, now seemed to be rescuing him again. \"Total bullshit,\" Trump told me. \"I have been given five years by the banks. The banks would never have asked me for my future inheritance, and I would never have given it.\"\\nSoon after, Trump announced that the French department store Galeries Lafayette would take over the vast space Bonwit Teller had vacated in Trump Tower. \"This is in no way a comeback,\" Trump told me. \"Because I never went anywhere.\"\\nI was still searching for Donald Trump. On a rainy Thursday in July, I went down to federal court, where he was set to testify in a civil case in which he was a defendant. Along with his contractor, Trump had been accused of hiring scores of illegal Polish aliens to do the demolition work on the Trump Tower site. \"The Polish brigade,\" as they came to be called, had been astonishingly exploited on the job, earning four dollars an hour for work that usually paid five times that.\\nThe last time I had been in this neighborhood was to hear the verdict in the John Gotti trial. I had come to know the area well. The guard inside greeted me by name. I was often here dipping in and out of the courtrooms to observe the notorious figures of the last decade. I thought of Bess Myerson, Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky, Leona Helmsley, Imelda Marcos, and Adnan Khashoggi, shattered and brought down in the crazy kaleidoscope of the 1980s. Each one had, at one time in his or her life, been thought to be like Donald Trump, a figure of greatness, anointed with special powers. In front of the courthouse, the police barricades were up. So many celebrities passed through these revolving doors that the yellow sawhorses were left routinely on the massive courthouse steps.\\nI thought about the ten years since I had first met Donald Trump. It is fashionable now to say that he was a symbol of the crassness of the 1980s, but Trump became more than a vulgarian. Like Michael Milken, Trump appeared to believe that his money gave him a freedom to set the rules. No one stopped him. His exaggerations and baloney were reported, and people laughed. His bankers showered him with money. City officials almost allowed him to set public policy by erecting his wall of concrete on the Hudson River. New York City, like the bankers from the Chase and Manny Hanny, allowed Trump to exist in a universe where all reality had vanished. \"I met with a couple of reporters,\" Trump told me on the telephone, \"and they totally saw what I was saying. They completely believed me. And then they went out and wrote vicious things about me, as I am sure you will, too.\" Long ago, Trump had counted me among his enemies in his world of \"positives\" and \"negatives.\" I felt that the next dozen people he spoke to would probably be subjected to a catalogue of my transgressions as imagined by Donald Trump.\\nWhen I got to the courtroom, Trump had gone. His lawyer, the venerable and well-connected Milton Gould, was smiling broadly, for he appeared to believe that he was wiping the floor with this case. Trump had said that he knew nothing about the demolitions, that his contractor had been \"a disaster.\" Yet one F.B.I. informant testified that he had warned Trump of the presence of the Polish brigade and had told him that if he didn\\'t get rid of them his casino license might not be granted.\\nI wandered down to the pressroom on the fifth floor to hear about Trump\\'s testimony. The reporters sounded weary; they had heard it all before. \\'\\'Goddamn it,\" one shouted at me, \"we created him! We bought his bullshit! He was always a phony, and we filled our papers with him!\"\\nI thought about the last questions Donald Trump had asked me the day before on the telephone. \"How long is your article?\" \"Long,\" I said. Trump seemed pleased. \"Is it a cover?\" he asked.\\n \\n \\n \\n         2020 Time Capsule #3: ‘I Don’t Take Responsibility at All’        Jonathan Ernst / Reuters     Editor’s Note: This article previously appeared in a different format as part of\\xa0The Atlantic’s\\xa0Notes section, retired in 2021.    This afternoon, on the heels of a widely panned formal Oval Office address, Donald Trump assembled a group of scientific and corporate leaders to talk about dealing with the coronavirus. You can watch the whole thing on the White House YouTube channel. I suspect that we’ll see one line from this conference played frequently in the months ahead. You can watch it starting at around 1:22:00, when reporter Kristen Welker of NBC asks Trump whether he takes responsibility for the lag in making test kits available. Trump’s reply:   No. I don’t take responsibility at all.   Narrowly parsed, and in full context, Trump was referring only to the test kits — and was continuing his (fantasized) complaint that rules left over from 2016, under the Obama administration, are the real reason the U.S. has been so slow to respond to this pandemic. But filmable moments in politics are not always taken in full context, and at their most narrowly parsed logical reading: All of these—in full context, and most-sympathetically read—had a meaning you could understand and perhaps defend. None of that context or meaning survived, as those went from being phrases to weaponized symbols. Will that happen to “I don’t take responsibility at all”? We will soon see.  Other stage business points:   A series of CEOs came to the microphone to describe what their companies were doing to speed testing or help out in other ways. Trump caught the first three or four of them unawares, by shaking their hands as they moved away from the lectern. All seemed startled, as you can see in the video. Then the other CEOs began to catch on, and a following group of them scuttled away from the microphone before Trump could grab them for a handshake, or held their own hands clenched together, in a protective prayer-style grasp.  Finally, (at 1:06 in the video) you can see Bruce Greenstein, of the LHC group, surprise Trump with an elbow-bump rather than a hand shake. Trump himself seemed completely oblivious to the idea of social distancing. It was also notable that one speaker after another touched and moved around the same microphone, and put his her hands on the sides of the same lectern.  I mentioned earlier today the uneasy and evolving position of Anthony Fauci, who has been the “voice of science” through this episode as he has during previous medical emergencies. The uneasiness lies in the tension between his decades as a respected scientist, and his current role as a prominent member of Team Trump. Can he retain his long reputation as a straight shooter? While maintaining any influence with Trump? Make what you will of his body language through the events today. (He is at far left in the picture below.)    White House   Also today, I mentioned the inevitable-for-Trump, though inconceivable-in-other-administrations, ritual of Trump subordinates limitlessly praising the goodness and wisdom of their leader. It was striking to see all the CEOs skipping right past that formality. But if you felt a phantom-limb twinge in the absence of these comments, all you had to do was wait for Mike Pence. You can hear him starting at around 1:07, with comments that began “This day should be an inspiration to every American” and built in earnestness from there.    There was much more from the question-and-answer session, but I don’t want to spoil the experience of discovery for anyone who has not seen it yet. Two hundred and thirty-five days until the election.    He fingered the microphone and put his lips up close. He shook hands with everyone he could. Donald Trump, who promised you’re going to win so much you’ll get sick of winning, might also just make you sick.  In the White House rose garden on Friday, the US president defied the advice of medical experts standing behind him and behaved like a one-man coronavirus cannon.  Trump declared a national emergency (“two very big words”, said the man known for his misspelled tweets) that would release up to $50bn to combat the pandemic, which this week topped 2,000 cases and had the lamps going out all over America. Reporters wanted to know whether this 73-year-old man with a poor diet – his former doctor reportedly hid cauliflower in his mashed potatoes – is putting himself and others at risk. Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro’s press secretary tested positive for coronavirus days after taking part in meetings with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.   Should Trump therefore self-isolate? “Well, I don’t know that I had exposure, but I don’t have any of the symptoms,” he replied. “And we do have a White House doctor and, I should say, many White House doctors, frankly. And I asked them that same question, and they said, ‘You don’t have any symptoms whatsoever.’ And we don’t want people without symptoms to go and do the test. The test is not insignificant.” But later another reporter pushed him harder, noting that a person without symptoms might still be infected. Question: “Are you being selfish by not getting tested and potentially exposing – ” Trump: “Well, I didn’t say I wasn’t going to be tested.” Question: “Are you going to be?” Trump: “Most likely, yeah. Most likely.” Question: “When do you think that will happen?” Trump: “Not for that reason, but because I think I will do it anyway. Fairly soon.” Coronavirus is a crisis of a different magnitude from those faced by Trump before. It has upended daily life and left liberals cursing the cosmic dice: how come Tom Hanks is infected while Trump gets off scot-free? When the celebrity businessman has his back to the wall, he calls for the cavalry of corporate America. At Friday’s press conference he rolled in business titans to save the day, treating them to plenty of handshakes and little social distancing. “You’re going to be hearing from some of the largest companies and greatest retailers and medical companies in the world,” he said, presumably hoping to reassure the stock market. “They’re standing right behind me and to the side of me ... they’re celebrities in their own right.” Trump announced that “drive-thru” testing centers would be set up in parking lots at CVS, Target, Walmart and Walgreens stores. This, he hopes, will resolve a spectacularly awful time lag in testing kits being made available. America has been put to shame by South Korea. The wartime president Harry Truman used to keep a sign on his desk that said: “The buck stops here.” Trump, however, seems eager to wash his hands of the matter, if not actually wash his hands. “Yeah, no, I don’t take responsibility at all, because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time,” he said. “It wasn’t meant for this kind of an event with the kind of numbers that we’re talking about.” Then Yamiche Alcindor of PBS asked why, in 2018, Trump had dissolved the White House’s National Security Council directorate for global health security and biodefense. Like a schoolboy caught red-handed, he blustered: “Well, I just think it’s a nasty question because what we’ve done is – and Tony has said numerous times that we’ve saved thousands of lives because of the quick closing. And when you say ‘me’, I didn’t do it. We have a group of people I could – ”  Alcindor followed up. Trump rambled: “It’s the – it’s the administration. Perhaps they do that. You know, people let people go. You used to be with a different newspaper than you are now. You know, things like that happen.” It is not the first time he has resorted to the word “nasty” when asked a tough question by a woman of colour. The buck stops here.  \\n\\t\\n\\tThis is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.\\n\\t\\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Public health and national security experts shake their heads when President Donald Trump says the coronavirus “came out of nowhere” and “blindsided the world.”\\nThey’ve been warning about the next pandemic for years and criticized the Trump administration’s decision in 2018 to dismantle a National Security Council directorate at the White House charged with preparing for when, not if, another pandemic would hit the nation.\\n“It would be nice if the office was still there,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Health, told Congress this week. “I wouldn’t necessarily characterize it as a mistake (to eliminate the unit). I would say we worked very well with that office.”\\nThe NSC directorate for global health and security and bio-defense survived the transition from President Barack Obama to Trump in 2017.\\nTrump’s elimination of the office suggested, along with his proposed budget cuts for the CDC, that he did not see the threat of pandemics in the same way that many experts in the field did.\\n“One year later I was mystified when the White House dissolved the office, leaving the country less prepared for pandemics like COVID-19,” Beth Cameron, the first director of the unit, wrote in an op-ed Friday in The Washington Post.\\nShe said the directorate was set up to be the “smoke alarm” and get ahead of emergencies and sound a warning at the earliest sign of fire — “all with the goal of avoiding a six-alarm fire.”\\nIt’s impossible to assess the impact of the 2018 decision to disband the unit, she said. Cameron noted that biological experts remain at the White House, but she says it’s clear that eliminating the office contributed to what she called a “sluggish domestic response.” She said that shortly before Trump took office, the unit was watching a rising number of cases in China of a deadly strain of the flu and a yellow fever outbreak in Angola.\\n“It’s unclear whether the decision to disband the directorate, which was made in May 2018, after John Bolton became national security adviser, was a tactical move to downgrade the issue or whether it was part of the White House’s interest in simplifying and shrinking the National Security Council staff,” Cameron says.\\nThe NSC during the Obama administration grew to about 250 professionals, according to Trump’s current national security adviser, Robert O’Brien. The staff has been cut to about 110 or 115 staffers, he said.\\nWhen Trump was asked on Friday whether closing the NSC global health unit slowed the U.S. response, the president called it a “nasty” question because his administration had acted quickly and saved lives.\\n“I don’t know anything about it,” Trump said.\\nEarlier, when asked about it, he said: “This is something that you can never really think is going to happen.”\\nOn Saturday, John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser, dismissed claims that “streamlining NSC structures impaired our nation’s bio defense are false.” In a tweet, he said global health “remained a top NSC priority, and its expert team was critical to effectively handling the 2018-19 Africa Ebola crisis. The angry Left just can’t stop attacking, even in a crisis.”\\nFor many years, the national intelligence director’s worldwide threat assessment has warned that a flu pandemic or other large-scale outbreak of a contagious disease could lead to massive rates of death and disability that would severely affect the world economy. Public health experts have been blowing whistles too.\\nBack in mid-2018, Fauci told Congress: “When you have a respiratory virus that can be spread by droplets and aerosol and … there’s a degree of morbidity associated with that, you can have a catastrophe. … The one that we always talk about is the 1918 pandemic, which killed between 50 and 100 million people. … Influenza first, or something like influenza, is the one that keeps me up at night.”\\nThe White House says the NSC remains involved in responding to the coronavirus pandemic.\\nA senior administration official said Friday that the NSC’s global health security directorate was absorbed into another division where similar responsibilities still exist, but under different titles. The work of coordinating policy and making sure that decisions made by Trump’s coronavirus task force are implemented is still the job of the NSC.\\nSome lawmakers aren’t convinced.\\nRep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., and Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, have introduced a bill that would require future administrations to have experts always in place to prepare for new pandemics.\\n“Two years ago, the administration dismantled the apparatus that had been put in place five years before in the face of the Ebola crisis,” Connolly said. “I think, in retrospect, that was an unwise move. This bill would restore that and institutionalize it.”\\nConnolly said the bill is not meant to be critical of the Trump administration. He said it’s a recognition that Trump had to name a coronavirus responder just like Obama had to name one for Ebola in 2014. “We can’t go from pandemic to pandemic,” Connolly said.\\nThe House Foreign Affairs Committee on March 4 passed the measure, which is co-sponsored by 37 Democrats and five Republicans. The full House has not yet voted on the bill.\\nChabot said one of the bill’s main goals is to would require personnel to be permanently in place preparing for pandemics.\\n“Specifically, we need someone, preferable at the NSC, to quarterback the U.S. government’s response since that response inevitably involves several agencies across the government,” Chabot said. “Our bill would make this position permanent.”\\nFormer Obama administration officials insist that the Trump White House would have been able to act more quickly had the office still been intact.\\n“I think if we’d had a unit and dedicated professionals looking at this issue, gaming out scenarios well before … we might have identified some of these testing issues,” says Lisa Monaco, President Obama’s homeland security adviser, said at a recent forum on coronavirus. “There would have been folks sounding the alarm in December when we saw this coming out of China, saying ‘Hey, what do we need to be doing here in this country to address it?”\\nRon Klain, who managed the government response to contain and mitigate the spread of Ebola in 2014, agreed.\\n“If I were back in my old job at the White House … I’d be pushing to have us do 30 million tests — to test people in nursing homes, to test people with unexplained respiratory ailments, to test the people who regularly visit nursing homes, to test healthcare workers,” Klain said recently at the event hosted by the Center for American Progress in Washington.\\n\\t \\n\\n Donald Trump Tried to Convince German Scientists to Make Coronavirus Vaccine \\'Only for the United States\\': Report\\n  President Donald Trump has reportedly attempted to convince a German research firm working toward a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine to produce the life-saving treatment \"only for the United States.\"  Reuters reported on Sunday that German government sources said that the Trump administration was attempting to secure access to a potential vaccine under development by the firm CureVac. The news agency noted that the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag had previously reported that a German government source had said \"Trump was trying to secure the [CureVac] scientists\\' work exclusively, and would do anything to get a vaccine for the United States, \\'but only for the United States.\\'\" A White House source told Newsweek that the administration was not aware of the report or the underlying information. Newsweek has also reached out to the State Department for comment. CureVac said in a Sunday statement that it \"rejects current rumors of an acquisition.\"    \\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Donald Trump arrive for the group photo at the G-7 Summit on May 26, 2017 in Taormina, Italy\\nSean Gallup/Getty\\n  \\n But a spokesperson for Germany\\'s economy minister suggested the government could block an effort from the U.S. to take control of the company. The spokesperson told Reuters that the German government\\'s foreign trade law allows for scrutinizing foreign takeover bids \"if national or European security interests are at stake.\" A spokesperson for the German Health Ministry also told Reuters they could \"confirm\" the report by Welt am Sonntag.  Newsweek has reached out to the German Embassy in Washington, D.C. for further comment. Christof Hettich, the chief executive of dievini Hopp Bio Tech Holding, CureVac\\'s top investor, said an exclusive deal with the U.S. was not on the table. \"We want to develop a vaccine for the whole world and not individual countries,\" he said, according to German broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW). CureVac\\'s then-CEO Daniel Menichella attended a White House meeting with Trump and other administration officials about a possible vaccine earlier this month, DW reported. Menichella was replaced several days later as CEO by the company\\'s founder Ingmar Hoerr. CureVac did not give a reason for the change.    This is depraved. The German government confirms that Trump apparently tried to bribe German scientists into giving him exclusive rights to the Covid-19 vaccine they were working on developing. He wanted it “for the US only.” How many new lows will he set for the United States? https://twitter.com/amanbatheja/status/1239177184536862721 — Brian Klaas (@brianklaas) March 15, 2020  \\n Some analysts were quick to criticize the president over the report. \"This is depraved. The German government confirms that Trump apparently tried to bribe German scientists into giving him exclusive rights to the Covid-19 vaccine they were working on developing,\" Dr. Brian Klaas, a political scientist and lecturer at University College London tweeted. \"He wanted it \\'or the US only.\\' How many new lows will he set for the United States?\" Marcel Dirsus, a non-resident fellow at the Institute for Security Policy at Kiel University in Germany, also tweeted about the news, saying he was \"struggling to think of a better way to make yourself unpopular with allies during a pandemic.\" Dirsus noted that \"a lot of Germans are now going to talk about the need to \\'defend themselves\\' against America.\" \\n  \\n     A week exactly after his inauguration, seated for dinner at a small, oval table in the Green Room of the White House, Donald Trump said to the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation what might end up being the six most consequential words of his presidency.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI need loyalty, I expect loyalty.â\\x80\\x9d  All leaders want loyalty. All politicians. All presidents. But in the 241-year history of the United States of America, thereâ\\x80\\x99s never been a commander in chief who has thought about loyalty and attempted to use it and enforce it quite like Trump. â\\x80\\x9cI value loyalty above everything elseâ\\x80\\x94more than brains, more than drive and more than energy,â\\x80\\x9d Trump once said. It is possible to see Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s fixation on loyalty, the pledging of it, the proof of it, the failure to receive it or provide it, as the animating force behind so many of the defining events of his first year in office. Consider James Comeyâ\\x80\\x99s extraordinary dismissal; the â\\x80\\x9cDear Leaderâ\\x80\\x9d Cabinet meetings convened for aides to bestow slavish praise; public humiliations of his attorney general and secretary of state; the banishment and subsequent contrition of top adviser Steve Bannon; speculation that Robert Mueller wonâ\\x80\\x99t last long as special counsel and the parade of lockstep minions whose forced exits from the campaign or the administration have not squelched their public displays of devotion.\\nBy presidential standards, these episodes are bizarre. But in Trumpworld, they fit a distinct pattern. They all trace back to a notion of loyalty that Trump absorbed when he was youngâ\\x80\\x94and has never abandoned.\\nAccording to people who know him well, Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s definition of loyalty is blunt. â\\x80\\x9cSupport Donald Trump in anything he says and does,â\\x80\\x9d Roger Stone, the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s longest-running political adviser, told me. â\\x80\\x9cNo matter what,â\\x80\\x9d former Trump Organization executive Barbara Res said. â\\x80\\x9cOr else,â\\x80\\x9d added Louise Sunshine, a friend of Trump for nearly 50 years. â\\x80\\x9cI think he defines it as allegiance,â\\x80\\x9d biographer Tim Oâ\\x80\\x99Brien told me. â\\x80\\x9cAnd itâ\\x80\\x99s not allegiance to the flag or allegiance to the countryâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s allegiance to Trump.â\\x80\\x9d\\nCongenitally untrusting, reared in the ruthless arena of pay-to-play, back-scratching (and back-stabbing) New York City politics of the 1960s, â\\x80\\x9970s and â\\x80\\x9980s, Trump was schooled and shaped by some of the most committed, effective and objectionable practitioners of quid pro quo. The self-interested sense of loyalty he developed then is transactional to the point of ephemeral, an almost always one-way street that can double as a revolving doorâ\\x80\\x94a kind of pliability that makes him seem at times something close to forgiving.\\nTaken as a whole, this mixture of traits makes Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s unprecedented presidency unprecedented in this respect as well, presidential historians told me. Presidents all require loyaltyâ\\x80\\x94up to a point. And they have to show loyaltyâ\\x80\\x94except when they shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t. Too much loyalty can be just as detrimental to a president and his administration as too little. No president, in the historiansâ\\x80\\x99 estimation, has ever built an administration on a scaffolding that uses this quality almost to the exclusion of others, or has so deliberately announced that other virtues of managementâ\\x80\\x94the need for unvarnished counsel, even principled defianceâ\\x80\\x94will be punished. The consequences, they acknowledge, are impossible to predict in real time; there are simply too many personal and political variables. But past presidencies offer clear examples of the limits of loyalty. Abraham Lincoln, for instance, was consistently and uncommonly loyal, and so was George H.W. Bush; the former is considered one of the finest presidents ever, and the latter is â\\x80¦ not. Andrew Jackson and Richard Nixon, Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s two most frequently cited analogs from the past, both demanded loyalty in hugely personalized ways; it helped Jackson accomplish what he wanted to accomplish, and it led to Nixonâ\\x80\\x99s getting impeached. In the case of Trump, historians wonder most pointedly whether the particular type of loyalty he appears to crave is meant to serve the broader aims of his administration or simply to fan the flames of his insatiable ego.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI need loyalty,â\\x80\\x9d he said to Comey a second time near the end of their Green Room dinner. He has questioned the loyalty of his attorney general. He has asked his deputy attorney general if he was â\\x80\\x9con my team.â\\x80\\x9d He has asked Comeyâ\\x80\\x99s replacement how he voted.\\nHis whole life, the people loyal to Trump were the people who pleased him and praised him, who kowtowed to him, who fought for him and attacked others at his behest, who were willing to do whatever it took to get him whatever he wanted.\\nIt helped him become president. Now people wonder if it could be his fatal flaw. \\n***\\n Whether or not Comey knew it or meant it this way, he used, in his seven-page written description of his interactions with Trump, one unusual word that jumped off the page. Their dinner at the White House, Comey thought, was at least partly Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9ceffort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship.â\\x80\\x9d\\nPatronage is worthy of note, because Trump learned loyalty not from the Kew-Forest School in Queens or New York Military Academy 70 miles north of New York City. (â\\x80\\x9cDuty, honor, country,â\\x80\\x9d one of his classmates told me they learned in American history class.) Rather, Trump was tutored on this front by two peopleâ\\x80\\x94the two most important, most influential people in his life, according to everybody Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever talked to whoâ\\x80\\x99s ever known him well.\\nHis father. And Roy Cohn.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think Trump actually is loyal to a very wide range of people, and I suspect he learned it from his father,â\\x80\\x9d Newt Gingrich, the former House Speaker and a Trump ally and informal adviser, told me. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s father, Fred, had the same secretary, Amy Luerssen, for 59 years, eating lunch with her almost every weekday at Gargiuloâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94with waiters in tuxedosâ\\x80\\x94in Brooklyn, around the corner from Nathanâ\\x80\\x99s Famous hot dog stand, just up from the Coney Island boardwalk.\\nCohn, meanwhile, was the gay homophobe, the anti-Semitic Jew, the self-serving, self-loathing one-time chief counsel and henchman of red-baiting Senator Joe McCarthy of 1950s infamy. The son of a politically connected judge in the Bronx, Cohn cultivated powerful lifelong friends of his own. The lawyer also trafficked in tabloid gossip and leaked on clients and didnâ\\x80\\x99t pay his taxes or his bills. He wielded his dark power like a guillotine. â\\x80\\x9cRoyâ\\x80\\x99s concept of loyalty is not unlike that of a mob chieftain,â\\x80\\x9d Ken Auletta wrote in his seminal 1978 Esquire profile.  \\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s another way he defines loyalty, right? Itâ\\x80\\x99s allegiance plus thuggery.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhat Fred Trump and Roy Cohn had in common was their deep immersion in patronage politicsâ\\x80\\x94old-school, clubhouse-style favor-trading, used to grasp private gain under the guise of public good. â\\x80\\x9cYou take care of the boss and the boss takes care of you,â\\x80\\x9d as veteran New York political operative Hank Sheinkopf described it to me. Operating within the Democratic machines of Brooklyn and Queens, Fred Trump for decades made shrewd connections and large, dutiful donations in exchange for preference in properties, pricing and zoning. And Cohn? Cohn was a virtuoso in â\\x80\\x9cthe trade of human calculus,â\\x80\\x9d his biographer wrote, â\\x80\\x9cof deal making, swapping, maneuver, and manipulation.â\\x80\\x9d Watching and emulating these two, the canny younger Trump reportedly looked, too, to fabled Brooklyn boss Meade Esposito as a model. Esposito once was caught by an FBI wiretap saying there should have been an 11th Commandment: â\\x80\\x9cThink of Thyself.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThis was the context in which Donald Trump moved to Manhattan in the 1970s as an avaricious twentysomething. Abe Beame, the mayor at the time, was a way-back Fred Trump crony from Brooklyn. And now Fred Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s son was part of the deal. â\\x80\\x9cWhatever Donald and Fred want, they have my complete backing,â\\x80\\x9d Beame once said in his office, according to Wayne Barrettâ\\x80\\x99s book on Trump. And then it was Cohn who got Trump his tax breaks for Trump Tower. He greased skids and filed suits. â\\x80\\x9cDonald calls me 15 to 20 times a day,â\\x80\\x9d Cohn said in 1980 to reporter Marie Brenner. â\\x80\\x9cAll I can tell you is heâ\\x80\\x99s been vicious to others in protection of me,â\\x80\\x9d Trump told her. â\\x80\\x9cRoy was brutal,â\\x80\\x9d he would say later to Oâ\\x80\\x99Brien, the biographer, â\\x80\\x9cbut he was a very loyal guy. He brutalized for you.â\\x80\\x9d\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s precisely the reason Attorney General Jeff Sessionsâ\\x80\\x99 recusal from the Russia investigation in March so angered Trump. â\\x80\\x9cBecause he didnâ\\x80\\x99t brutalize,â\\x80\\x9d Oâ\\x80\\x99Brien told me. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s another way he defines loyalty, right? Itâ\\x80\\x99s allegiance plus thuggery.â\\x80\\x9d\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhereâ\\x80\\x99s my Roy Cohn?â\\x80\\x9d Trump raged to White House officials last year, according to the New York Times.\\nSince Cohnâ\\x80\\x99s death, in 1986, Trump as a businessman always has kept a small clutch of longtime loyalistsâ\\x80\\x94his executive assistant, Norma Foerderer, who died in 2013; his secretary, Rhona Graff, who still works at Trump Tower; Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organizationâ\\x80\\x99s chief financial officer; and Matt Calamari, his chief operating officer, who started as a bodyguard and chauffeur. â\\x80\\x9cI have stayed with the Trump Organization because Mr. Trump appreciates hard work and loyaltyâ\\x80\\x94and I would never want to disappoint him,â\\x80\\x9d Calamari told me in 2016.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99d do anything for me, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t you, Matty?â\\x80\\x9d Trump called out from the rear of his limousine one day in the fall of 1989, according to Harry Hurt IIIâ\\x80\\x99s Trump biography, Lost Tycoon. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s affair with Marla Maples would lead in a matter of months to the ultra-public blowup of the first of his three marriages. Due to mounting debt from his casinos, the Trump Shuttle airline and his rash purchase of the Plaza Hotel, Trump was headed toward potential financial ruin. But he wanted to demonstrate to an associate in the car the kind of loyalty he could command.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, Mr. Trump,â\\x80\\x9d Calamari answered.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnything at all?â\\x80\\x9d Trump asked.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, Mr. Trump.â\\x80\\x9d\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWould you kill for me, Matty?â\\x80\\x9d\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\nTrump repeated the question two more times, then smiled at the associate. â\\x80\\x9cSee,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cMatty would kill for me.â\\x80\\x9d\\nNot everybody was like Matty.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe did not like people who disagreed with him, and that was my fundamental problem,â\\x80\\x9d Bruce Nobles, the former Trump Shuttle president, told me. â\\x80\\x9cHe thinks heâ\\x80\\x99s a smart guy. I donâ\\x80\\x99t deny heâ\\x80\\x99s a smart guy. But he didnâ\\x80\\x99t know nearly as much about aviation as I didâ\\x80\\x94but he kept trying to tell me I was wrong about things. And instead of just agreeing with him, I said, â\\x80\\x98No, youâ\\x80\\x99re wrong.â\\x80\\x99 And that was not something he liked to hear. Those who disagree with him donâ\\x80\\x99t seem to last very long.â\\x80\\x9d\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe demanded loyalty in the sense that he didnâ\\x80\\x99t like a lot of pushback,â\\x80\\x9d ex-Trump casino executive Jack Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell said in an interview.\\nBut what he demanded he did not give back in the same measure.\\nSaid Nobles: â\\x80\\x9cI never particularly thought that he was loyal toâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94he paused to think before coming up emptyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9canybody.â\\x80\\x9d\\nSam Nunberg concurs. Nunberg worked for four years for Trump as a political consultant and campaign aide. He was fired in 2014 for facilitating a BuzzFeed profile Trump didnâ\\x80\\x99t like and again in 2015 because of some old racist Facebook posts. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll never forgive him for it, because I asked him not to fire me,â\\x80\\x9d Nunberg told me. â\\x80\\x9cI would have gone through fire for him. And he betrayed me.â\\x80\\x9d Nunberg called Trump a â\\x80\\x9cdumbfuckâ\\x80\\x9d for firing him.\\nBut perhaps the most interesting, illustrative people in the life of Trump are those who have moved in and out of his inner circleâ\\x80\\x94but never totally leave. People like Louise Sunshine and Roger Stone. Both of them have known Trump for the better part of the past half-century and still talk to him, and seem to understand, embrace and even take advantage of the characteristic vicissitudes of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s loyalty.  \\nPerhaps the most interesting, illustrative people in the life of Trump are those who have moved in and out of his inner circleâ\\x80\\x94but never totally leave.\\n\\nSunshine was Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s first employee, a politically savvy, wired aide who helped him climb to prominence in the â\\x80\\x9970s and early â\\x80\\x9980s. They had an acrimonious split in 1985 because of a million dollars Trump said she owed him. Trump, though, ultimately held no grudge, and neither did she. Her relationship with him â\\x80\\x9cebbs and flows,â\\x80\\x9d she told me. â\\x80\\x9cWhen you came out of the Brooklyn world, where Donald grew up, and where his father was so steeped, loyalty had a different connotation.â\\x80\\x9d\\nStone, meanwhile, is a Cohn protégé. Cohn introduced Stone to Trump in 1979. And Stone, who has Nixonâ\\x80\\x99s face tattooed on his back, counseled Trump in his initial dalliance with running for president in 1988, and with his short-lived Reform Party candidacy in 2000, and again early on in his 2016 campaign. Trump said he fired Stone. Stone said he fired Trump. \\nI called Stone recently to talk about their relationship, and Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s relationship with loyalty. â\\x80\\x9cWhen itâ\\x80\\x99s in his best interest to forgive you,â\\x80\\x9d Stone said, â\\x80\\x9che does.â\\x80\\x9d\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCan you give me an example?â\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re talking to one,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\nStone alienated Trump more than a decade ago when he messed with then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, as well as with Spitzerâ\\x80\\x99s father. â\\x80\\x9cRoger is a stone-cold loser,â\\x80\\x9d Trump told the New Yorker in 2008.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe somehow imagined Bernard Spitzer was his friend. And he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t believe what I did to Bernard and Eliot Spitzer. And that ended the day Spitzer went on CNN and called him a nameâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94or at least pointed out discrepancies in Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s financesâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cand suddenly he had complete amnesia, and called me and said, â\\x80\\x98Where you been? Whatâ\\x80\\x99s going on? How come I havenâ\\x80\\x99t heard from you?â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\nTo Stone, the call was not so surprisingâ\\x80\\x94heâ\\x80\\x99d been all but expecting it. â\\x80\\x9cYou see, I was wise enough, when he called me a â\\x80\\x98stone-cold loser,â\\x80\\x99 you know what I said?â\\x80\\x9d Stone explained. â\\x80\\x9cI said nothing. Iâ\\x80\\x99m pretty good at repartee. I could have returned fire. But there was no point in it.â\\x80\\x9d\\nWhy not?\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause I still believed he could be president,â\\x80\\x9d Stone said.\\nAnd here Trump is, in the Oval Office, and there Stone was, on Fox News, in the immediate wake of Michael Wolffâ\\x80\\x99s withering book, dubbing Steve Bannonâ\\x80\\x99s quotes in it â\\x80\\x9ca stunning act of betrayalâ\\x80\\x9d and Trump a â\\x80\\x9cpolitical genius.â\\x80\\x9d\\nTrump called Stone after the show.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe was very pleased with my performanceâ\\x80\\x94his words,â\\x80\\x9d Stone said. \\n***\\n The lesson Stone learned long ago has been passed down to a newer batch of Trump loyalists. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99ll let them back in, if they sufficiently, you know, push a peanut with their nose down Fifth Avenue enough times,â\\x80\\x9d biographer Gwenda Blair told me.\\nWhat does such peanut-pushing look like?\\nTake Page 263 of Let Trump Be Trump, the campaign memoir by fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and his deputy David Bossie. â\\x80\\x9cSometimes we think maybe itâ\\x80\\x99s better that we stayed on the outside,â\\x80\\x9d they wrote. â\\x80\\x9cAnd sometimes we think the boss is just waiting for the right time to bring us back.â\\x80\\x9d\\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair, former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, meanwhile, ousted after a wild week-and-a-half on the job, likened Trump to basketball great Michael Jordan. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99ll hit the shot,â\\x80\\x9d Scaramucci said of the president. â\\x80\\x9cThe shotâ\\x80\\x99s going in.â\\x80\\x9d\\nSimilarly, Senator Lindsey Graham, who in the past called Trump a â\\x80\\x9cjackassâ\\x80\\x9d and a â\\x80\\x9ckook,â\\x80\\x9d earlier this year chastised others for calling him literally the same. The Republican from South Carolina more recently has gone out of his way to call the president â\\x80\\x9cvery charmingâ\\x80\\x9d and a good golfer and â\\x80\\x9ca gracious host.â\\x80\\x9d The playbook is clear: â\\x80\\x9cSay nice things and heâ\\x80\\x99ll like you,â\\x80\\x9d Graham said utterly explicitly in an interview on CNN.\\nAnd so it was with Bannon, too, after he unleashed to Wolff for his book a litany of unflattering assessments of Trump, his oldest daughter and his oldest son, and was summarily lambasted and ostracized by the president. On a radio show, the top Trump aide promptly reiterated his support, â\\x80\\x9cday in and day out.â\\x80\\x9d He said Trump is â\\x80\\x9ca great man.â\\x80\\x9d The newly conciliatory tone hit the intended target. â\\x80\\x9cChanged his tune pretty quick,â\\x80\\x9d Trump affirmed.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs that relationship permanently broken between you and Steve?â\\x80\\x9d reporters from the Wall Street Journal asked Trump.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know what the word â\\x80\\x98permanentâ\\x80\\x99 means, OK?â\\x80\\x9d Trump said. â\\x80\\x9cI never know what the word â\\x80\\x98permanentâ\\x80\\x99 means.â\\x80\\x9d  \\nA presidency marked by such sycophancy, and led by a person whoâ\\x80\\x99s famously ahistorical, they say, is a presidency thatâ\\x80\\x99s doomed.\\n\\nThis is what worries the historians I talked to the most. Loyalty is a must. But what kind? And to what end? A presidency marked by such sycophancy, and led by a person whoâ\\x80\\x99s famously ahistorical, they say, is a presidency thatâ\\x80\\x99s doomed.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo president, with the possible exception of Andrew Johnson,â\\x80\\x9d H.W. Brands of the University of Texas told me, â\\x80\\x9chas been so susceptible to flattery as Trump seems to be. In Johnsonâ\\x80\\x99s case his weakness thoroughly disrupted Reconstruction and nearly led to his removal from office.â\\x80\\x9d Johnson, not to be confused with Jackson, is widely considered to be one of the worst presidents ever.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe people who are flattering have agendas of their own,â\\x80\\x9d Brands explained. â\\x80\\x9cAnd Bannon has his own agenda. I mean, everybody makes use of everybody else. So Trump is using Bannon, and Bannon is using Trump. The only thing about Trump is most presidents know what it is theyâ\\x80\\x99re trying to get out of a relationshipâ\\x80\\x94as in, they want support for this particular bill, that particular initiative in foreign policy. With Trump, at least it seems that all he wants is praise, simply for the sake of praise, rather than for some other goal.â\\x80\\x9d\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are the consequences of this sycophancy?â\\x80\\x9d said George C. Edwards III, a professor of political science and presidential studies at Texas A&M. â\\x80\\x9cI think that itâ\\x80\\x99s only bad. Because it means that people are less likely to tell you the truth. And presidents, many presidents, reflecting on the presidency, have said, â\\x80\\x98I really worried about what people donâ\\x80\\x99t tell me. And people saying things I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to hear. They need to tell me. Itâ\\x80\\x99s really important.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMost presidents, when they come into office, have a much more nuanced and complicated notion of loyalty than this idea of protecting the president and simply saluting and saying, â\\x80\\x98Yes, sir,â\\x80\\x99 and, â\\x80\\x98No, sir.â\\x80\\x99 And some of it may very well be rooted in the excesses of Nixon, because that highlighted the consequences of that sort of value-free embrace of loyalty,â\\x80\\x9d Russell Riley, a presidential historian at the Miller Center at the University of Virginia, told me.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDepending on whatâ\\x80\\x99s going on with the Mueller investigation, the die may already be cast on many of these things,â\\x80\\x9d Riley added. â\\x80\\x9cThe deficiencies in this management style may already have created some legal and constitutional vulnerabilities that will come back to bite him. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know. But any normal functioning White House, at some point youâ\\x80\\x99re going to have to pay the piper. And that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean heâ\\x80\\x99s not going to serve out the rest of his term. That just means the waters get choppier rather than smoother over time. Which is a hard thing to imagine, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n \\n\\t \\n\\n \\nDonald Trump is said to be secretly terrified of coronavirus, despite insisting the virus will go away if Americans keep calm (Picture: Getty)   Donald Trump is secretly terrified of catching coronavirus and is convinced a journalist will deliberately infect him with it while in the confines of Air Force One, it was claimed.\\nThe self-declared germaphobe president is said to be fully aware of how bad the coronavirus crisis could get, with aides saying he realizes his press conferences about stimulating the economy and not panicking have been sub-par.\\nA source close to the president told Vanity Fair: ‘He’s just now waking up to the fact that this is bad, and he doesn’t know how to respond.’\\nThe source added that Trump has asked Secret Service officials to screen anyone close to him who coughs for coronavirus, adding: ‘He’s definitely melting down over this.’ \\nTrump is said to be convinced that a hostile journalist will get Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, on purpose, so that they can pass it on to the 73 year-old president while flying on the presidential jet. \\nSpeaking at the US Capitol in Washington DC Tuesday, Trump sought to allay Americans’ fears over coronavirus, which has infected over 1,000 people across 34 states and killed 31.\\n \\n\\n \\nTrump, pictured at the Centers for Disease Control headquarters in Atlanta, is reportedly convinced a journalist will get coronavirus on purpose so they can pass it on to him on Air Force One (Picture: AP)  He said: ‘‘Be calm, it’s really working out. A lot of good things are going to happen… It will go away.’\\nBut sources told Vanity Fair that Trump’s plea for calm was a performance, and that he was previously gripped with a similar terror during an outbreak of Ebola in 2014. \\nAnother Republican party mole also revealed a new side to Trump’s germaphobia, saying the president despises people who practice poor food hygiene.\\nThey explained: ‘Donald is a famous germaphobe. He hates it if someone is eating nachos and dips a chip back in after taking a bite. He calls them “double dippers.”‘\\nDespite Trump’s aversion to poor hygiene, he is continuing to shake hands while out and about, with aides saying he plans to resist advice to stop doing so ‘until the very last minute.’\\nTrump angrily denied Vanity Fair’s claims on Twitter Wednesday, writing: ‘Vanity Fair Magazine, which will soon be out of business, and their third rate Fake reporters, who make up sources which don’t exist, wrote yet another phony & boring hit piece. The facts are just the opposite.

Their activities didn’t specifically promote President Donald Trump’s re-election.\\n \\n \\n But you don’t need James Bond to recognize the fact that more than any other modern American president, Trump has delivered some of what the Kremlin values most.\\n \\n \\n The issue has returned to center stage over the last month as intelligence officials update Congress on Russia’s stance toward this year’s campaign. Different intelligence briefers have offered alternative assessments of whether Russia favors Trump for the presidency, as it did in his 2016 battle against Hillary Clinton.\\n \\n \\n Trump and his aides insist a 2020 bias toward him wouldn’t make sense anyway. “We’ve been very tough on Russia,” national security adviser Robert O’Brien told a television interviewer last month.\\n \\n \\n \\n In some specific ways, the administration has indeed been “tough.” Trump has imposed new sanctions against Russian misbehavior, though reluctantly and under congressional pressure.\\n \\n \\n His Pentagon sent two aircraft carrier strike groups into the Mediterranean Sea last year to deter Russian aggression. Trump gave Ukraine lethal aid in its war with Russia.\\n \\n \\n “If you look at administration policy, it’s not all that bad,” said Steven Pifer, a former US Ambassador to Ukraine, of the Trump administration’s Russia policy.\\n \\n \\n Yet those steps represent the smaller part of the story.\\n \\n \\n The larger part is how Trump has advanced what some experts say are Russian President Vladimir Putin’s higher-level objectives: dividing the United States internally, eroding solidarity with European allies, reducing the projection of American power abroad and thereby enhancing the 21st century influence of a diminished Russian state.\\n \\n \\n Trump, who privately sought a Moscow real estate project as a 2016 candidate, frames his presidential strategy as “America First.” It envisions friendlier relations with Russia as helpful in resolving thorny foreign policy problems while he secures more favorable economic terms from longtime allies.\\n \\n \\n But Russia policy specialists see important benefits for Moscow.\\n \\n \\n After winning in 2016, Trump disdained the conclusion of US intelligence agencies that Russia intervened on his behalf. That buttressed Moscow’s attempt to disavow culpability.\\n \\n \\n Trump has assailed not just Democratic adversaries but also nonpartisan institutions such as the judiciary and the Federal Reserve, eroding public confidence in the American system itself. He has attacked executive branch officials serving under him as a hostile “deep state.” The lagging federal response to the coronavirus highlights the consequences of his governance.\\n \\n \\n Pressed by one interviewer in 2017 on his expression of respect for Russia’s president, Trump defended Putin by yielding the moral high ground on which his predecessors staked the claim of American exceptionalism. \\n \\n \\n “You think our country’s so innocent?” he asked.\\n \\n \\n Steve Hall oversaw US intelligence in countries of the former Soviet Union before retiring from the CIA in 2015 and is a CNN national security analyst. He says Putin wants a weakened US and Trump “is currently the person on the political horizon who does the best job of that for him.”\\n \\n \\n Trump sapped Western unity by slapping trade tariffs on allies in the name of “national security.” He became the first US President in the 70-year history of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to cast doubt on America’s commitment to defend member states from outside attacks by Russia or other adversaries.\\n \\n \\n \\n Trump discusses security commitments in commercial terms, suggesting they remain contingent on financial concessions from allies. Uncertainty about the protective US umbrella rattles allies to Moscow’s benefit.\\n \\n \\n “Every time the President says, ‘Gee, they haven’t paid 2% and maybe we won’t support them,’ Putin thinks that’s good,” Pifer said. “You measure power in relative terms. This is the advancement of Russian power.”\\n \\n \\n “If you give Putin the choice – destroy NATO but live with Ukraine getting arms – he’d take it,” added Duke University scholar Peter Feaver, a National Security Council special adviser to President George W. Bush. Trump’s equivocation leaves his subordinates to reassure NATO of American resolve.\\n \\n \\n Trump’s abrupt announcement of troop withdrawals from Syria last year alarmed even staunch Republican supporters. The decision, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned, “would only benefit Russia, Iran and the Assad regime” in Damascus.\\n \\n \\n And the President undercut his own signature “tough-on-Russia” initiative in the episode that led to his impeachment. He delayed military aid while pressuring a newly elected Ukrainian leader to announce investigations of what he called “corruption.”\\n \\n \\n One sought negative information about potential Democratic election rival Joe Biden. Another concerned whether Ukraine rather than Russia actually intervened in the 2016 election – a notion Trump’s former National Security Council official Fiona Hill calls a Russian propaganda fiction.\\n \\n \\n Lately the 2020 landscape Moscow confronts has changed significantly.\\n \\n \\n Just two weeks ago, the front-runner to oppose Trump was Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-styled “democratic socialist” who shares Trump’s skepticism about projecting American military power abroad.\\n \\n \\n Now, Biden’s emergence presents an option more like that in 2016, pitting Trump’s record against a more traditionally adversarial approach to US-Russia relations.\\n \\n  \\n President Donald Trump on Friday took to the podium during a Rose Garden press conference to allay concerns about the growing coronavirus outbreak in the US. \\nBut even while announcing new measures against Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, Trump continually downplayed the threat the country is facing and refused to take responsibility for the testing shortage that has left the US unable to track the unrolling pandemic. \\nAsked about whether he takes any blame for the botched testing process, Trump said, “I don’t take responsibility at all.”\\nThe big announcement came when Trump announced a national emergency, unlocking billions of dollars in disaster aid to help combat the virus. The administration previously declared a public health emergency in January, but that didn’t tap into as much money as the new declaration under the 1988 Stafford Act, which is typically used for natural disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes, will allow.\\nTrump, flanked by the leaders of Target, Walmart, and Walgreens, announced several other measures, including a public-private partnership to boost testing capacity by setting up drive-through testing sites at some pharmacies and major store chains. That includes up to 5 million more tests and a website, developed with the help of Google, to help connect people to nearby testing stations.\\nHe also announced efforts to relax laws and regulations that can limit health care capacity, including the greater use of telehealth and the elimination of some restrictions on hospital stays. He suggested that these changes will help build up capacity — a critical element to mitigating the outbreak — but it’s not clear if these will succeed.\\nAt the same time, Trump acknowledged that there’s still no agreement with Democrats in the House about a package to deal with the crisis.\\nSome of this is in line with what experts have called on to deal with the crisis, but given the administration’s history in dealing with the pandemic, it’s unclear if these measures will work as planned. And the lack of a broader deal between Trump and House Democrats means more comprehensive action isn’t quite here yet.\\nTrump continually downplayed the pandemic, even while trying to address it \\nIn between these announcements, Trump seemingly couldn’t help but downplay the risk of the crisis, while repeatedly shaking hands with other people present at the press conference. \\nImmediately after announcing the federal government will get 5 million test kits out, he said, “I doubt we’ll need anywhere near that.”\\nTrump also cautioned against too much testing capacity: “We don’t want people to take a test if we feel that they shouldn’t be doing it. And we don’t everyone running out, only if you have certain symptoms.” But while it’s true that not everyone needs to be tested, it’s these kinds of roadblocks that have led to report after report of doctors and patients struggling to get access to tests. On social media, doctors regularly complain that they can’t obtain tests for patients even if the patients display symptoms.\\nTesting is crucial to slowing epidemics. First, it lets public health officials identify sick people and subsequently isolate them. Second, they can trace that sick person’s recent contacts to make sure those people aren’t sick and to get them to quarantine as well.

He called concerns about the virus a “hoax.” He said on national television that, based on nothing more than a self-admitted “hunch,” the death rate of the disease is much lower than public health officials projected.

They gathered in the diplomatic reception room, once home to Franklin Roosevelt’s “fireside chats”, and stared at a desk with pen, documents and the presidential seal. Donald Trump strode in, wearing a black bomber jacket and white shirt unbuttoned at the top, and settled down beneath a portrait of George Washington. He signed a congressional emergency spending bill to combat the coronavirus for $8.3bn – more than three times what the president himself had requested – and held it up to a chorus of clicking cameras. “We’re doing very well,” he insisted. “But it’s an unforeseen problem. What a problem. Came out of nowhere, but we’re taking care of it.” He gazed around the oval-shaped room, wallpapered romantic American landscapes, and took questions. Someone asked: “How do you keep people from panicking?” Trump’s response in part: “Calm. You have to be calm. It’ll go away.” It has not gone away. A week later, coronavirus cases in the US have soared past 1,300, with at least 38 deaths. The stock market suffered its worst percentage drop since the 1987 Wall Street crash. On Wednesday night alone, Trump announced a travel ban on most of Europe during an Oval Office address, the National Basketball Association suspended its season and it emerged the Hollywood actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson had tested positive. The New York Post’s front page headline declared: A world turned upside down.   Trump\\'s changing reactions to coronavirus: from calm to closing borders – video report   It is at such moments of peril that a nation looks to its leader for reassurance and direction. Trump, critics say, has failed the test in both words and deeds. Uniquely unqualified, he is the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, said: “He’s an idiot. He’s handled it horribly. When things are rough, you want somebody who can exude confidence and competence and Trump does not do that. “We’ve been incredibly lucky. For the last three years, there was nothing big going on that had a real bearing on the lives of the ordinary American. This does.” The coronavirus outbreak plays to the weaknesses of Trump, a germaphobe and gut instinct politician who prefers to slug it out with human foes on Twitter. He has spent years undermining experts, institutions, scientists, media outlets, global alliances and trust in government, all of which are now needed more than ever.    His first misstep came two years ago when he disbanded the global health security team on the National Security Council (NSC) that was responsible for preparing for a pandemic. The NSC’s global health security chief, Rear Admiral Tim Ziemer, was fired the day after an Ebola outbreak was declared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last year intelligence agencies warned that the US remained vulnerable to the next flu pandemic but Trump, it seems, hoped that his long streak of political luck would hold. Distracted by impeachment in January, the president showed little urgency when the coronavirus exploded in China, apparently unwilling to sour his relationship with authoritarian leader Xi Jinping, whom he praised for having the outbreak “totally under control” even as it raced across that country and beyond. The White House did impose a limited travel ban on China but that alone was not enough. Former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner David Kessler told the Politico website: “They needed and still need to be searching for where the cases are, instead of trusting that limited travel bans were keeping out a virus that was probably already on the march.”  travel ban  Perhaps Trump’s greatest blunder was turning down the offer of a German-made diagnostic test approved by the World Health Organization and taken up by many countries. The US government’s own painfully slow progress led to a nationwide shortage of test kits at the most critical moment. It was reported that just 11,000 tests have been conducted in America so far, whereas South Korea is carrying out 10,000 tests per day. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told the Bloomberg news agency: “This is an unmitigated disaster that the administration has brought upon the population, and I don’t say this lightly. We have had a much worse response than Iran, than Italy, than China and South Korea.” It seems that Trump only began to take the issue seriously two weeks ago when he saw a 1,000-point drop on Wall Street. Even then, he urged aides, including Kellyanne Conway and senior economic adviser Larry Kudlow, to go on television and preach confidence, according to five White House officials and Republicans interviewed by the Associated Press.    Coronavirus: Trump slams reporter for \\'nasty question\\' over pandemic response team – video   Trump himself constantly downplayed the threat and contradicted his own health officials, asserting that the virus was “very much under control” and infections were “going very substantially down, not up”. On 26 February, he confidently claimed that total cases will be “close to zero”. He also accused Democrats of using the coronavirus as “their new hoax”, promised a vaccine much sooner than scientifically possible, prophesied that the virus will be killed off by warmer spring weather and kept comparing it to the common flu (though experts say coronavirus is 10 times more deadly). But the usual playbook of deny and distract proved futile against a nimble germ without an ego.  Robert Shrum, a Democratic strategist and political science professor at the University of Southern California, said: “Before it happened, he dismantled a lot of the preparedness that had been put in place under Obama and Ron Klain [Ebola czar] and Joe Biden, I suppose because they were things Obama had done so he wanted to get rid of them, like the Paris climate accords. “And since then he has over and over again contradicted his own health people and at one point tried to muzzle them. He called the coronavirus ‘a Democratic hoax’ and then they ran out to explain, ‘No, no, the hoax was that they were blaming Trump for not handling it well’. Well, I think almost universally people would say Trump has not handled this well.” Even if Trump tried to dismiss the health statistics, he could not ignore the financial markets, an obsession he has made central to his reelection. He put vice-president Mike Pence in charge of a coronavirus task force, demoting Health Secretary Alex Azar, but continued to get in the way of the message. Soon after signing the congressional funding bill last Friday, Trump donned a “Keep America great” campaign cap and visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. In remarks that many found confounding and frightening, he described the governor of Washington state as a “snake”, praised his own expertise and falsely claimed that anyone who wants a coronavirus test can get one. Pence was later forced to correct this. But on Monday the full horror of the economic implications dawned on Trump as he flew from Florida to Washington on Air Force One. In his on-board office, Fox News showed graphics illustrating the single worst day for markets since the financial crisis of 2008. Fellow passenger Matt Gaetz, a Republican congressman, had isolated himself in part of the plane after learning he had come into contact with an infected person. Trump travelled to Capitol Hill for lunch with Senate Republicans on Tuesday. He promised: “We’re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.” A day later, Dr Anthony Fauci, one of the government’s top public health experts, testified: “Bottom line, it’s going to get worse.”  The president tried to provide further reassurance in only his second Oval Office address on Wednesday night. But it had the exact opposite effect. He blindsided European governments by announcing a 30-day travel ban to keep out the “foreign virus”. He also failed to explain how tests will become available and committed factual errors the White House was forced to hastily correct. Susan Rice, former national security adviser, tweeted simply: “OMG.” Eight months from a presidential election, the virus has jeopardised Trump’s central reelection argument – a strong economy – just as Joe Biden, the candidate emerging from the Democratic field, seems poised to take advantage by offering stability and a safe pair of hands.  Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: “The most calming and reassuring presidential voice of the past 24 hours has been Joe Biden. As a Republican, this is hard for me to say but it’s true.” The coronavirus pandemic is being described as a once-in-a-lifetime event. History remembers how presidents handle such crises – and to Trump, it seems unlikely to be kind. He may be regarded as a Nero, fiddling while Rome burned.  Moe Vela, a former senior adviser to Biden, said: “He is unable to express compassion and empathy; I don’t believe he possesses those two values. This was his chance to show that he could lead, to show that he was as tough as he said he was for three years. And then what does he do? He falls on his face.” Vela, an LGBTQ and Latino activist and board director at TransparentBusiness, added: “We’re walking around in ghost towns. Kids aren’t going to school. Not enough people are getting tested. We have no clue what the reality of this pandemic is because information is being withheld and reaction from this administration was slow at best. It’s disgusting. It’s disconcerting. It’s scary as hell.”    The president seemed a little worried about the job he was doing, so on Friday at 3 p.m., he gathered a close group of older individuals to share multiple handshakes and a microphone that everyone was touching to reassure him that the coronavirus was under control. President Trump began the speech by reassuring himself. “When you compare what we’ve done to other areas of the world, it’s . . . it’s pretty incredible,” he said, which I think was intended to be positive and not to refer to the fact that the United States lags wildly behind other countries in terms of testing for the virus.  Then he declared a national emergency over the coronavirus. “Two very big words,” he commented. I realize that this is only the 85th-most-concerning part of this strange ad-lib, but — “national” and ”emergency” are only medium-sized words! ”Floccinaucinihilipilification“ — now that is a very big word! I am going, as usual, to take the president seriously but not literally, something that makes times of crisis even more confusing than they would be ordinarily. He thanked many companies for their help. He thanked Google, which was working on a website. Where was the website going to be? NO ONE KNOWS! Technically, ANY website could be the website! It is this flair for showmanship that always makes these news conferences so thrilling. Some people would say that when you are announcing an important government website to help people cope with a pandemic, you should have a clear handle on where it will be located. But actually I think this teaser created more mystery and excitement, also good things for us to have at this time of crisis.   Follow\\xa0Alexandra Petri\\'s opinionsFollow  The president later introduced a series of business leaders to compliment the job he was doing and to explain their contributions. In case you thought, “Maybe they will say useful things,” be reassured. Ninety percent of the conversation consisted of them thanking the president and touching at least the microphone if not also his physical body. Here is one example, literally verbatim: “Thomas Moriarty, CVS. We all know CVS. Thank you.” “Thank you, sir.” “Thank you, Thomas.” “Thank you, Mr. President. We have been focused since the start of making sure our patients and the customers we serve have the information we need, the safety we need as well. We are committed to working with the administration and local public health officials to make this work as well. And thank you, sir, for the honor.” “Thank you very much.” “Thank you.” “Thanks, good job.” Yes, the verbal equivalent of a CVS receipt: much longer than I needed and containing nothing of help to anyone! Vice President Pence, known for his ability to respond to outbreaks in a prompt and nonjudgmental manner, then took the microphone to speak a few words of encouragement to the president, totally spontaneous and unprompted, except by the president who asked him to say a few words. “Thank you, Mr. President. It is . . . this day should be an inspiration to every American, because thanks to your leadership from early on, not only are we bringing a whole-of-government approach to confronting the coronavirus, we’re bringing and all-of-America approach. Mr. President, from early on, you took decisive action.” (The decisive action the vice president had in mind turned out not to be the rally speech calling the virus a Democratic hoax.) He took the words right out of our mouths! I hope he washes his hands. The president did not seem to enjoy the questions he got from the media, including about why he had disbanded the White House office on pandemics (he knew nothing about it(?!?!)) and whether he planned to get tested after being exposed (“probably”). He waxed philosophical about the virus’s impact: “And we’ll be changing a lot of the rules, regulations, for future should this happen in the future, which we hope it never does, but it will, I guess, somewhere out there. There’s some bad ones over the years and, I guess that will continue to an extent.” One reporter asked Trump whether he took responsibility for the lag in testing. “No, I don’t take responsibility at all. Because we were given a . . . a set of circumstances, and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time. It wasn’t meant for this kind of . . . an event with the kind of numbers that we’re talking about.“ Oh! Okay. I love leadership. The bottom line is that as long as he is reassured, that is what matters. I’m not, but if he is! So, thank you, Mr. President! Thank you! You shouldn’t have.

In short, according to Diamond, Trump was warned \"the new coronavirus could be a major problem,\" but \"made clear - the lower the numbers on coronavirus... the better for his potential reelection.\" In this interview Diamond tells NPR\\'s Terry Gross that President Trump \"did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that\\'s partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear - the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall.\" Just to be clear, let\\'s look at that again: Trump \"did not push to do aggressive additional testing\" and \"had made clear - the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall.\" NPR took to Twitter to ensure the quote was clear, emphasizing that it was indeed President Trump\\'s decision to not push for testing – in order to keep the documented cases of coronavirus as low as possible – despite the clear public health risks. \\n \\n Seeing a lot of attention on this quote and want to be clear about what we’ve previously reported.\\n1) The presiden… https://t.co/EARZXgl9xH — Dan Diamond (@Dan Diamond)\\n 1584056142.0\\n \\n  (It does not seem to be a stretch to say that the lack of testing – for whatever reason – will likely lead to coronavirus related deaths.) Diamond says that Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar \"did go to the president in January. He did push past resistance from the president\\'s political aides to warn the president the new coronavirus could be a major problem. There were aides around Trump - Kellyanne Conway had some skepticism at times that this was something that needed to be a presidential priority.\" So Conway, who just days ago on national television lied, insisting the Trump administration had \"contained\" the coronavirus outbreak, reportedly didn\\'t think a global pandemic – it has been clear that\\'s where this was headed – was important enough to involve the President. Diamond tells Gross that \"some of the decisions behind the scenes haven\\'t always reflected the best judgment of career professionals.\" Clearly that\\'s correct. There\\'s a great deal more of how the Trump administration has not just mismanaged the coronavirus pandemic, but horrifically mismanaged the coronavirus pandemic, and in some cases to benefit Trump\\'s re-election efforts. The NPR interview is 44 minutes long. You can read it or listen to it at NPR, or listen to it below.  Image by The White House via Flickr      A senior Brazilian official who dined and was photographed with President Trump and Vice President Pence last weekend in Florida is infected with the coronavirus, marking the closest known contact between Trump and someone carrying the highly communicable illness that has shuttered many aspects of daily life across the globe and cratered financial markets.  Fabio Wajngarten, communications secretary for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, posed for a photograph with Trump and Pence at a dinner for Bolsonaro at Mar-a-Lago, the president’s private club in Palm Beach, on Saturday. Prominent members of the Trump administration and Trump family members also attended either the dinner or a party the same night in honor of former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is dating Donald Trump Jr. Trump’s contact with Wajngarten is the latest example of a potential coronavirus close call for the president, who says he is following at least some of his administration’s advice about preventing the spread of the disease but also continues to play down the threat of a potentially deadly illness.    As the first positive case of coronavirus in D.C. was announced on March 7, President Trump met with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro at Mar-a-Lago. (Video: The Washington Post)    “Let’s put it this way: I’m not concerned,” Trump said Thursday as news broke that Wajngarten had fallen ill and tested positive for the virus after returning to Brazil. Bolsonaro underwent testing and is awaiting results. Trump is not being tested and brushed off the risk Thursday. “Yeah, I did hear something about that. We had dinner together in Florida in — at Mar-a-Lago, with the entire delegation,” Trump said. “I don’t know if the press aide was there. If he was there, he was there.”    A Brazilian official, who has tested positive for covid-19, posted this video of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and President Trump at Mar-a-Lago March 7. (Video: Fabio Wajngarten/Instagram via Storyful)    “But we did nothing very unusual. We sat next to each other for a period of time, had a great conversation. He’s doing a terrific job in Brazil,” Trump said, referring to Bolsonaro. “And we’ll find out what happens. I guess they’re being tested right now, right?” Trump did not seem to remember Wajngarten well, but a photo the aide posted on social media shows him standing shoulder to shoulder with Trump, with Pence on the president’s other side. The interaction follows several instances in which Trump has spent time with members of Congress and others who had been in contact with an attendee at the Conservative Political Action Conference in late February who tested positive for the coronavirus after the conference ended. But word of the infection did not come until after Reps. Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.) and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) had spent time with Trump. Both congressmen opted to self-quarantine until it was clear they were not infected. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) announced Thursday that he is doing the same “as a precautionary measure” after attending the Mar-a-Lago dinner. Like many Americans, Graham will be working from home. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), another dinner guest, announced a self-quarantine Thursday because of attendance at Mar-a-Lago, as did the mayors of Miami and Miami-Dade County. No such announcements of quarantines or testing came on behalf of anyone at the White House — though Trump advisers Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, acting director of national intelligence Richard Grenell, national security adviser Robert C. O’Brien and others close to the president were at Mar-a-Lago that night. Some apparently met the Brazilian staffers, others did not. Donors who saw Trump in small settings this past weekend in Florida were asked when they last left the country and whether they’d had any flu-like symptoms but were not asked to undergo any additional screening, said people familiar with the arrangements who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive issue. Trump attended at least four fundraisers over the weekend, some with dozens of attendees. On Saturday, Trump interacted with a much larger group of people, including many who had not been asked screening questions. After dinner with the visiting Brazilian delegation, Trump went into the ballroom at Mar-a-Lago and stood amid the crowd and gave a toast to Guilfoyle. He was seen shaking dozens of hands throughout the packed club, attendees said. One person who was present said there is no way to know whether fellow guests were sick. “You don’t get a health screening at Mar-a-Lago obviously,” this person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private events at the club. White House officials have sought to limit foreign leader contact at the White House going forward, according to a senior administration official. Sitting alongside visiting Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar at the White House on Thursday, Trump acknowledged that he has adjusted his routine a bit. “Well, we didn’t shake hands today. And we looked at each other. We said, ‘What are we going to do?’ You know, it’s sort of a weird feeling,” Trump said to laughter. Varadkar said that the two leaders had opted for clasping their own hands together in front of their chests. He demonstrated, with a small tilt of the head. Trump noted that in other cultures, in places such as India and Japan, people do not routinely shake hands, virus or no virus, and he seemed to approve. “They were ahead of the curve, okay?” Trump said. “It’s a very strange feeling,” he said. “You know, I was never a big hand-shaker, as you probably heard. But once you become a politician, shaking hands is very normal.” Trump has described himself as a germophobe, but since entering politics he has made peace with the rope line and the rally. Trump’s rallies often place thousands of people in close quarters for hours, something the president acknowledged Thursday he is reconsidering because of the virus risk. But his motivation to continue with public events and to resist getting tested may be rooted in his aversion to any sign of weakness. People close to Trump described him as uninterested in being tested. He has told at least two advisers that if he gets sick, he will get tested. A former aide said Trump never wanted to be viewed as sick, because he saw it as being weak. So even when Trump would come down with a cough or lose his voice, he would try to keep a strong public face — or staffers would come up with other reasons to move events. The former aide spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe Trump’s behavior. Sounding somewhat dejected Thursday, Trump said he is unlikely to hold big rallies for a while. He has canceled events this weekend in Nevada and Colorado and said a previously unannounced event in Tampa is unlikely to go forward. The Secret Service has not advised Trump to stay close to home, he said. “They have not, but it’s common sense,” Trump said. “You know, a lot of it is — and what I say is: Use common sense, like washing your hands and, you know, certain things. Keep a little bit of distance away.” But still, no test, according to White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. “Exposures from the case are being assessed, which will dictate next steps,” she said in a statement Thursday. “Both the President and Vice President had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive and do not require being tested at this time.” She added that under guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “there is currently no indication to test patients without symptoms, and only people with prolonged close exposure to confirmed positive cases should self-quarantine.” Meanwhile, test results for Bolsonaro, who sat next to Trump at dinner, were expected Friday. “The medical service of the presidency of the Republic has adopted and is adopting all of the necessary preventive measures to preserve the health of the President of the Republic and the entire presidential committee that accompanied him in the recent official trip to the United States,” the presidential press office said in a statement.

(Gage Skidmore/Flickr)\\n   Dr. James S. Gordon, a clinical professor at Georgetown Medical School, has written a lengthy analysis for the San Francisco Chronicle  dissecting the way that President Donald Trump appeals to people\\'s most base instincts.  Gordon begins by reflecting on the belief among Trump\\'s evangelical supporters that the president was literally sent by God to save the United States. Although he does not take this suggestion seriously, he does think that Trump\\'s presence could serve a useful purpose in getting Americans to recognize and reflect upon our own faults. \"The prophet Trump teaches by provocation and contraries,\" he writes. \"His words, facial expressions and conduct reflect and amplify the least evolved parts of our biology and behavior: the remorseless struggle for survival that is the highest achievement of the reptilian part of our brain and the fears, rages and insecurities that flourish in primitive parts of our limbic system, our emotional brain.\" Gordon argues that Trump\\'s relentless need for attention and his penchant for fear mongering serves to bring out the worst in both his followers and his opponents -- but he sees it as an opportunity to rise above our most primitive instincts. \"The insecurity that feeds Trump’s self-importance invites me to be more modest; his disregard for the truth shows me how vital it is for me to be honest; his greed shames me to greater generosity; his self-justification and self-righteousness invite me to deepened awareness of similar tendencies I may have; his fear of the \\'other\\' challenges me to always take chances on mutual understanding,\" he writes.  Read the whole article here.   “Do me a favor, speed it up, speed it up.” This is what Donald Trump told the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference, recounting what he said to pharmaceutical executives about the progress toward a vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Anthony Fauci, the longtime leader of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been telling the president repeatedly that developing the vaccine will take at least a year and a half – the same message conveyed by pharmaceutical executives. Apparently, Trump thought that simply repeating his request would change the outcome.   China has rightfully taken criticism for squelching attempts by scientists to report information during the outbreak. Now, the United States government is doing similar things. Informing Fauci and other government scientists that they must clear all public comments with Mike Pence, the vice-president, is unacceptable. This is not a time for someone who denies evolution, the climate crisis and the dangers of smoking to shape the public message. Thank goodness Fauci, Francis Collins, the director of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), and their colleagues across federal agencies are willing to soldier on and are gradually getting the message out. While scientists are trying to share facts about the epidemic, the administration either blocks those facts or restates them with contradictions. Transmission rates and death rates are not measurements that can be changed with will and an extroverted presentation. The administration has repeatedly said – as it did last week – that virus spread in the United States is contained, when it is clear from genomic evidence that community spread is occurring in Washington state and beyond. That kind of distortion and denial is dangerous and almost certainly contributed to the federal government’s sluggish response. After three years of debating whether the words of this administration matter, the words are now clearly a matter of life and death. And although the steps required to produce a vaccine could possibly be made more efficient, many of them depend on biological and chemical processes that are essential. So the president might just as well have said, “Do me a favor, hurry up that warp drive.” I don’t expect politicians to know Maxwell’s equations for electromagnetism or the Diels-Alder chemical reaction (although I can dream). But you can’t insult science when you don’t like it and then suddenly insist on something that science can’t give on demand. For the past four years, Trump’s budgets have made deep cuts to science, including cuts to funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the NIH. With this administration’s disregard for science of the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the stalled naming of a director for the Office of Science and Technology Policy – all to support political goals – the nation has had nearly four years of harming and ignoring science. Now, the president suddenly needs science. But the centuries spent elucidating fundamental principles that govern the natural world – evolution, gravity, quantum mechanics – involved laying the groundwork for knowing what we can and cannot do. The ways that scientists accumulate and analyze evidence, apply inductive reasoning and subject findings to scrutiny by peers have been proven over the years to give rise to robust knowledge. These processes are being applied to the Covid-19 crisis through international collaboration at breakneck, unprecedented speed; Science published two new papers earlier this month on Sars-CoV-2, and more are on the way. But the same concepts that are used to describe nature are used to create new tools. So, asking for a vaccine and distorting the science at the same time are shockingly dissonant. A vaccine has to have a fundamental scientific basis. It has to be manufacturable. It has to be safe. This could take a year and a half – or much longer. Pharmaceutical executives have every incentive to get there quickly – they will be selling the vaccine after all – but thankfully, they also know that you can’t break the laws of nature to get there. Maybe we should be happy. Earlier in his administration, the president declared his skepticism of vaccines and tried to launch an anti-vaccine taskforce. Now he suddenly loves vaccines. But do us a favor, Mr President. If you want something, start treating science and its principles with respect. \\n  H Holden Thorp is the editor in chief of Science \\n   Do Us a Favor by H Holden Thorp, in SCIENCE 367: 1169 (13 March 2020), was republished with permission from AAAS \\n    President Trump said Friday that he has not yet been tested for the novel coronavirus, even as three people who were with him at the Mar-a-Lago Club last weekend have now tested positive. Trump said he would be tested “fairly soon. We’re working on that. We’re working out a schedule.”  In one televised event, Trump seemed to defy two basic practices that the rest of his government has been urging Americans to follow to prevent the spread of the virus. People who were exposed to an infected person are urged to quarantine themselves and seek testing. And everyone — exposed or not — should stop shaking hands. But at a Friday news conference on efforts to combat the coronavirus, Trump continued to shake hands with other speakers, many of whom are members of the White House Task Force charged with trying to stem the disease. Trump and many of the speakers took part in backslapping and adjusting the shared microphone. Trump also said he will not self-quarantine, as members of Congress and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have chosen to do after known exposures. “No. We have no symptoms whatsoever,” Trump said. In his case, Trump suggested the risk of exposure from a Brazilian official was low, even though the two had posed for a photo together. Trump said he had posed for so many photos, and shaken so many hands, that he did not remember the man. “I take pictures and it lasts for literally seconds. I don’t know the gentleman that we’re talking about. I have no idea who he is,” Trump said. “I take sometimes hundreds of pictures a day and that night, I was taking hundreds of pictures. So, I just don’t know.” Late Friday, the White House issued a memo from Trump’s White House physician, Navy Cmdr. Sean P. Conley, that said the president does not need to be either tested or quarantined. Conley’s memo acknowledged the second positive test among people included in a dinner Trump attended at his Florida resort last weekend. “The president’s exposure to the first individual was extremely limited (photograph, handshake), and though he spent more time in closer proximity to the second case, all interactions occurred before any symptom onset,” the memo read. Numerous other U.S. government officials have repeatedly warned Americans that\\xa0the virus can be transmitted before patients have symptoms. Even limited contact, such as standing next to an infected person as Trump and Vice President Pence did in Florida, can lead to infection. “These interactions would be categorized as LOW risk for transmission per CDC guidelines, and as such, there is no indication for home quarantine at this time,” Conley’s memo said. The memo went on to say that since Trump “remains without symptoms, testing for COVID-19 is not currently indicated.” It was not clear early Saturday whether than meant that Trump had decided not to be tested after all. \\xa0 Trump’s words and behavior seemed to signal that he still may be underestimating the diseases’s threat to the country — and even to his own health. As thousands of schools close, sports leagues suspend games, and American cities retreat into an eerie emptiness in the name of limiting the disease’s spread, the president’s actions seemed out of step. Public health and medical experts have urged people to stop shaking hands, touching their faces, limit large gatherings and self-isolate if they have come into contact with a confirmed case of the coronavirus because the disease spreads easily. Trump has continued to shake hands even though he has come into close contact with a number of people and, at 73, is in a high-risk age group. On Friday, the Brazilian Embassy in Washington said that its ambassador, Nestor Forster — who sat at Trump’s table during a dinner Saturday night at Mar-a-Lago — had tested positive for the coronavirus. Forster is the second Brazilian official who visited Mar-a-Lago that night and then was diagnosed with the fast-spreading virus: Fabio Wajngarten, the communications secretary for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, tested positive on Wednesday. Wajngarten had posed for a photo with Trump; Forster, the newly diagnosed ambassador, seems to have been in even more prolonged close contact with the president. On Friday, Republican officials also said a guest of a donor who attended a Sunday luncheon at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club had later tested positive for the virus. “As you may have had contact with this individual, please contact your medical provider if you or any of your loved ones is ill” or shows symptoms like fever or shortness of breath, donors were told, according to a copy of the warning obtained by The Washington Post. At the time, Trump did not seem to believe the coronavirus could pose much of a risk to his personal health. According to an account of the Sunday lunch, shared with The Post by one attendee, Trump even joked about getting the virus — referring to a donor in the room who Trump said had shaken hands with him twice. The man was a doctor, Trump said, and his hands were oddly clammy. Trump said that, after they shook, sweat from the man’s hand was left behind on his own. “If you hear any bad things about the health of our president, there’s the guy,” Trump said, according to the account. “The president’s not looking good? Get that doctor. Find out who the hell that guy was.” The audience laughed. Republican officials say the attendee who tested positive was in the audience but did not have personal contact with Trump at the lunch, which was attended by about 1,000 people. The White House declined to comment on Trump’s remarks at the gathering. The same weekend, Trump met with the visiting Brazilian delegation — posing for a photo with Bolsonaro’s communications secretary, Fabio Wajngarten, who later tested positive for the virus. On Friday, Bolsonaro said he had tested negative for the virus. But another person who met with the visiting Brazilian delegation — Miami Mayor Francis Suarez — also later tested positive, according to a spokesperson for Suarez. At Mar-a-Lago itself, one of the biggest events of the winter social season — a 700-person lunch titled “Wine, Women and Shoes” — was postponed on Friday, a day before it was supposed to occur. The brunch’s sponsor, an animal shelter called Big Dog Ranch Rescue, said they were heeding a warning from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) to avoid large gatherings. “The well-being of our incredible supporters, vendors and staff is paramount,” the shelter’s founder, Lauree Simmons, said in a statement. She also cited reports of two people testing positive in surrounding Palm Beach County. But Mar-a-Lago itself remained open to members. The Trump Organization — which operates hotels, golf clubs and resorts in 11 states — does not appear to have closed any of its properties. “The safety of our members and guests are of our utmost importance,” the Trump Organization wrote in a statement. “We are monitoring all of our businesses closely and are following the guidelines provided by the CDC.” Some of the Trump Organization’s customers, however, have begun to cancel upcoming events. A group of Texas bankers had canceled a reception planned for Trump’s hotel in Washington, D.C., and a conference for the auto-repair industry had been postponed at Trump’s Doral resort outside Miami. At Mar-a-Lago, the club had already lost at least one other event — a private party scheduled for Wednesday — according to an email sent to club members. But the club told members it was making only minor changes. In a message to members on Thursday, which was obtained by The Post, the club said its seafood buffet had been canceled — replaced with an Italian dinner served “a la carte.” “Instead of having the buffets, they’ll be plating all dinners,” said Mar-a-Lago member Suzi Goldsmith — a founder of a group of Trump superfans called the Trumpettes USA. “That’s the only change. On Tuesdays we have a prime rib buffet, and on Wednesdays it’s the seafood buffet. But rather than doing the buffets, it will be regular plated dinners.” Goldsmith said the club had not notified members about the Brazilian visitor’s positive test. Still, Goldsmith said she felt well-protected and was planning to eat dinner at the club on both Saturday and Sunday. “They certainly wouldn’t want anything to happen to any of the members or the employees,” Goldsmith said. She is also a patron of Trump International Golf Club in nearby West Palm Beach. “I’m almost thinking that Trump International and Mar-a-Lago are the safest places to eat right now,” Goldsmith said. But on Friday, several other people associated with the club said they felt left in the dark about the Brazilian official’s test — wondering if they should be tested themselves, with no guidance from the club. “Until now, the atmosphere over there has been business as usual, in the same kind of ultra-optimistic front that [Trump’s] been putting out on every level,” said one person familiar with the club, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid alienating Trump’s company officials. “That’s the prevailing atmosphere there. Nobody’s going to ring any bells until he allows that.” Josh Dawsey and Yasmeen Abutaleb in Washington and Lori Rozsa in Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.   \\nThe New York Times: Digital and Home Delivery Subscriptions\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Offer for a New York Times All Access subscription; current subscribers not eligible.

Berlin is trying to stop Washington from poaching CureVac, a firm working towards a vaccine - as German politicians insist no country should have a monopoly on such a drug. German government sources said the U.S. administration was looking into how it could gain access to a potential vaccine being developed by the firm. Earlier, the Welt am Sonntag German newspaper reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered funds to lure CureVac to the United States, and the German government was making counter-offers to tempt it to stay. \"The German government is very interested in ensuring that vaccines and active substances against the new coronavirus are also developed in Germany and Europe,\" a Health Ministry spokeswoman said, confirming a quote in the newspaper. \\n\\n\\n\\n (\\nImage:\\nARMANDO BABANI/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\\n\\n \"In this regard, the government is in intensive exchange with the company CureVac,\" she added.

She declined to comment on any takeover possibilities but referred to Germany\\'s foreign trade law, under which Berlin can examine takeover bids from non-EU, so-called third countries \"if national or European security interests are at stake\". There was no comment immediately available from the U.S. embassy in Berlin when contacted by Reuters on Sunday over the report, and nobody was available to comment at CureVac. Welt am Sonntag said CureVac declined to comment.

The privately-held company based in Tuebingen, Germany hopes to have an experimental vaccine ready by June or July to then seek the go-ahead from regulators for testing on humans. On its website, CureVac said CEO Daniel Menichella early this month met Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force and senior representatives of pharmaceutical and biotech companies to discuss a vaccine. Karl Lauterbach, a professor of health economics and epidemiology who is also a senior lawmaker with Germany\\'s Social Democrats, tweeted in reaction to the Welt am Sonntag report: \"The exclusive sale of a possible vaccine to the USA must be prevented by all means.

During the summer of 2009, we began seeking information from those who had reportedly been close friends of Epstein, including\\xa0Donald Trump and Bill Clinton, and I issued subpoenas demanding that they tell us what they knew. The first of Epstein’s powerful friends to respond in a meaningful way was Trump. He explained that he was a business acquaintance of Epstein from many years earlier. He said the two had attended many of the same events and parties, but that he was not as close with Epstein as the media had made it seem. I reminded Trump that he had been quoted in a 2002 New York magazine article stating: ‘I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it – Jeffrey enjoys his social life.’  Close: Donald Trump posing with future wife Melania, Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at the Mar-a-Lago club in Florida in 2000  Trump had an answer for this, saying when that article was being written, Epstein called him to say he needed people to say nice things. So he’d asked Trump if he would attribute the quote –written by Jeff himself – as his own words. As it was long before the allegations of Epstein’s abuse surfaced, Trump had agreed. Trump did say that he always saw Epstein around younger girls, but to his knowledge, none was under age. He said Epstein was not secretive about his lifestyle and whether it was at a party, a private event, or a public event, there were always multiple young women at his side. I asked about a rumour that Trump had expelled Epstein from the Mar-a-Lago club for trying to take the 15-year-old daughter of a member home with him. Trump paused before saying that something along those lines happened, but he could not recall the exact details. He had not spoken with Epstein in years, he said. The last time he remembered seeing Epstein personally was one day when he went to Epstein’s house in Palm Beach for a business meeting, and that was before Epstein’s legal troubles came to light. Trump recalled he had seen young women who, Epstein explained, were part of a mentoring-type programme that he was involved in. Trump admitted this was odd and then quickly said to me: ‘The guy was always strange. Even back when I ran into him more, I never really liked him.’  Trump did say that he always saw Epstein around younger girls, but to his knowledge, none was under age, writes Bradley Edwards (pictured: Trump is shown on video with Epstein)   American financier Epstein (left) and Trump (right) as they pose together at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, in 1997 (file photo)  I met Trump again in 2015, when he again maintained that his relationship with Epstein was primarily based on business. Over the next few years, I spoke to several witnesses who told us that they had been introduced by Epstein to Trump. Some had seen him at Epstein’s office, others at one of Epstein’s homes, at parties or social events, and even on his plane. In fact, Epstein bragged to certain young women in his life about how he had bailed Trump out of bankruptcy and how he was indebted to him. Last year, I saw a 1992 video of Epstein and Trump together, suggesting that they were closer social friends than I had been made to understand. I spoke to several witnesses, some of whom said they had been introduced by Epstein to Trump. Some had seen him at Epstein’s office, others at one of Epstein’s homes, at parties or social events, and even on Epstein’s plane. And Epstein was happy to use his name when trying to pressure me into dropping the legal action. ‘There is no way they will prosecute me,’ he said. ‘This will go all the way up to the Attorney General. You know Trump was my friend and [Attorney General William] Barr is his boy.’ That said, whether Trump was ever a closer friend than he let on was of no real concern to me. None of the people I interviewed who had met Trump through Epstein claimed that he had engaged in any improper sexual activity, nor did they say that Trump was around when minors were present. © Bradley J Edwards, 2020\\xa0 By The Mail on Sunday, based on Relentless Pursuit: My Fight For The Victims Of Jeffrey Epstein, by Bradley J Edwards, published by S&S on March 31, priced at £20.

Trump called up executives from major American companies like Walmart and CVS to say a few words about how they planned to work with the White House. Trump praised the executives as “celebrities in their own right,” called them “geniuses,” and tried to get reporters to ask the CEOs questions instead of him.

After he came into contact with congressmen who were exposed to the virus, he said it was no big deal.  And after a Brazilian official with whom he posed for a photograph at his Mar-a-Lago estate contracted the disease, Trump shrugged it off, saying at a Friday news conference that he did not need to be tested. Then, a few minutes later, he said he probably would get tested. Hours after that, however, the White House emailed out a statement from Trump’s physician that said the president was fine and did not need a test.  But on Saturday, Trump said he was tested Friday night, apparently as a precaution, and he told reporters his body temperature was “totally normal.” Hours later, the White House physician announced Trump tested negative for the virus. Trump’s announcement and test results capped days of evasiveness by the White House and Trump’s own refusal to submit to the same rules and standards his administration is asking the rest of the nation to adopt to slow the spread of the pandemic. His reluctance to get tested also fed into criticism that Trump was not taking the virus outbreak seriously enough, even as he praised the job he and his administration have done. “The results are very, very good, and when you compare this with what is happening around the world, we are very proud of our people,” he said Saturday. Trump’s testing announcement appeared to catch some aides off guard, including Vice President Pence, especially given that the president’s physician released a memo hours earlier stating that the risk for Trump was “low.” The abrupt pivot came as the White House appeared to be enacting new screening measures, announcing that anyone in proximity to Trump or Pence would have their temperatures taken. White House correspondents were screened ahead of the briefing, and one was turned away after aides said the journalist had a fever reading of above 100.4 degrees on three successive measurements from a noncontact thermometer. Whether the moves were taken to demonstrate additional seriousness in the face of the global pandemic or over fears for Trump’s health, they came after weeks in which the president sought to play down the risks and touted the nation’s relatively low, although quickly growing, number of confirmed cases and deaths. Experts said they expect the cases to grow exponentially, even as the administration has implemented new travel restrictions and other measures. In recent weeks, as cities and states began banning large gatherings, airlines and cruises were grounded, professional sports leagues canceled their seasons, and schools shut down, Trump appeared determined to carry on with business as usual, in an apparent effort to bolster public confidence. He has continued to shake hands with supporters and aides, met with more than 1,000 donors at his private Mar-a-Lago resort the previous weekend, and has interacted with several congressmen who later self-quarantined, as well as the Brazilian delegation that has multiple officials who have tested positive for coronavirus. Experts have called Trump’s behavior a risky and irresponsible example for a nation in the midst of a burgeoning health crisis and amid the exhortations of medical experts that all Americans should practice social distancing to help slow the spread of the virus. Asked Saturday if his shift to more prudent personal conduct aimed to demonstrate greater urgency, Trump insisted that “this was urgent for me right from the beginning,” citing his early decision to ban travel from China, where the illness originated. He said he agreed it would be wise not to shake hands and that he had long viewed the practice as unsanitary, but he explained that it was difficult for him to break the habit since becoming president. “Political people, they walk up to me and want to shake my hand,” Trump said. “It’s sort of a natural reflex. We’re all getting out of it. All of us have that problem.” The president spent the previous weekend at his private resort in Palm Beach, Fla., that was teeming with an eclectic mix of visitors: donors attending the annual Republican National Committee retreat, a delegation led by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, and family and friends celebrating the birthday of Kimberly Guilfoyle, the former Fox News host who is dating Donald Trump Jr. Among the guests were Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, as well as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who both self-quarantined last week — Gaetz after flying home to Washington with Trump aboard Air Force One. “It was louder and wilder than usual,” said one person who was there and spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private scene. Graham said there were up to 500 people at the birthday celebration alone. “It’s hard to tell who you’ve met and who you didn’t,” he said in an interview, as guests assess their potential exposure risk after the fact. Trump arrived on March 6 after spending the day touring tornado-damaged sections of Nashville and visiting the Centers for Disease Control headquarters in Atlanta for a coronavirus update. At his resort that evening, Trump told the donors that “nobody is blaming us” for the virus, according to an account from another guest who asked for anonymity to quote the president’s private remarks. Despite big drops in the stock markets, the president seemed eager to spin the potential upside — that the closing of borders around the world would promote his “America First” agenda. “Certain industries are going to be hit very hard — cruise ships and airlines and certain industries,” the president said, according to the guest. “But at the same time, I’ve been saying for a long time people should stay in our country and travel in our country, and that’s going to happen.” Observers said Trump appeared to be in a good mood and exhibited no personal concerns about the virus, despite the large number of people in the facility. Since the weekend, however, at least four people who were at the resort have tested positive for the coronavirus. That includes three Brazilians who interacted with Trump — Bolsonaro’s communications secretary Fabio Wajngarten, who took a photo with him, and two who attended the dinner, including acting Brazilian ambassador Nestor Forster Jr. RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, who led the donors conference at the resort, confirmed to The Washington Post on Saturday that she has been tested for the virus and is awaiting the results while in self-quarantine in Michigan after exhibiting flu-like symptoms. To national security experts, the scene at Mar-a-Lago raised flags about the ad hoc nature of Trump’s interactions at his private venues and the relatively unregulated access that guests have to him. “That’s how Trump does business among friends, and he considers Bolsonaro and his delegation as a group of friends,” said Fernando Cutz, who served as Western Hemisphere director at the National Security Council before leaving in 2018. “Bolsonaro’s son was there. Trump likes that. He feels connected to the thought of the children of the president being involved. That plays a role in it. He was acting in a very unguarded, friendly, Mar-a-Lago-type way.” In a photo posted to Wajngarten’s social media, Trump and Pence are seen posing with the Bolsonaro aide and a Brazilian businessman, with the president clutching a “Make Brazil Great Again” hat. Wajngarten initially dismissed Brazilian news reports that he tested positive, but the government acknowledged that he had. Bolsonaro’s office said the Brazilian president tested negative. “There was somebody who they say has it. I have no idea who he is,” Trump said at a White House news conference Friday. “I haven’t seen the pictures. I take hundreds of pictures a day. That night I was taking hundreds of pictures so I don’t know.” Brazilian officials and other guests said the White House asked basic screening questions of at least some who were in proximity to the president, including where they had traveled recently and whether they felt ill. But it does not appear that guests had their temperatures taken. Experts have said that those infected with coronavirus can be asymptomatic and still pass the illness to others. After the dinner, some in the Brazilian delegation joined Trump and other U.S. officials at Guilfoyle’s birthday party. Trump offered a toast to the group for their “energy.” Ivanka Trump and Kushner also gave toasts, according to one of the people who was at the resort, and Graham gave a speech lauding Guilfoyle for being the political opposite of liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). In all, Trump attended at least four fundraisers throughout the weekend, said a person familiar with his schedule, and he introduced some donors to Bolsonaro. On Friday, Trump’s campaign sent an email to donors alerting them that more than one guest had tested positive for coronavirus and urging them to consult doctors if they show symptoms. The day after the dinner with Bolsonaro, Trump again addressed the GOP donors. “We’ve done good,” he said of the administration’s coronavirus response, according to the guest who relayed his remarks to The Post. “But no matter what we do, it will never be good for the press. Because they’re using this to try and win an election.” The president did not yet know that the virus had penetrated the confines of his oceanfront resort as he continued: “They’re trying to scare everybody, from meetings, cancel the meetings, close the schools — you know, destroy the country. And that’s ok, as long as we can win the election. But I really believe that if they see that the Trump administration is handling this virus in a professional, competent way, I don’t believe that’s going to hurt us.” Mar-a-Lago will likely be hosting fewer events as efforts to thwart the spread of the virus ramp up. The Republican Party of Palm Beach County was scheduled to have its annual Lincoln Day Dinner at the club on Friday but had to postpone it. They have held it there the past couple of years, and last year, 700 people attended. “In light of the national emergency, and also concern of folks who don’t want to be around large crowds, we decided to postpone it,” said Michael Barnett, chairman of the county party. “We’re going to schedule it for sometime in late April or May.” It will still be at Mar-a-Lago, he said. “We wouldn’t want to have it anywhere else.” Jose Del Real in Washington, Lori Rozsa in Miami and Terrence McCoy in Rio de Janeiro contributed to this report.

He did push past resistance from the president’s political aides to warn the president the new coronavirus could be a major problem. There were aides around Trump – Kellyanne Conway had some skepticism at times that this was something that needed to be a presidential priority.”\\nSo Conway, who just days ago on national television lied, insisting the Trump administration had “contained” the coronavirus outbreak, reportedly didn’t think a global pandemic – it has been clear that’s where this was headed – was important enough to involve the President.\\nDiamond tells Gross that “some of the decisions behind the scenes haven’t always reflected the best judgment of career professionals.”\\nClearly that’s correct.\\nThere’s a great deal more of how the Trump administration has not just mismanaged the coronavirus pandemic, but horrifically mismanaged the coronavirus pandemic, and in some cases to benefit Trump’s re-election efforts.

Trump was at his private Mar-a-Lago resort last weekend, along with a mix of donors attending the Republican National Committee retreat; friends celebrating the birthday of Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is dating Donald Trump Jr.; and a delegation from Brazil that included at least one person who later tested positive for coronavirus.  According to a GOP donor who spoke with The Washington Post, Trump seemed confident that he wouldn’t take any blame for mishandling the crisis and that there could even be a benefit to the pandemic ― a boost for his own political agenda:   At his resort that evening, Trump told the donors that “nobody is blaming us” for the virus, according to an account from another guest who asked for anonymity to quote the president’s private remarks. Despite big drops in the stock markets, the president seemed eager to spin the potential upside — that the closing of borders around the world would promote his “America First” agenda. “Certain industries are going to be hit very hard — cruise ships and airlines and certain industries,” the president said, according to the guest. “But at the same time, I’ve been saying for a long time people should stay in our country and travel in our country, and that’s going to happen.”   The White House did not immediately return a request for comment.  From the beginning, Trump has seemed to be more concerned about closing off borders than taking other measures to fight the disease. During his first address to the nation on the topic, he characterized it as a “foreign virus” and touted his travel restrictions with China. He has since closed the U.S. to visitors from 28 countries in Europe.   The Department of Homeland Security has also used the disease as an excuse to further restrict migration at the U.S.-Mexico border. “Large, uncontrolled migrant flows to the U.S. that overwhelm our system and crowd our facilities presently pose a clear and present health risk to Americans,” DHS claimed in an update sent to lawmakers, according to The Wall Street Journal.  Trump and anti-immigration activists have long claimed that immigrants carry diseases into the United States.  The president still seems to believe that he bears no responsibility for the spread of the coronavirus ― even though he consistently tried to downplay its severity, saying it would simply disappear on its own by April. As recently as Friday, when he held a press conference in the Rose Garden on his administration’s coronavirus response, he was not modeling best practices to avoid spreading the disease, standing closely with a group of people and shaking their hands. Trump acted surprised when one of the business leaders opted for an elbow bump. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised people to minimize contact with each other.   “I don’t take responsibility at all,” Trump said during the press conference.

Alex Brandon/Associated Press    The Trump administration has also instituted new health screenings for travelers returning from Europe.  But the new restrictions, just announced Friday, have caused dangerous conditions at airports that could be leading to increased transmission of the disease. Footage from Saturday showed passengers packed into long lines, often waiting hours to get through screenings.

Fabio Wajngarten, press secretary for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, posed for a picture with Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Bolsonaro at Trump\\'s Florida resort over the weekend that he posted on Instagram. The press office at Brazil\\'s presidential palace confirmed to NBC News Thursday that Wajngarten had tested positive for the coronavirus. His condition was not immediately clear. The office said he is in home quarantine. Bolsonaro is being monitored as well, the press office said in a statement. \"The Medical Service of the Presidency of the Republic has adopted and is taking all necessary preventive measures to preserve the health of the President of the Republic and of the entire presidential committee that accompanied him on a recent official trip to the United States,\" the statement said.  Brazil\\'s Chief of the Secretariat of Social Communication (SECOM) Fabio Wajngarten in Brasilia, on Jan. 29, 2020.Adriano Machado / Reuters  \"The Brazilian government has also already informed the US government authorities of the event so that they can also take the necessary precautionary measures,\" the statement added. Asked about the pair being tested, Trump told reporters at the White House, \"I did hear something about that. We had dinner together in Florida at Mar-a-Lago with the entire delegation. I don’t know if the press aide was there.\" Trump, who made the remarks during a meeting with Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, said he \"did nothing very unusual\" with Bolsonaro, who\\'d previously called the concerns about the coronavirus outbreak \"fantasy.\" \"We sat next to each other for a period of time, had a great conversation. He’s doing a terrific job in Brazil and we’ll find out what happened. I guess he’s being tested right now,\" Trump said, but \"I’m not concerned.\" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement a short time later that Pence would not be tested either, but assured that officials \"are monitoring the situation closely.\" \"Both the president and vice president had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive and do not require being tested at this time,\" Grisham said. “To reiterate CDC guidelines, there is currently no indication to test patients without symptoms, and only people with prolonged close exposure to confirmed positive cases should self-quarantine.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, a top Trump ally who was also at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend, \"has no recollection of direct contact with the president of Brazil\" or his spokesman, but \"in an abundance of caution and upon the advice of his doctor,\" has decided to self-quarantine while awaiting the results of a coronavirus test, his office said. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fl., meanwhile, announced he was going to self-quarantine because he met with Bolsonaro and other officials in Miami on Monday. \"While I do not believe I interacted with the infected person, that individual was in the same room as me,\" Scott said. \"After consulting with the Senate’s attending physician and my personal doctor, I have been told that my risk is low, and I don’t need to take a test or quarantine. However, the health and safety of the American people is my focus and I have made the decision to self-quarantine in an abundance of caution,\" Scott added. Over the weekend, Trump also came into contact with two Republican congressmen — Reps. Doug Collins of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida — prior to their decisions to self-quarantine after being exposed to someone infected with the coronavirus at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland. Neither has reported having any symptoms. Trump said on Tuesday he hadn\\'t been tested for the virus on the recommendation of the White House physician. \"I feel extremely good, I feel very good. But I guess it\\'s not a big deal to get tested, and it\\'s something I would do. But, again, I spoke to the White House doctor — terrific guy, talented guy — he said he sees no reason to do it, there\\'s no symptoms, no anything,\" he said at the time. <div><article><header><p>They’re confident, for perhaps the first time in his presidency, that the experts on call aren’t out to sabotage the president.</p><div><figure><div></div><figcaption>Credit...Brittany Greeson for The New York Times</figcaption></figure></div><div><p><time>Published March 14, 2020Updated July 1, 2020</time></p></div></header><section><div><p>In the small town of Jonesborough, Tenn., nestled in the Appalachian Mountains, the Parent Teacher Association group text chat normally lights up with news of school dances and car-pooling schedules.

But the rotund, hairy omnivores were apparently an alarmingly regular topic of conversation in the White House during the early months of Donald Trump’s presidency, according to Daily Beast reporters Lachlan Markay and Asawin Suebsaeng. The authors detail Trump’s preoccupation in their new book, Sinking in the Swamp: How Trump’s Minions and Misfits Poisoned Washington.   Along with detailing “the murky underworld of President Trump’s Washington, dishing the hilarious and frightening dirt on the charlatans, conspiracy theorists, ideologues, and run-of-the-mill con artists who have infected the highest echelons of American political power”, they also discuss Trump’s fascination with badgers. Over two pages, Markay and Suebsaeng explain that Trump would interrogate his former chief of staff Reince Priebus about the black, white and grey creatures. The questions would arise at such opportune moments as “when Priebus was attempting to brief the president on matters of healthcare initiatives, foreign policy, or Republican legislative agenda”, they wrote. “Are they mean to people?” Trump reportedly asked Priebus, perhaps thinking of badgers’ very long claws, which they use to dig the burrows that make their home. “Or are they friendly creatures?” Trump would also demand to see photos of badgers, ask Priebus to give details on how badgers “work”, and wanted to know if they had a “personality” or were boring. Priebus was also called upon to explain “how the critters function and behave, what kind of food they like, and how aggressive or deadly they could be when presented with perceived existential threats”. Markay and Suebsaeng said Trump would frequently derail important policy discussions with questions about the animals. “An obviously enthralled president would stare at Priebus as the aide struggled for sufficiently placating answers, all the while trying to gently veer the conversation back to whether we were going to do a troop surge in Afghanistan or strip millions of Americans of healthcare coverage,” they wrote. Trump did not specify which of the 11 species of badger he especially wanted to understand, but given he appeared to be obsessed with the animal due to its association with Priebus’s home state of Wisconsin, it was most likely the American badger – scientific name Taxidea taxus – that commanded his attention. Wisconsin is known as the “badger state” less for the animal – which is found in many US states – than for its mining history. In the early 1800s, iron ore miners in the state would live inside the caves they were digging, and became known as “badger boys” or “badgers”. The European badger, which is found in the UK, lives in a system of underground tunnels and chambers called a sett. Some setts have a section that is used as a bathroom.

Photo: AP Photo    Coronavirus is the first major crisis Donald Trump has faced that is not of his own making. People who know what it is like to be in charge when disaster strikes have warned us this moment would come eventually – and we can now see why they were so terrified. Trump in a time of coronavirus is a lethal combination. Everything about the president – his reliance on his gut instincts in place of expertise, his overwhelming selfishness, and his unfailing tendency to lash out at others when things go wrong – make him the worst person imaginable to hold the world’s most powerful job in the face of pandemic. Confronting the threat requires global cooperation, perhaps more than at any time since the second world war. But Trump and his junior imitators around the world have taken a sledgehammer to the very notion of international solidarity.   America’s closest allies were given no notice of his decision on Wednesday night to suspend flights from Europe. The EU mission in Washington only found out about it when journalists started calling. The president has dealt with coronavirus the same way he approached every other challenge in his administration, first trying denial – and when that failed, blaming outsiders. The disease has slid from a Democratic “hoax” to the “foreign virus”. It came as little surprise that his speech had been written by Stephen Miller, the author of the administration’s cruellest anti-immigration policies. The declaration of a European travel ban was only the second time Trump has addressed the nation from behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. The first time was to announce the building of a wall on the Mexican border. The administration has made xenophobia its defining ethos. It can stir up passions and corral votes, but railing against foreigners is useless against a virus that is indifferent to ethnicity and nationality. Slamming the gates shut is also pointless in the face of a disease that already has taken hold within. Its incidence appears lower in the US than in much of Europe so far – but almost certainly because US has barely started testing. And the US is only shutting some of its gates. The exclusion of the UK and non-Schengen countries like Ireland from the ban makes no sense if stopping the spread of disease is really the aim. Contrary to Trump’s claim, the UK is not doing a “great job” in containing coronavirus compared with most of its European neighbours. It may or may not be a coincidence that Trump has golf resorts in the UK and Ireland. Given Trump’s preoccupation with his investments throughout his time in office, it is as plausible an explanation as any for an otherwise pointless decision. On the one strategy known to be effective in curbing the pandemic – screening for the virus and organised social distancing – the US is far behind most of the countries it has now cut off. The production and distribution of diagnostic tests has been a fiasco. The initial test distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was flawed and had to be recalled. Production of new tests has been held back by a global shortage of a key component, reagents used to extract RNA from samples. Largely because of complacency at the top, the US was last in line putting its order in.   The same complacency has allowed the institutions that the US now most needs to wither and die. Trump’s third national security adviser, John Bolton, axed the office in the national security council to coordinate a US response to pandemics, which was established after the Ebola outbreak. Bolton, like Trump, did not see it as a real national security issue, like China or Iran. “Who would have thought we would even be having the subject?” Trump wondered aloud, in explanation of why the administration had been taken by surprise. With an eye fixed on the money markets, the president has sought to cover up the real lack of resilience in the system, insisting: “We’re testing everybody that we need to test.”    National guard troops have been deployed to New Rochelle, New York, to tackle the coronavirus. Governor Andrew Cuomo criticised the federal response to the crisis. Photograph: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images  But the truth has quickly become felt around the country, as people with symptoms and risk factors have been denied testing. The CDC director, Robert Redfield, an evangelical conservative with no previous experience in managing a large state agency, revealed how out of touch the administration was with the reality on the ground on Wednesday. When asked by the House oversight committee why the US was not providing drive-through tests, as have been introduced elsewhere – he replied: “We’re trying to maintain the relationship between individuals and their healthcare providers.” Jim Cooper, a Tennessee Democrat pointed out to him that most Americans do not have a regular doctor, and certainly do not see a physician often enough to have a “relationship”. When they get seriously ill, most head for the emergency room of the country’s overstrained hospitals.   The lack of tests means that the country is stumbling blindfolded into the worst health crisis in decades. Despite warnings from his own experts, the president reportedly clings to the relatively low number of confirmed cases as a sign that the US might be spared the worst. When the country is struck by the inevitable wave of sickness and deaths, sweeping aside Trump’s reassurances, it is hard to predict how he will react. We do know he will see it through the prism of his prospects for re-election, and we can be fairly certain he will look for someone to blame along with a distraction, most likely some form of conflict at home or abroad. The scale of the debacle will require a major distraction. Awful as the coronavirus pandemic looks now, Trump’s backlash could be even worse.  \\n\\tThe Donald Trump administration offered “large sums of money” to get exclusive access to a coronavirus vaccine being developed by a German company, Die Welt reported Sunday.\\nAccording\\xa0to the article, Trump was trying to get the Tübingen-based CureVac company — which also has sites in Frankfurt and Boston — to move its research wing to the United States and develop the vaccine “for the U.S. only.”\\nA spokesperson for Germany’s Health Ministry quoted in the article appeared to acknowledge the U.S. approach and said that Berlin was “very interested in ensuring that vaccines and active substances against the new coronavirus are also developed in Germany and Europe.”\\nOn Sunday afternoon, Germany’s Health Ministry told\\xa0Reuters that its spokesperson had been quoted correctly in the newspaper article, confirming that Washington had attempted to take over the biopharmaceutical company.

He didn’t stop by the group’s daily meetings often, but he had an idea he was eager to share: He wanted to start a White House talk radio show. At the time, the virus was rapidly spreading across the country, and Trump would soon announce a ban on European travel. A talk radio show, Trump excitedly explained, would allow him to quell Americans’ fears and answer their questions about the pandemic directly, according to three White House officials who heard the pitch. There would be no screening, he said, just an open line for people to call and engage one-on-one with the president. But that Saturday, almost as suddenly as he proposed it, the president outlined one reason he would not be moving forward with it: He did not want to compete with Rush Limbaugh. No one in the room was sure how to respond, two of the officials said. Someone suggested hosting the show in the mornings or on weekends, to steer clear of the conservative radio host’s schedule. But Trump shook his head, saying he envisioned his show as two hours a day, every day. And were it not for Limbaugh, and the risk of encroaching on his territory, he reiterated, he would do it. One of the officials involved directly in the effort said it wasn’t the first time Trump had discussed hosting a radio show from the White House. But if some in the room were unsure whether the president’s proposal was a joke, they knew his deference to Limbaugh was anything but. When it comes to the president’s favored media figures, most observers tend to fixate on the Fox News lineup of Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity. But several people close to Trump say that in the midst of a pandemic, he has come to keenly appreciate the extent of Limbaugh’s reach, and the fact that his show, perhaps more than any other source, offers a real-time metric of how the president’s decisions are playing with his supporters.    Rush Limbaugh appears with President Donald Trump at a rally in Cape Girardeau, Mo., on Nov. 5, 2018. (Doug Mills / The New York Times)    Now, as multiple voices vie for the president’s ear on the appropriate timeline for America’s path to normalcy, Limbaugh is amplifying Trump’s instinct for swiftness. And for this president, as well as much of his party, Limbaugh’s affirmation remains a powerful motivator. “Talk radio is still a powerhouse when it comes to Republican voters,” said Jason Miller, co-host of the War Room podcast and a former Trump communications adviser. And the president, Miller said, “realizes how big a powerhouse Rush is.” The White House declined to comment on Trump’s desire for a radio show. “The Rush Limbaugh Show” has been the most popular talk-radio show in the country for decades, currently drawing 15.5 million listeners a week. In that time Limbaugh has traded in the kind of deeply divisive messaging that Trump regularly brandishes to appeal to his conservative base. Like the president, Limbaugh has also dispensed disinformation and falsehoods at a rapid clip. In the last few weeks alone he has repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as the “common cold.” His history of anti-gay remarks was revived as recently as February, when he said Americans would not elect Pete Buttigieg after seeing him “kissing his husband onstage, next to Mr. Man, Donald Trump.” (Limbaugh later told listeners that Trump had called him and told him not to apologize for the comments.) Limbaugh is among Trump’s most influential backers, praising him for his politics and leadership well before many other Republicans cast their lot with him. He recently called attacks on the president’s handling of the virus crisis “a political hit job.” The president has returned the favor: In a surprise move during his State of the Union address in February, he awarded Limbaugh, who had recently revealed he had late-stage lung cancer, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor. He highlighted Limbaugh’s charitable work and called him “the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet.” As public health officials urge caution in relaxing stay-at-home restrictions, corporate executives and conservative activists alike are pleading with the president to reopen the economy. Trump has argued that he alone has the power to override stay-at-home orders imposed at the state level — a claim that legal scholars reject and that he appeared to walk back on Tuesday. Still, many Republican governors are looking directly to the White House to set the tone for a path forward. As for his own guidance, Trump’s preferred media sources have tempered their advocacy. After initially dismissing the severity of the virus, many of Trump’s go-to talkers on Fox News, including Hannity, have approached the question with relative delicacy, appearing to take their cues from the president rather than try to proactively urge one path or another. Limbaugh, conversely, has been a forceful voice from the get-go. Along with casting medical experts like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci as “Hillary Clinton sympathizers,” he has used his enormous platform to call for a rapid return to normal life. “Are we just going to sit by and watch $22 trillion — that’s the value, that’s the sum total of the GDP, that’s the U.S. economy — are we just going to sit by here and watch it evaporate?” Limbaugh said in one segment on March 31. “Because that’s what we’re doing, under the guise of not losing any unnecessary life.” On Monday, Limbaugh argued that the “shutdown” was “a political effort to get rid of Donald Trump in the election this November” — as well as a Democratic ploy to “keep people fed without them having to go to work” and to “fine them for going to church.” Limbaugh, a frequent golf partner of Trump’s in Palm Beach, Florida, has been candid and proud about his direct line to the president. During his show on Friday, Limbaugh revealed that the president calls him “once a week just to see how I’m doing” and that sometimes Vice President Mike Pence joins. He added that their conversations were only about his health, not policy. (Attempts to reach Limbaugh through a colleague for this article were unsuccessful.) But in this moment, as Trump grapples with what he has called “the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make,” Limbaugh has an unparalleled perch. “A lot of politicians — obviously conservatives — tune into his show as they’re trying to figure out what their point of view should be,” said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union. Schlapp noted that with most decisions, the president uses various media sources as a way to “think through questions.” And while the president is listening to his public health advisers in this moment, Schlapp said, he’s also adhering to the formulas he knows best. “The school nurse doesn’t run the school,” Schlapp said. “The principal runs the school.” Polling shows that the vast majority of Americans support a national stay-at-home order, but Limbaugh’s audience — in other words, the president’s base — shares his agitation about jump-starting the economy. His recent shows illustrate the extent to which many of Trump’s supporters remain suspicious of the public health experts and other officials who have recommended stay-at-home orders and similar guidelines to slow transmission of the virus. “I agree the right person is in office to bring this country out of this,” said a Las Vegas police officer named Marcus who called into Limbaugh’s show on Monday. “But, you know, when you look at numbers, Rush — the numbers don’t add up as far as, like, you know, the amount of people that die of a normal flu every year and those sort of things. I mean, it’s terrifying how one thing can make us give up our rights so quickly.” On Friday, a caller from Prescott, Arizona, wondered if experts were urging the shutdown of the economy as a way to model the potential effects of legislation intended to combat climate change. “Isn’t this kind of like a dry run of the Green New Deal?” he asked. In the midst of everything, Limbaugh’s listeners unequivocally support the president. On Friday, a New York construction worker named Andy criticized the transformation of Manhattan into a “ghost town,” and said, “There is no better man to be in the White House right now than Donald Trump.” It is the kind of affirmation that helps illuminate radio’s increasing appeal to Trump. Television indeed plays an outsize role in the president’s assessment of himself and his administration. But with no campaign rallies to look forward to, people close to the president say he feels stifled in his inability to communicate directly with his supporters, complaining that the news media tries to distort his message at his daily briefings. The president may have dropped plans for his own talk radio show. But for Trump, what Limbaugh offers is perhaps second best: a taste of the validation he craves, as well as a blueprint for how to make his supporters even happier. “Rush is perfectly confident and competent to play the outsider to the system,” said Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor. “In that way, he and the president learn from each other.”  c.2020 The New York Times Company       Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, adjusts the microphone to speak during a news conference on the coronavirus with President Donald Trump in the Rose Garden at the White House, Friday, March 13, 2020, in Washington.The Associated Press    Public health and national security experts shake their heads when President Donald Trump says the coronavirus “came out of nowhere” and “blindsided the world.” They’ve been warning about the next pandemic for years and criticized the Trump administration’s decision in 2018 to dismantle a National Security Council directorate at the White House charged with preparing for when, not if, another pandemic would hit the nation. “It would be nice if the office was still there,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Health, told Congress this week. “I wouldn’t necessarily characterize it as a mistake (to eliminate the unit). I would say we worked very well with that office.” The NSC directorate for global health and security and bio-defence survived the transition from President Barack Obama to Trump in 2017. Trump’s elimination of the office suggested, along with his proposed budget cuts for the CDC, that he did not see the threat of pandemics in the same way that many experts in the field did. “One year later I was mystified when the White House dissolved the office, leaving the country less prepared for pandemics like COVID-19,” Beth Cameron, the first director of the unit, wrote in an op-ed Friday in The Washington Post. She said the directorate was set up to be the “smoke alarm” and get ahead of emergencies and sound a warning at the earliest sign of fire — “all with the goal of avoiding a six-alarm fire.” It’s impossible to assess the impact of the 2018 decision to disband the unit, she said. Cameron noted that biological experts remain at the White House, but she says it’s clear that eliminating the office contributed to what she called a “sluggish domestic response.” She said that shortly before Trump took office, the unit was watching a rising number of cases in China of a deadly strain of the flu and a yellow fever outbreak in Angola. “It’s unclear whether the decision to disband the directorate, which was made in May 2018, after John Bolton became national security adviser, was a tactical move to downgrade the issue or whether it was part of the White House’s interest in simplifying and shrinking the National Security Council staff,” Cameron says. The NSC during the Obama administration grew to about 250 professionals, according to Trump’s current national security adviser, Robert O’Brien. The staff has been cut to about 110 or 115 staffers, he said. When Trump was asked on Friday whether closing the NSC global health unit slowed the U.S. response, the president called it a “nasty” question because his administration had acted quickly and saved lives. “I don’t know anything about it,” Trump said. Earlier, when asked about it, he said: “This is something that you can never really think is going to happen.” For many years, the national intelligence director’s worldwide threat assessment has warned that a flu pandemic or other large-scale outbreak of a contagious disease could lead to massive rates of death and disability that would severely affect the world economy. Public health experts have been blowing whistles too. Back in mid-2018, Fauci told Congress: “When you have a respiratory virus that can be spread by droplets and aerosol and … there’s a degree of morbidity associated with that, you can have a catastrophe. … The one that we always talk about is the 1918 pandemic, which killed between 50 and 100 million people. … Influenza first, or something like influenza, is the one that keeps me up at night.” The White House says the NSC remains involved in responding to the coronavirus pandemic. A senior administration official said Friday that the NSC’s global health security directorate was absorbed into another division where similar responsibilities still exist, but under different titles. The work of co-ordinating policy and making sure that decisions made by Trump’s coronavirus task force are implemented is still the job of the NSC. Some lawmakers aren’t convinced. Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., and Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, have introduced a bill that would require future administrations to have experts always in place to prepare for new pandemics. “Two years ago, the administration dismantled the apparatus that had been put in place five years before in the face of the Ebola crisis,” Connolly said. “I think, in retrospect, that was an unwise move. This bill would restore that and institutionalize it.” Connolly said the bill is not meant to be critical of the Trump administration. He said it’s a recognition that Trump had to name a coronavirus responder just like Obama had to name one for Ebola in 2014. “We can’t go from pandemic to pandemic,” Connolly said. The House Foreign Affairs Committee on March 4 passed the measure, which is co-sponsored by 37 Democrats and five Republicans. The full House has not yet voted on the bill. Chabot said one of the bill’s main goals is to would require personnel to be permanently in place preparing for pandemics. “Specifically, we need someone, preferable at the NSC, to quarterback the U.S. government’s response since that response inevitably involves several agencies across the government,” Chabot said. “Our bill would make this position permanent.” Former Obama administration officials insist that the Trump White House would have been able to act more quickly had the office still been intact. “I think if we’d had a unit and dedicated professionals looking at this issue, gaming out scenarios well before … we might have identified some of these testing issues,” says Lisa Monaco, President Obama’s homeland security adviser, said at a recent forum on coronavirus. “There would have been folks sounding the alarm in December when we saw this coming out of China, saying ‘Hey, what do we need to be doing here in this country to address it?” Ron Klain, who managed the government response to contain and mitigate the spread of Ebola in 2014, agreed. “If I were back in my old job at the White House … I’d be pushing to have us do 30 million tests — to test people in nursing homes, to test people with unexplained respiratory ailments, to test the people who regularly visit nursing homes, to test health care workers,” Klain said recently at the event hosted by the Center for American Progress in Washington.

Earlier this month, Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and administration and industry leaders met with CureVac’s CEO, Daniel Menichella, to discuss the vaccine.

Above all, the hope is to avoid exclusivity. \"The exclusive sale of a possible vaccine to the USA must be prevented by all means,\" tweeted Karl Lauterbach, a professor of health economics epidemiology and German lawmaker, in response to the report. \"Capitalism has limits.\" There was no immediate comment from the U.S. embassy in Berlin, and CureVac declined to comment, but the company\\'s CEO Daniel Menichella met with Trump, Vice Presidnet Mike Pence, and other members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force earlier this month.

He was asked by a reporter about the federal failures to test for the novel coronavirus. He blamed \"rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time\" for any shortfalls.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Trump says \"I don\\'t take responsibility at all\" when asked about the delay in coronavirus tests\\n \\n  \\n 08:14 PM - 13 Mar 2020\\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMedical experts, such as Boston University\\'s Sandro Galea, have called the federal response a \"fiasco.\" Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who stood behind Trump at the White House, acknowledged on Thursday that federal testing efforts had failed, leaving everyone, including public health experts, ignorant of the outbreak\\'s true toll nationwide. \"The federal government has consistently underestimated the need for urgency around testing for this virus,\" Galea told BuzzFeed News.\\n \\n \\n \\nLater in the press conference, when Trump was asked if he takes any responsibility for his administration disbanding the White House\\'s pandemic office, the president responded by calling the question \"nasty.\" He also absolved himself of any responsibility, saying, \"When you say me, I didn\\'t do it. ... I don\\'t know anything about it.\"\\n \\n \\n \\nAcross the country this week, public events, including pro sports, have been canceled and schools have temporarily closed.

A CDC test for the virus approved in early February turned out to be unreliable. Federal authorities only allowed other state and private labs to start providing tests at the end of February. In his remarks on Friday, Trump also disparaged the Obama administration\\'s response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Outside observers noted that the Obama administration had declared a national emergency over that outbreak when it stood at only 20 cases, and that within a month of the pandemic it had performed 1 million tests for the flu bug.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n I covered the response to the 2009 swine flu epidemic.

Trump said during a Saturday news conference that he did not intend to fire Powell, but that he was \"not happy with the Fed\"\\xa0and its response to market turmoil. The Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst week since October 2008, ending with a 12 percent drop and erasing the majority of its gains from 2019. \"I have the right to do that or the right to remove him as chairman,\"\\xa0Trump told reporters. \"He has, so far, made a lot of bad decisions, in my opinion.\" It\\'s a familiar threat from the president, who has frequently tried to pressure policymakers to drop interest rates to zero, or even send them into negative territory. But to do so as the coronavirus, which causes a disease known as COVID-19, rattles the global economy was particularly striking.    Trump speaks during a news conference about the coronavirus in the James Brady Briefing Room at the White House, Saturday. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)  \"If he removed Jerome Powell, it would be hugely destabilizing to markets,\"\\xa0Ernie Tedeschi, a policy economist at Evercore ISI in Washington, told The New York Times. \"The market trusts Jerome Powell to do what monetary policy can do. Jerome Powell gets it.\"   CAN TRUMP LEGALLY FIRE JEROME POWELL AS FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN?   A Fed chair has never been removed by a president, and Trump\\'s attacks on Powell, whose term expires in 2022, are mostly unprecedented. Under the Federal Reserve Act, which was signed into law in 1913, the president has the power to appoint seven members to the Fed\\'s board of governors, with the approval of the Senate. It doesn\\'t explicitly give the president the power to remove Fed members, but indicates it could be possible. \"The President shall fix the term of the successor to such member at not to exceed fourteen years, as designated by the President at the time of nomination,\"\\xa0Section 10 of the act reads, adding: \"Thereafter each member shall hold office for a term of fourteen years from the expiration of the term of his predecessor, unless sooner removed for cause by the President.\"   TRUMP DECLARES NATIONAL EMERGENCY IN RESPONSE TO CORONAVIRUS CRISIS   Earlier this month, Powell announced an emergency 50-basis-point cut to the benchmark federal funds rate, sending it to a range of just 1 percent to 1.25 percent. It marked the first time since the financial crisis that the Fed has reduced its key rate outside of scheduled policy-setting meetings. Policymakers are scheduled to hold their two-day meeting this week, during which they\\'re widely expected to slash rates to 0 percent to 0.25 percent.   GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE     The Trump Organization paid bribes, through middlemen, to New York City tax assessors to lower its property tax bills for several Manhattan buildings in the 1980s and 1990s, according to five former tax assessors and city employees as well as a former Trump Organization employee.\\nTwo of the five city employees said they personally took bribes to lower the assessment on a Trump property; the other three said they had indirect knowledge of the payments.\\nThe city employees were among 18 indicted in 2002 for taking bribes in exchange for lowering the valuations of properties, which in turn reduced the taxes owed for the buildings. All of the 18 eventually pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Manhattan except for one, who died before his case was resolved.\\nNo building owners were charged, though the addresses of some of the properties involved became public. Trump Organization buildings were not on that list. No evidence has emerged that Donald Trump personally knew of or participated in the alleged bribery.\\nTrump denied any wrongdoing at the time, and the Trump Organization reiterated that position in response to questions for this article. “To be clear, at no time did the Trump Organization or any of its employees or principals ever pay anyone for the purpose of unlawfully obtaining a lower tax valuation,” Alan Garten, the Trump Organization’s chief legal officer, wrote in a statement. “This was corroborated by multiple investigations which found no evidence of any wrongdoing by the company or any of its principals. … If anything, the Trump Organization was a victim of the scandal.”\\nAsked to provide evidence or name the agencies that allegedly cleared the company, Garten did not provide additional details, saying, “I was referring to the different investigations conducted by the state and federal authorities at the time.” (Here is the company’s full statement.)\\nThe moment that corrupt assessors told their co-conspirators that the Trump Organization had agreed to pay bribes was memorable, said Frank Valvo, a former city assessor who served a year and a half in prison for his role in the scheme.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tEditor’s picks\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\nThe excitement was palpable in the office, Valvo recalled, as one of the assessors broached the news. “He says, ‘We got Trump!’” Valvo recalled. “Wow. Holy Smokes.”\\nTwo former city employees, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told ProPublica and WNYC that they accepted money from middlemen representing the Trump Organization to lower assessments on 40 Wall St. after Trump took over the skyscraper in 1995.\\nThe assessors’ scandal burst into the news just months after the Sept. 11 attacks, revealing deep-seated corruption in the city’s sprawling bureaucracy with potential fallout for some of Manhattan’s wealthiest landholders. A joint city and federal investigation found that the assessors took more than $10 million in bribes over 35 years and changed the assessed value of at least 562 properties.\\nValvo told ProPublica and WNYC, “I’m guilty of what I did. I’m not going to hide that.” He said he’s speaking because he’s now 88, and he “wants the truth to come out” about the property owners. (To hear more from Valvo, listen to this week’s episode of “Trump, Inc.”\\nThe two employees of the assessors office who said they personally received bribes for Trump properties said they met with middlemen, or bag men, for various property owners, who would hand them envelopes of cash. In exchange, the city employees treated the middleman’s clients favorably when calculating the buildings’ tax assessments. One such middleman, they said, was a tax consultant, Thomas McArdle, whose name later surfaced in connection with the bribery scheme.\\nOne of the two assessors recalled receiving a list of about 20 properties from McArdle; 40 Wall St. was on it, he said.\\nAnother said that at one meeting, he looked in the envelope and asked for more money. The middleman responded by telling him that Donald Trump thought the employee should be making the assessment changes for free.\\nApart from the two employees who say they took bribes, and Valvo, a fourth former assessor said he could confirm that Trump Organization property was involved but declined to provide additional details. A fifth former assessor said he remembers Trump Organization properties being talked about in the office as among those whose assessments were lowered in exchange for bribes.\\nAnother convicted assessor, Joe Iovino, said he “did not know of any Trump Properties” paying bribes. The remaining living assessors either declined to comment or did not respond to multiple requests for interviews.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tRelated\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\nThe former Trump Organization employee said that when he worked at the company, Donald Trump arranged for an employee to meet with McArdle, the alleged middleman. (The extent of Trump’s knowledge, if any, as to the ultimate purpose of this alleged meeting is unknown.)\\nDuring the subsequent alleged meeting, which Trump did not attend, McArdle received a check, and the employee passed along what the former employee said he knew to be “bogus information” to McArdle. The false information was intended to be passed on to the assessors, according to the former employee, to give them a pretext to lower the tax valuation for the Plaza Hotel, which the Trump Organization then owned.\\nMcArdle, who was a cooperating witness in the bribery case, died in 2013 and was never charged. When the scandal erupted, according to the former Trump Organization employee, Trump expressed concern that he had signed checks payable to McArdle. His staff told him not to worry because executives of the Plaza had signed the checks, the employee said.\\nOn Tuesday evening, the Trump Organization’s Garten sent an email stating, “We reviewed our accounting records and we have no record of any payment ever being made to Tom McArdle.”\\nProPublica asked whether the records search included those from the Plaza Hotel, as well as whether the records indicated if the company had paid McArdle’s firm rather than McArdle personally. Garten replied, “Regarding Trump Plaza, as I said, we have no records of any payments to Mr. McArdle.”\\nHistorical tax assessment data for the Plaza shows its valuation dropping noticeably during the Trump Organization’s seven-year ownership. But it’s hard to discern whether the changes in valuation were due to any assessors’ scheme or changes in market conditions — or both. The Plaza’s valuation dropped by about 40% over two years, for example, but that also coincided with the hotel’s 1992 entry into bankruptcy. The assessments began rising again on its 1994 tax bill, when the hotel was back on the market. It sold in 1995.\\nIn the case of 40 Wall St., the assessment also dropped. The decrease actually began before Trump took control of the building, which was then in distress, after he retroactively appealed the tax bill for what the Trump Organization said were fully legitimate reasons. The valuation stayed low, then climbed markedly beginning in 2000 — the same year the investigation into the bribery scheme began gaining traction.\\nThe Trump Organization, in its statement for this article, attributed the Plaza’s rise to fluctuations in the city’s economy at the time. At 40 Wall St., the rise in valuations in the 2000s occurred after the building was renovated and signed a slew of new deep-pocketed tenants, which would be expected to drive up the assessment.\\nIn 2007, Trump was questioned under oath about McArdle in an unrelated deposition for a lawsuit he filed against journalist Timothy O’Brien. Here’s the full exchange between a lawyer for O’Brien and Trump, according to a transcript of the deposition:\\n\\nQ. Ever heard the name McCardle?\\nA. No. Who is McCardle?\\nQ. Thomas McCardle.\\nA. It sounds vaguely familiar, but I don’t remember.\\nQ. Former New York City tax assessor’s office, then tax consultant?\\nA. I don’t know the name.\\nQ. Was caught up in a scandal in the early 2000s regarding tax assessors?\\nA. I think he is a man that represented many, many real estate people in New York. He represented some of the biggest real estate companies in New York. I don’t know if he represented us or not, but I don’t remember that.\\nQ. Did you ever make any payments to Mr. McCardle?\\nA. I don’t even remember ever — I don’t even know that name. I think I read the name because there was some kind of tax scandal going on, and he was involved with various real estate people. I don’t know the name. I don’t know that we ever used him.\\nQ. Do you recall —\\nA. He was a consultant of some kind.\\nQ. Yeah.\\nA. No, I don’t remember ever having used him. But he was used by many major real estate companies in New York.\\n\\nProsecutors never pursued property owners over the bribes. One of the alleged architects of the scheme, an 85-year-old former assessor named Albert Schussler, who had become a middleman between assessors and owners, had a fatal stroke the night before he was scheduled to talk to prosecutors. His death hampered the case against owners, lawyers said.\\n“You’d love to follow the rainbow to the very end and get every person along the way who has been committing crimes, but unfortunately it’s not possible,” said Sharon McCarthy, the assistant U.S. attorney who led the prosecution of the case, in an interview with academic researchers in 2014. “The person who dealt directly with the property owners is Albert Schussler, and he passed away, so we lost the ability to go after anyone else.”\\nMcCarthy told ProPublica and WNYC that she could not discuss any part of the case that isn’t in the public record.\\nAfter the devastation wrought in lower Manhattan by the 9/11 attack, fighting terrorism became the urgent focus. City Hall, worried about lower Manhattan, tried to prop up developers.\\nThe federal and state statutes of limitations for bribery have expired, so no property owners face any risk of prosecution.\\nAfter the indictments, two Trump entities sued New York City, claiming that he had not paid bribes to lower assessments and thus the Trump World Tower near the United Nations was unfairly valued by assessors higher than it should have been.\\nWhen Trump filed the suit, he was quoted in The New York Times saying, “It is impossible for any one of those property owners who used Schussler not to have known what was going on.”\\nThe entity that owned the Trump World Tower separately sued the city seeking a tax break for creating affordable housing, and the city ultimately settled both suits together. Trump’s company received a tax break worth more than $100 million. The 13-page agreement did not mention or address the merits of Trump’s claims that the Trump World Tower suffered because of Trump’s asserted unwillingness to pay any bribes.\\nThe assessors each pleaded guilty and most of them served between one to three years in prison. The Finance Department said that they had deprived the city of $160 million in tax revenue over the four years prior to the indictments and millions more in the decades before that.

His response could serve as the slogan for his administration, Edward Keenan writes.    Edward KeenanWashington Bureau Chief Fri., March 13, 20205 min. read Article was updated Mar. 14, 2020    WASHINGTON, DC—In the White House Rose Garden Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump was asked if he was at fault for the slow availability of testing for the COVID-19 coronavirus. His response could serve as the slogan for his administration.  “I don’t take responsibility at all.”  President Harry Truman famously had a sign on his desk that said, “The buck stops here.” Gen. Dwight Eisenhower prepared a statement in the event D-Day failed, saying “If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone.” Past presidents considered it a point of pride, and a principle of leadership, to accept responsibility for what happens under their command.  That’s not Trump. He assigns blame, and he accepts — demands — credit. Impeachment, the government shutdown, stock market performance, in virtually every respect it’s always been the case. And it is the case with the coronavirus, right through the weird press conference in which he declared a national emergency Friday.  For the delays in testing, he essentially blamed the Obama administration, saying the system he’d inherited wasn’t equipped for the level of testing needed. For the lack of an agreement on emergency relief measures that were being voted on Friday in congress, he blamed the Democrats for “not giving enough.” In response to a question about why he had shut down the pandemic office in the National Security Council that had been set up by Obama, he blamed the reporter for asking a “nasty question,” then denied he’d done it: “I don’t know anything about it,” he said. In his address to the nation less than 48 hours ago from the Oval Office, he’d blamed China and Europe for the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. Credit, he was willing to accept. He heaped praise on himself for the wisdom of restricting travel from China and Europe. And then a series of his appointees came to the microphone to congratulate him for his leadership and foresight in allowing the measures they were announcing. Measures, in many cases, he was publicly saying days or weeks ago were unnecessary.  “This day should be an inspiration to every American. Because thanks to your leadership, we’ve not only created an all-of-government response, we’ve created an all-of-America response,” Vice-President Mike Pence said to Trump, emphasizing the president’s leadership rather than any information that might help the general public understand what that leadership had brought about. “Throughout this process Mr. President, you’ve put the health of America first.”  A note about that all-of-America response: Pence was most directly talking about the corporate leaders who stood beside and around him. They were there to talk about what their companies were doing to pitch in during this time of crisis, an apparent branding opportunity. Google was helping develop a website to establish a testing protocol; Walmart and CVS were making parts of their parking lots available for testing; Roche diagnostics was creating the testing kits — of which Trump said 5 million would be available within a month. “I don’t think we’re going to need that many,” Trump added.  The leaders of each of these companies got to come to the podium in turn and say a few words advertising their corporate contribution. In David Foster Wallace’s novel Infinite Jest the years bear the names of corporations; in Donald Trump’s America, this national emergency was brought to you by Signet Health, the nation’s largest provider of house calls.  Many of those leaders shook hands with the president afterwards, hardly models of the social distancing public health experts recommend. Canada came up, too: Trump said he and Trudeau had talked on the phone yesterday. “We didn’t discuss the border,” he said. “At the time his wife had not been diagnosed yet. She’s a lovely lady, wonderful lady, great lady,” Trump said of Sophie Grégoire Trudeau’s infection with the coronavirus. “I was a little surprised. We did discuss it prior to. She’s going to be fine, but he thought she was most likely not going to have the virus. She does. But we didn’t discuss the border.”  All of that overshadowed the purported — and welcome — purpose of the press conference: to announce the state of emergency and the $50 billion in funding: to put hospitals on disaster footing and relax rules to allow them to free up beds, change admissions requirements, and license out of state doctors quickly. To give powers to the Health and Human Services Department to modify insurance regulations. To unveil the introduction of rapid testing deployment, soon to be available to Americans in drive-through stations across the country. And to announce a new website to help people determine if they needed a test, and help them get one performed.  This was the type of public-health announcement many would have welcomed in the Oval Office address Wednesday night, when instead Trump stuck mostly to blame for the “foreign virus,” and announced economic measures meant to address the plunging stock market.  In any event, late in coming as it may be, and as clouded in branding for both Trump and corporate partners, the state of emergency announcement may have accomplished what Trump’s previous address could not. As it was happening, the stock market rallied, rising almost 10 per cent on major indexes and regaining most of yesterday’s historic losses.  Part of what was needed to alleviate the fears of investors was always the same as what was needed to address the concerns of ordinary people: a concrete approach to actually helping manage the disease. Soon, everyone will know if this administration can follow through. It is supposed to launch a new website Sunday and mass deploy tests by next week. Soon everyone will see if the “large number” of respirators Trump claimed to have ordered is enough; if the hospital preparation measures he announced are effective; and if they arrive on time.  That these come a day after sports leagues, Broadway theatres and concert promoters and state and local governments acted independently of Trump’s administration to shut down much of society. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases head Anthony Fauci said it’s impossible to know at this point how effective those measures will be in heading off a dreaded high peak in the infection and fatality rate.  Perhaps together, the closures and emergency measures will help make the crisis less severe. If they do, you can be certain Trump will take credit — he already has. But if it turns out to be too little, too late, he’s already said he accepts no responsibility.

President Moon Jae-in offered to send the equipment if his country has any spare, his Blue House office said in a statement late on Tuesday. The offer apparently followed a 23-minute phone call, which it said was arranged at Mr Trump’s urgent request. The request highlights the very different reactions to Covid-19 the two nations have taken since both discovered their first coronavirus cases on the same day. South Korea rolled out widespread testing within days, launching an aggressive programme to isolate confirmed cases and trace their contacts. Following a significant early outbreak it has won praise for slowing the spread of the disease. So far it has reported 125 deaths, compared to more than 500 in the United States. The number of new infections per day has been below 100 for 13 consecutive days. In contrast, the US did little testing initially, and has now been shutting parts of the country en masse, with fast-growing outbreaks in a number of states and thousands of new cases per day. Mr Trump sought for weeks to play down the threat of the coronavirus, insisting at one point that the 15 confirmed cases in the US would soon be “close to zero”, and saying it would disappear like a “miracle”.  Trump calls for protection of Asian Americans after his use of \\'Chinese virus\\' blamed for rise in racism  The revelation that he has apparently asked for help from a foreign country comes against the background of increased calls within the United States for the president to activate the Defense Production Act, which would allow him to force private companies to join the fight against Covid-19 by repurposing their output towards urgent products like hand sanitiser and face masks. Mr Trump says he has no need to force companies to make medical supplies because so many have volunteered.

When, in January 2016, I wrote that despite being a lifelong Republican who worked in the previous three GOP administrations, I would never vote for Donald Trump, even though his administration would align much more with my policy views than a Hillary Clinton presidency would, a lot of my Republican friends were befuddled. How could I not vote for a person who checked far more of my policy boxes than his opponent? What I explained then, and what I have said many times since, is that Trump is fundamentally unfit—intellectually, morally, temperamentally, and psychologically—for office. For me, that is the paramount consideration in electing a president, in part because at some point it’s reasonable to expect that a president will face an unexpected crisis—and at that point, the president’s judgment and discernment, his character and leadership ability, will really matter.  David Frum: The worst outcome  “Mr. Trump has no desire to acquaint himself with most issues, let alone master them” is how I put it four years ago. “No major presidential candidate has ever been quite as disdainful of knowledge, as indifferent to facts, as untroubled by his benightedness.” I added this:   Mr. Trump’s virulent combination of ignorance, emotional instability, demagogy, solipsism and vindictiveness would do more than result in a failed presidency; it could very well lead to national catastrophe. The prospect of Donald Trump as commander in chief should send a chill down the spine of every American.   It took until the second half of Trump’s first term, but the crisis has arrived in the form of the coronavirus pandemic, and it’s hard to name a president who has been as overwhelmed by a crisis as the coronavirus has overwhelmed Donald Trump. To be sure, the president isn’t responsible for either the coronavirus or the disease it causes, COVID-19, and he couldn’t have stopped it from hitting our shores even if he had done everything right. Nor is it the case that the president hasn’t done anything right; in fact, his decision to implement a travel ban on China was prudent. And any narrative that attempts to pin all of the blame on Trump for the coronavirus is simply unfair. The temptation among the president’s critics to use the pandemic to get back at Trump for every bad thing he’s done should be resisted, and schadenfreude is never a good look. That said, the president and his administration are responsible for grave, costly errors, most especially the epic manufacturing failures in diagnostic testing, the decision to test too few people, the delay in expanding testing to labs outside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and problems in the supply chain. These mistakes have left us blind and badly behind the curve, and, for a few crucial weeks, they created a false sense of security. What we now know is that the coronavirus silently spread for several weeks, without us being aware of it and while we were doing nothing to stop it. Containment and mitigation efforts could have significantly slowed its spread at an early, critical point, but we frittered away that opportunity. “They’ve simply lost time they can’t make up. You can’t get back six weeks of blindness,” Jeremy Konyndyk, who helped oversee the international response to Ebola during the Obama administration and is a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, told The Washington Post . “To the extent that there’s someone to blame here, the blame is on poor, chaotic management from the White House and failure to acknowledge the big picture.”  Ben Rhodes: How Trump designed his White House to fail  Earlier this week, Anthony Fauci, the widely respected director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases whose reputation for honesty and integrity has been only enhanced during this crisis, admitted in congressional testimony that the United States is still not providing adequate testing for the coronavirus. “It is failing. Let’s admit it.” He added, “The idea of anybody getting [testing] easily, the way people in other countries are doing it, we’re not set up for that. I think it should be, but we’re not.\" We also know the World Health Organization had working tests that the United States refused, and researchers at a project in Seattle tried to conduct early tests for the coronavirus but were prevented from doing so by federal officials. (Doctors at the research project eventually decided to perform coronavirus tests without federal approval.) But that’s not all. The president reportedly ignored early warnings of the severity of the virus and grew angry at a CDC official who in February warned that an outbreak was inevitable. The Trump administration dismantled the National Security Council’s global-health office, whose purpose was to address global pandemics; we’re now paying the price for that. “We worked very well with that office,” Fauci told Congress. “It would be nice if the office was still there.” We may face a shortage of ventilators and medical supplies, and hospitals may soon be overwhelmed, certainly if the number of coronavirus cases increases at a rate anything like that in countries such as Italy. (This would cause not only needless coronavirus-related deaths, but deaths from those suffering from other ailments who won’t have ready access to hospital care.)  Yascha Mounk: The extraordinary decisions facing Italian doctors  Some of these mistakes are less serious and more understandable than others. One has to take into account that in government, when people are forced to make important decisions based on incomplete information in a compressed period of time, things go wrong. Yet in some respects, the avalanche of false information from the president has been most alarming of all. It’s been one rock slide after another, the likes of which we have never seen. Day after day after day he brazenly denied reality, in an effort to blunt the economic and political harm he faced. But Trump is in the process of discovering that he can’t spin or tweet his way out of a pandemic. There is no one who can do to the coronavirus what Attorney General William Barr did to the Mueller report: lie about it and get away with it. The president’s misinformation and mendacity about the coronavirus are head-snapping. He claimed that it was contained in America when it was actually spreading. He claimed that we had “shut it down” when we had not. He claimed that testing was available when it wasn’t. He claimed that the coronavirus will one day disappear “like a miracle”; it won’t. He claimed that a vaccine would be available in months; Fauci says it will not be available for a year or more. Trump falsely blamed the Obama administration for impeding coronavirus testing. He stated that the coronavirus first hit the United States later than it actually did. (He said that it was three weeks prior to the point at which he spoke; the actual figure was twice that.) The president claimed that the number of cases in Italy was getting “much better” when it was getting much worse. And in one of the more stunning statements an American president has ever made, Trump admitted that his preference was to keep a cruise ship off the California coast rather than allowing it to dock, because he wanted to keep the number of reported cases of the coronavirus artificially low. “I like the numbers,” Trump said. “I would rather have the numbers stay where they are. But if they want to take them off, they’ll take them off. But if that happens, all of a sudden your 240 [cases] is obviously going to be a much higher number, and probably the 11 [deaths] will be a higher number too.” (Cooler heads prevailed, and over the president’s objections, the Grand Princess was allowed to dock at the Port of Oakland.) On and on it goes. To make matters worse, the president delivered an Oval Office address that was meant to reassure the nation and the markets but instead shook both. The president’s delivery was awkward and stilted; worse, at several points, the president, who decided to ad-lib the teleprompter speech, misstated his administration’s own policies, which the administration had to correct. Stock futures plunged even as the president was still delivering his speech. In his address, the president called for Americans to “unify together as one nation and one family,” despite having referred to Washington Governor Jay Inslee as a “snake” days before the speech and attacking Democrats the morning after it. As The Washington Post’s Dan Balz put it, “Almost everything that could have gone wrong with the speech did go wrong.”  Read: You’re likely to get the coronavirus  Taken together, this is a massive failure in leadership that stems from a massive defect in character. Trump is such a habitual liar that he is incapable of being honest, even when being honest would serve his interests. He is so impulsive, shortsighted, and undisciplined that he is unable to plan or even think beyond the moment. He is such a divisive and polarizing figure that he long ago lost the ability to unite the nation under any circumstances and for any cause. And he is so narcissistic and unreflective that he is completely incapable of learning from his mistakes. The president’s disordered personality makes him as ill-equipped to deal with a crisis as any president has ever been. With few exceptions, what Trump has said is not just useless; it is downright injurious. The nation is recognizing this, treating him as a bystander “as school superintendents, sports commissioners, college presidents, governors and business owners across the country take it upon themselves to shut down much of American life without clear guidance from the president,” in the words of Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman of The New York Times. Donald Trump is shrinking before our eyes. The coronavirus is quite likely to be the Trump presidency’s inflection point, when everything changed, when the bluster and ignorance and shallowness of America’s 45th president became undeniable, an empirical reality, as indisputable as the laws of science or a mathematical equation. It has taken a good deal longer than it should have, but Americans have now seen the con man behind the curtain. The president, enraged for having been unmasked, will become more desperate, more embittered, more unhinged. He knows nothing will be the same. His administration may stagger on, but it will be only a hollow shell.

The German Health Ministry has confirmed the report.\\n The episode illustrates a few things about the president’s unfitness to manage the present crisis. First, it shows his inability to grasp positive sum outcomes, especially between countries. A vaccine is a reductio ad absurdum of his dog-eat-dog worldview.

Successful vaccines are always shared around the world because the entire world has a shared interest in eradicating diseases.

Trump had taken the test Friday to determine whether he has the virus and said it would take a \"day or two\" for the results to come back from the lab. \"One week after having dinner with the Brazilian delegation in Mar-a-Lago, the President remains symptom free,” his physician, Sean P. Conley, said in a statement. Trump, who has continued to shake hands with people, including during his announcement Friday at the White House that he was declaring a national emergency, despite the CDC\\'s recommendation to limit physical contact, told reporters that \"it almost becomes a habit.\"   Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak   The White House also announced that they would expand the European travel ban to include the United Kingdom and Ireland beginning midnight on Monday. \"Again, Americans in the U.K. or Ireland can come home,\" Vice President Mike Pence said Saturday. \"Legal residents can come home.\" Trump had initially said during his Oval Office address on Monday night that Ireland and the U.K. were exempt from the ban, although it was unclear why the exception was made because the virus is also present in Britain. The White House also suggested that domestic travel restrictions could be a possibility. On Friday, the Department of Defense announced they were halting domestic travel for all service members, civilian employees and their families in an effort to combat the coronavirus. “We’re considering a broad range of measures,” Pence said when asked about the possibility of domestic travel restrictions. Trump had been repeatedly criticized for refusing to get tested for the virus after it was reported that he was in close contact with multiple people at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida who had tested positive for the coronavirus. Trump\\'s announcement that he had gotten tested appears to be in contrast to a Friday memo from Sean P. Conley, physician to the president, stating that Trump did not need to be tested because the interactions he had with known patients were \"low risk.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended testing for people who have had \"close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19\" or have experienced \"potential exposure through attendance at events or spending time in specific settings where COVID-19 cases have been reported.\" When asked by reporters Saturday to explain the discrepancy between Trump\\'s announcement and the White House physician\\'s memo, Pence said he would \"speak immediately after this press conference with the White House physicians office,\" but did not provide a direct answer. Pence said that he and his wife did not have any symptoms, but were \"more than happy to be tested.” During his remarks Saturday, Trump said he had his temperature taken before entering into the press briefing room. “I had my temperature taken coming into the room,” Trump said. “We are all looking good,\" he said, later adding that his temperature was \"totally normal.\"    Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak    Prior to the briefing, a member of the White House Physician’s Office took temperatures of every member of the press corps in attendance. “Out of an abundance of caution, temperature checks are now being performed on any individuals who are in close contact with the President and Vice President,” said White House spokesperson Judd Deere. A member of the press was turned away from the press conference after registering a 99.9 degrees Fahrenheit temperature. The House of Representatives passed a coronavirus aid package early Saturday morning in a bipartisan vote that includes free testing, paid emergency leave and other resources intended to help stem the crisis and stabilize financial markets. The Senate is expected to vote on the aid package early next week.        Lauren Egan    Lauren Egan is a White House reporter for NBC News based in Washington.  \\n  \\n Washington\\n CNN\\n \\xa0—\\xa0\\n \\n\\n \\n It’s a refrain President Donald Trump repeats whenever he encounters a cough, a sneeze or a sniffle.\\n \\n \\n “I can’t get sick. I can’t get sick,” the President insists when he wants to justify dismissing from the room an underling who might infect him with a bug, according to people who have heard him say it. Experienced aides have encouraged others not to take it personally. \\n \\n \\n In some ways, Trump has been unwittingly preparing his staff for years to prevent the spread of coronavirus. He is a self-described germaphobe who is known to glare at aides who sneeze in his vicinity or try to shake hands with him after coughing. Before becoming president, he once wrote the practice of shaking hands was “barbaric,” though it’s one political tradition even he’s been unable to banish.\\n \\n \\n In the age of coronavirus, the White House is the hub for the federal response – its secure Situation Room used to convene meetings of the President’s task force and the once-underused Briefing Room suddenly sprung into service for daily updates from officials.\\n \\n \\n But the complex is also a workplace where more than a thousand employees, some stuffed into tight workspaces, work for a boss infamous for a fear of germs and a disgust of illness. At least once a week, the operation travels en masse with the President on political or official trips aboard a fleet of aircraft led by Air Force One. Teleworking, while encouraged at some federal agencies, is rare.\\n \\n \\n \\n And like other workplaces across the country, White House officials are beginning to brace for the possibility – some say the eventuality – that coronavirus strikes.\\n \\n \\n The President has sought to impart some of his anti-germ tendencies.\\n \\n \\n “When somebody sneezes – I mean, I try and bail out as much as possible when they’re sneezing,” Trump said last week during a briefing on the coronavirus, using his own aversion to potential maladies as an example for Americans trying to avoid getting sick.\\n \\n \\n Since then, Trump has seemed to adopt a more sober tone when discussing the coronavirus outbreak, which has now spread to 118 people in the United States, including nine deaths.\\n \\n \\n In recent days, advisers close to the President urged him to stop downplaying the outbreak, warning it could hurt him in the long run if the number of cases continues to skyrocket. Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, had been one official who had encouraged the President to tamp down alarm in hopes of stabilizing the markets.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Inside the West Wing, the political ramifications of the coronavirus outbreak have become more apparent as the stock market convulses and the number of American deaths rise. But even as they confront the national crisis, staffers are taking their own precautions to avoid getting sick.\\n \\n \\n Staffers recently received advisories about the coronavirus epidemic that focused on prevention and guidelines for what to do if experiencing coronavirus symptoms. The information distributed to staff included a one-pager from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reminding people to wash their hands, stay home if they are sick and informing people of the coronavirus symptoms, similar to information health officials have publicly distributed or discussed.\\n \\n \\n One official said staffers have appeared more attuned to their health amid the outbreak, wiping down desks with anti-bacterial wipes and being more careful about sneezing into a tissue or arm. \\n \\n \\n But aides have not received any formal guidance on workplace procedures if the virus escalates further, like lawmakers on Capitol Hill recently received, according to officials.\\n \\n \\n The White House declined to identify any specific contingencies related to coronavirus and wouldn’t say what steps are being taken to prevent Trump or Vice President Mike Pence – who is leading the administration’s response efforts – from contracting the disease. Trump has received a yearly flu shot, but vaccines for coronavirus are still more than a year away, health experts have said.\\n \\n \\n Last week, Pence shook hands in Florida with students at a military academy whose classmate was later quarantined because his mother had been in contact with someone who had coronavirus. The vice president’s office said Pence never encountered the student in question. But the episode reflected the potential for transmission as top administration officials continue their travel around the country.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Publicly, Trump has shrugged off suggestions he alter his routine to avoid exposure to COVID-19.\\n \\n \\n “We lead a life. I get around,” Trump told reporters over the weekend when asked whether he was taking any special precautions to avoid coming into contact with the virus. “I think we’re going to be in very good shape.”\\n \\n \\n Officials said they had not noticed any changes in the ways Trump interacts with people he meets at the White House or on his trips around the country. Already, Trump was highly attuned to avoiding sick individuals and whatever germs they might be conveying.\\n \\n \\n Trump himself played a role in personally removing his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney from his two-day trip to India last week because Mulvaney had a cold. According to one person close to Mulvaney, White House doctors advised against having him travel in such close proximity to the President and the first lady, but Trump was also uncomfortable being in such close proximity with someone who was ill.\\n \\n \\n Mulvaney was subject to an on-camera scolding last year when Trump admonished him for coughing in the Oval Office as he was taping an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News.\\n \\n \\n “I don’t like that, you know, I don’t like that,” Trump said. “If you’re going to cough, please leave the room. You just can’t, you just can’t cough.”\\n \\n \\n Trump’s aides have learned to keep sanitizing gel and wipes nearby when the President is on the road. In October 2018, an image of the President climbing the stairs to Air Force One went viral because he appeared to have a piece of white toilet paper stuck to his shoe. An aide later clarified it was the anti-bacterial wipe the President uses after he shakes hands and greets supporters on the rope line at airports.\\n \\n \\n For now, Trump has decided not to forgo political rallies, which can bring tens of thousands of his supporters into tightly packed arenas. He told reporters on Monday the events remain “very safe” for both him and his potential Democratic rivals to host, even as other large gatherings like conferences and summits in the United States are scrapped.\\n \\n \\n On Tuesday, Trump said he was “hearing more and more” about potential risks related to coronavirus at his rallies, but said he wasn’t considering a pause in his politicking.\\n \\n \\n “I don’t think it would be necessary,” he said.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n The President’s reelection campaign has followed Democratic candidates across the country as their primary season is underway. Right now, two aides said there are no plans for Trump to cancel any of his rallies because of the coronavirus, and several are currently in the works. \\n \\n \\n Trump traveled Monday to the 9,605-capacity Bojangles’ Coliseum in Charlotte to host a rally ahead of North Carolina’s Super Tuesday primary. “We’ve got to all work together on this one to safeguard our people. We’re going to safeguard our people,” he told a packed-in crowd.\\n \\n \\n Before taking the stage, the President took pictures with VIP supporters backstage, as he often does before rallies, offering a handshake and a few moments of up-close chit-chat. When Trump participates in photo-lines, an aide is usually nearby with a bottle of hand sanitizer to squirt into his palm whenever he requests it.\\n \\n \\n While other major American companies, like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and CNN parent company Warner Media, have announced restrictions on employee travel, the White House hasn’t taken those steps yet. On Friday, Trump is scheduled to visit tornado damage in Tennessee and the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, where he will undoubtedly encounter hands to shake.\\n \\n \\n He is scheduled to speak at a public health conference in Orlando on Monday and will travel to the Republican Jewish Coalition conference next weekend in Las Vegas.\\n \\n \\n A summit of Southeast Asian leaders had been scheduled to coincide with the Las Vegas trip but that was canceled amid coronavirus fears. And the White House has not announced any overseas travel for the President for the next few months.\\n \\n \\n At least one of Trump’s foreign counterparts – German Chancellor Angela Merkel – seemed momentarily caught off guard Tuesday when a government official refused her handshake during a cabinet meeting.\\n \\n \\n Ending handshakes is likely a development Trump would welcome.\\n \\n \\n “One of the curses of American society is the simple act of shaking hands, and the more successful and famous one becomes the worse this terrible custom seems to get,” he wrote in his 1997 book, “The Art of the Comeback.”\\n \\n  \\n  President Donald Trump reportedly tried to poach German scientists working on a coronavirus vaccine so he could secure exclusive rights to it for the US. The newspaper Welt am Sonntag reported that the Trump administration had offered large sums of cash to Germany-based biotech company CureVac to secure rights for the vaccine work, \"but only for the USA.\" The German government is battling back, offering financial incentives to the company to remain in Germany. Karl Lauterbach, a senior German politician and professor of epidemiology, said in response to the report: \"The exclusive sale of a possible vaccine to the USA must be prevented by all means. Capitalism has limits.\" CureVac tweeted Monday it \"rejects all allegations from press\" about any offers from the US government.\\xa0  Visit Business Insider\\'s homepage for more stories. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Loading\\n Something is loading.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Thanks for signing up!\\n \\n \\n Access your favorite topics in a personalized feed while you\\'re on the go.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n President Donald Trump tried to recruit German scientists working on a coronavirus vaccine and offered large sums of money to secure exclusive rights to their work for the US, according to a report said to be confirmed by the German government. The prominent German newspaper Welt am Sonntag reported that Trump had offered large sums of money to lure the Germany-based company CureVac to the US and to secure exclusive rights to a vaccine. The firm is working with the federally owned Paul Ehrlich Institute for Vaccines and Biomedical Medicines on a vaccine for the coronavirus. CureVac denied \"rumors of an acquisition\" Sunday, and followed it up with a more direct denial of any solicitations from the US on Monday.\\xa0\\n \\n \"CureVac has not received from the US government or related entities an offer before, during and since the Task Force meeting in the White House on March 2,\" the company tweeted Monday. \"CureVac rejects all allegations from press.\" A German government source told the newspaper Trump was trying hard to find a coronavirus vaccine for the US, \"but only for the USA.\" The newspaper said the German government was fighting back by offering financial incentives to the company if it remained in Germany. A German health ministry representative told Welt am Sonntag the government was involved in \"intensive\" discussions with CureVac about keeping the company headquartered in Germany.\\n \\n \"The German government is very interested in ensuring that vaccines and active substances against the new coronavirus are also developed in Germany and Europe,\" the newspaper quoted a health ministry official as saying. \"In this regard, the government is in intensive exchange with the company CureVac.\"   Also read: Everything you need to know about CureVac, the drugmaker working on a coronavirus vaccine that\\'s at the heart of a Trump-Germany controversy    In a separate statement, the health ministry told Reuters the Welt am Sonntag report was accurate: \"We confirm the report in the Welt am Sonntag,\" a representative said.\\n \\n Florian von der Muelbe, CureVac\\'s chief production officer and cofounder, told Reuters last week that the company hoped to have an experimental vaccine ready by June or July so the company could seek permission to start testing on humans. He said a low-dose vaccine the company hoped to develop could make it suitable for mass production within CureVac\\'s existing facilities.  In a statement last week, CureVac said its outgoing CEO, Daniel Menichella, had been invited to the White House for a meeting with Trump to discuss strategies and opportunities for the production of a coronavirus vaccine. \"We are very confident that we will be able to develop a potent vaccine candidate within a few months,\" Menichella said in a statement.\\n \\n Karl Lauterbach, a senior German politician and professor of health economics and epidemiology, tweeted in response to the story: \"The exclusive sale of a possible vaccine to the USA must be prevented by all means.

Here\\'s everything we know.   \\n   As the coronavirus crisis escalated in recent days, Donald Trump repeatedly cast the pandemic as something nobody could have seen coming. “Who would have thought?” he said during a recent trip to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Who would have thought we would even be having the subject?” But according to Politico’s Dan Diamond, Trump’s own White House recognized the gravity of the public health emergency, but the president personally undermined its response, seemingly more concerned about how it all would impact his reelection bid. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar raised alarms with Trump that the novel coronavirus “could be a major problem,” according to Diamond. And yet the president declined to act with urgency, refusing to push for testing that could lead to a larger number of confirmed cases in the United States that would undercut his efforts to play down the threat. “He did not push to do aggressive testing in recent weeks, and that’s partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak,” Diamond told NPR’s Fresh Air Thursday. “And the president had made clear—the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall.” Trump has publicly suggested as much. During that same trip to the CDC last week, he told reporters that he wanted to have infected Diamond Princess passengers “stay on” the cruise ship, so as to keep them from being counted among the confirmed coronavirus cases on U.S. soil. “I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault,” Trump said. That Trump has and continues to filter the crisis through his craven and crude political calculus is unsurprising. But as Diamond reported last week, the president’s self-interest has undercut efforts by the federal government to combat the virus—“resisting attempts to plan for worst-case scenarios, overturning a public-health plan upon request from political allies and repeating only the warnings that he chose to hear.” Perhaps the clearest symptom of his mishandling? The inadequate testing that could have helped the U.S. face the pandemic head on, something officials told Politico stemmed from the president’s disregard and aides’ reluctance to give him bad news. “It always ladders to the top,” one person helping to advise the administration’s response told the outlet. “Trump’s created an atmosphere where the judgment of his staff is that he shouldn’t need to know these things.” The president putting his own political interests over the well-being of the American people would constitute a stunning dereliction of duty. Crises have a way of throwing the truth into stark relief. Of course, the truth about Trump—that he is bewilderingly ignorant and incorrigibly narcissistic—has been obvious throughout his presidency and needed no pandemic to be revealed. And yet, his response to the rapidly escalating coronavirus threat seems to lay bare his unfitness for office in a way perhaps no other Trumpian fiasco has before it. At every turn, he has sought to minimize the crisis—but his “nothing to see here!” act has not changed the reality of the situation. And when aides finally convinced him to deliver an address to the nation, after the World Health Organization officially labeled coronavirus a pandemic, his careless assurances to the nation backfired, thanks to a remarkably messy speech in which he misstated key aspects of his own administration’s policy. “I think we’ll look back on this as a defining moment of the Trump presidency because it speaks to larger concerns that people already had about Trump—that he can’t tell the truth, that he doesn’t value expertise, that he doesn’t take the presidency seriously enough,” Ben Rhodes, a former senior aide to Barack Obama, told the Washington Post.  The irony, of course, is that Trump’s attempts to keep coronavirus from impacting his campaign have resulted in an obviously mismanaged response to the crisis that may now be the biggest obstacle to his reeelection. “You could make a strong argument that the only thing that matters to the president’s reelection now is getting the response corredct,” Scott Jennings, a former top aide to George W. Bush, told Politico. “No rally is going to save you if you are judged as having failed as the president.” More Great Stories From Vanity Fair  — How coronavirus is creating a fake-news nightmarescape — Why do Dubai’s princesses keep trying to escape?— Is Karen Pence’s transformation a play for 2024?— A Nassim Taleb protégé has tips on how to prepare for the coming market crash — Health officials and scientists are now banned from speaking about coronavirus — This is how Matt Gaetz became Trump’s ultimate protégé — From the Archive: Inside Stephen Glass’s web of deception that emerged as the most sustained fraud in modern journalism  Looking for more?

But speculations became even rifer after the POTUS made some statements about the deadly coronavirus outbreak.  Political Flare journalist Jason Miciak compiled the president’s coronavirus quotes that are reportedly indicative of his mental health struggles. On March 10, the POTUS talked about the briefing that he received on every contingency imaginable. “Many contingencies. A lot of positive. Different numbers, all different numbers, very large numbers, and some small numbers too,” he said. On March 11, the POTUS talked about the media. “The media should view this as a time of unity and strength. We have a common enemy, actually, an enemy of the world, the coronavirus. We must beat it as quickly and safely as possible. There is nothing more important to me than the life and safety of the United States,” he said. Three days later, Melania Trump’s husband revealed that there have already been 40 deaths due to the outbreak in the United States alone. “To this point, and because we have had a very strong border policy, we have had 40 deaths related to coronavirus. If we had weak or open borders, that number would be many times higher!” he said. The journalist uploaded a video of Trump where gave an update regarding the coronavirus at a press conference. The POTUS seemed glum while giving an update to the nation. It was also evident that Trump had a hard time reading the teleprompter. At times when he couldn’t pronounce certain words properly, the POTUS would slow down a bit and try to enunciate his words. Since dementia is characterized by a decline in memory, language, problem-solving and other thinking skills, netizens couldn’t help but believe that Trump is suffering from the condition. As of late, Trump hasn’t been diagnosed with dementia so the claims are nothing more than just speculations.  \\n\\n\\n(FILES) In this file photo US President Donald Trump (R) speaks with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro during a dinner at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on March 7, 2020\\nAFP / JIM WATSON\\n\\n  © Copyright IBTimes 2023. All rights reserved.  Donald Trump owes his election to the moral choices of millions of voters—not to Facebook ads    FIRST IT WAS Steve Bannon; then Jared Kushner; now it is Brad Parscale. Ever since Donald Trump began persuading millions of Americans to support him while behaving as no successful politician ever had, mainstream commentators have looked for the evil genius pulling his strings. Messrs Bannon and Kushner were both auditioned for the part, but rejected, after achieving little in office besides notoriety. Now, as Mr Trump’s re-election campaign starts going full tilt, Mr Parscale is being considered.    Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.  Your browser does not support the <audio> element.  Save time by listening to our audio articles as you multitask    Tremulous profiles of the Trump campaign’s manager are the latest thing in political reporting. They typically start by noting his intimidating height, bullish demeanour and “Viking beard” (“I get the Viking thing often,” Mr Parscale has acknowledged). Such attributes are on-brand with a president fixated on central casting—as are other features of the 44-year-old Mr Parscale’s rise from obscurity in San Antonio, Texas, where he worked as an online marketer, to command the heights of the politics business. Like Mr Trump—who launched Mr Parscale by paying him $1,500 to design his first campaign website—he is a political gadfly, rabble-rouser and dissembler. A sometime libertarian, who has rarely voted, he is now a staple warm-up act at Trump rallies: praising the president and attacking his enemies. A self-described “farm boy from Kansas”, he in fact grew up in suburbia, the son of a wannabe Democratic politician. But, again like Mr Trump, he has a reputation for native cunning and outlandish success that can make such foibles seem colourfully additive or irrelevant. Mr Parscale’s reputation is based on Mr Trump’s 2016 digital campaign, which he led. A Facebook executive described it as “the single best digital ad campaign I’ve ever seen”. Heavily focused on Facebook advertising, it was credited with micro-targeting thousands of Trump voters in swing states with the half-truths and xenophobic messaging that Mr Parscale has a gift for turning from Mr Trump’s lips into ad copy. And sometimes the other way round: he is also credited with persuading the president to swap “illegal immigrants” for “illegal aliens”, a more stimulating phrase. The liberal commentariat fears Mr Parscale is about to repeat his electoral feat. Mr Trump’s campaign is now awash with cash and even more ambitiously digitised than it was in 2016. It also stands to benefit disproportionately from his incumbency, because digital campaigning is based on data-gathering, which he has been doing non-stop. Perhaps a million people have attended the hundred-odd rallies he has held since his election, and many more provided their names and phone numbers to register for one. At a rally in South Carolina last month one attendee, with phone in hand, showed your columnist what happens next. Every few hours she had received a text message, purportedly from one of Mr Trump’s sons, demanding cash. “My father asked me to reach out personally, friend…Don’t disappoint him,” ran the latest from Eric Trump. By such means Mr Trump and his proxies have raised over $200m, far more than their Democratic rivals. That sort of money buys impunity as well as advertising. Though Facebook has tried to impose a code of conduct on political advertisers—for example, it vowed to block content ruled untrue by a third-party fact-checker—the Trump campaign has often violated its terms. And in response the platform has backed down; for example, although the campaign recently pushed a lie linking Joe Biden to corruption in Ukraine, Facebook decided to make political campaigns exempt from its fact-checking rule. This is a promise of yet more disinformation and divisiveness. Yet whether Mr Parscale’s digital knavery will affect Mr Trump’s chances of re-election is moot. Academic studies of political advertising suggest it reinforces existing biases but is almost useless at changing voters’ minds. Americans’ partisan affiliations and familiarity with advertising are too strong. “The best estimate of the effects of campaign contact and advertising on Americans’ candidate choices in general elections is zero,” concluded the authors of a recent meta-study of electoral research. Mike Bloomberg spent half a billion dollars proving the same point in a primary contest. It bought him some decent poll numbers, but the moment he faced critical coverage after a bad debate performance, they collapsed. Digital campaigning is fast-evolving. But, notwithstanding the fears he is inspiring, there is little reason to think Mr Parscale has anything up his sleeve that could alter this reassuring picture. His main ploy in 2016 was to use Facebook technology to raise money, according to David Karpf of George Washington University, an expert on disinformation. Mr Parscale was told how to do so by Facebook staffers loaned to the campaign. Otherwise, the Trump campaign’s digital strategy was not fundamentally different from Hillary Clinton’s. Her campaign also spent heavily on Facebook. The mystique surrounding Mr Parscale and his digital arts appears to be largely a product of vested interests. Political operatives revere ads in part because many have got rich on them, including Mr Parscale. One of his many firms has charged the Trump campaign and related organisations nearly $35m since 2017, mostly to pay for ads it has commissioned. This has also given Facebook, the main beneficiary of Mr Parscale’s strategy, an obvious incentive to talk up his genius and the potency of digital advertising—though there is no compelling evidence for either claim. Look at the data Journalists who covered the 2016 election also have reasons to buy the myth of Mr Trump’s digital mastery. It allows them to downplay their own responsibility for his win by providing blanket coverage of the Republican candidate and the many slanders he levelled at Mrs Clinton, concerning her emails, alleged corruption and so forth. It is also a means to avoid confronting the uncomfortable fact that 63m Americans heard who Mr Trump was from his own mouth, unfiltered, and still voted for him. That is a better explanation for his success than Mr Parscale’s dark arts.■  Dig deeper:    Sign up and listen to Checks and Balance, our new newsletter and podcast on American politics    Explore our guide to the US 2020 elections    This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline \"Digital myths and political reality\"  United States March 14th 2020   Covid-19 is spreading rapidly in America.

I have the right to also take him and put him in a regular position and put somebody else in charge. And I haven’t made any decisions on that,” Trump told reporters during a coronavirus briefing at the White House.\\n \\n Legal scholars say that Powell can only be removed or demoted “for cause” and that this must involve something more serious than a disagreement over policy. But the picture is a bit muddied because a novel legal theory arguing that a president should have more power over independent federal agencies such as the Fed has become popular among some of the new conservative judges appointed to federal courts by Republicans including Trump. Legal experts note this is an untested theory and would likely lead to years of litigation in the federal courts. In the meantime, Powell would likely be able to complete his four-year term as chairman, which ends in 2022. And the uncertainty would roil financial markets, economists said. There are Fed watchers who consider the central bank to have been all too accommodating to Trump’s stated wishes, including the well-known consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who suggested the Fed had sacrificed independence in the Trump era:\\n \\n Demoting Powell, whom Trump nominated to lead the central bank after opting not to renew Janet Yellen’s tenure, would also be highly questionable. Former Fed officials have said a demotion would also have to be “for cause.”  Read: Why Trump can’t fire Powell  The Washington Post reported this week that Trump was furious with the Fed and blamed the central bank for the massive stock declines over the past few weeks. The heights achieved by the Dow Jones Industrial Average\\n DJIA,\\n -1.02%\\n during his term in office had been a source of pride for, and the topic of boasts from, the president. Trump said he was pleased stocks rallied during his Rose Garden press conference on Friday.  See: Trump touts ‘biggest stock market rise in history’ on Friday, though Monday, Wednesday and Thursday had brought history-making declines \\n \\n The Dow industrials are now up slightly less than 17% overall since Trump’s inauguration, even after Friday’s nearly 9.4% bounce.  During the Saturday press conference, Trump complained the Fed was not being proactive and was “following.” “Our Fed is not doing what they should be doing. We shouldn’t have a Fed [interest] rate that his higher than our competitor nations. If you look at Germany, they are essentially under zero. Japan is negative. Others are negative,” Trump said. Economists see negative interest rates in Germany and Japan as a signal that their economies face weaker outlooks than does the U.S. economy. But Trump has long insisted it would be better if the U.S. had the lowest interest rates of any major economy. Fed watchers think the Fed is in fact going to take aggressive action this week and cut its benchmark rate by a full percentage point to a range of 0% to 0.25%, on the heels of a rare intermeeting rate reduction early this month. The Fed leadership has been clear that it does not believe pushing the benchmark interest rate below zero would help the economy.  Read on:  5 things to watch for when Fed meets on Tuesday and Wednesday \\n \\n \\n \\nAll of a sudden, we live in a world without crowds. And for Trump, it’s an existential threat—as much a threat as a sinking economy or the virus itself. Because Trump doesn’t just love crowds. He needs them. He needs crowds because of their political utility. Needs them to mine “data gold.” Needs them to be rolling, roiling, visceral focus groups—listening to the ebbs and flows of their roars, serving them what they want, scrapping what they don’t, stoking support with a skilled evangelist’s call and response. He is, after all, at his best and most effective riffing to the rank and file as opposed to monotonously reciting from a teleprompter all alone in the solemnity of the Oval Office. And he needs crowds, too, and perhaps most importantly, on account of psychological necessity.\\n“They are his lifeline,” Bandy Lee, a Yale University psychiatrist and the editor of The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, told me this week. “He’s very good at this,” she said, referring to the catalog of his performances at his rallies, “because his life depends on it, not just the life of his presidency but the life of his psyche.”\\nIn the estimation of Lee and other experts of her ilk, as well as the many people who have known him and worked with him for years, the way Trump is ties back to the way he was raised. The “complete emptiness inside,” the “bottomless void” that “can never be filled,” the “psychological defects” and “pathologically narcissistic traits”—all of this, says Lee, is a result of the core particulars of Trump’s upbringing: his distant and demanding father, the disruptive near-death experience of his mother when he was just a toddler, his banishment to military school when he was barely a teenager.\\n“The lack of love translates into desiring accolades,” Lee explained. “And the rallies are really the most critical crutches that he’s had. He needs his followers more than his followers need him.”\\nTrump biographer Gwenda Blair calls “a live audience” his “oxygen machine.”\\n“The crowds,” former Trump casino executive Jack O’Donnell told me the other day, “get him through the night.”\\nAnd it’s always been like this.\\nStarting in the 1970s and ‘80s, the foundationally lonely Trump cultivated transactional relationships with reporters and gossip columnists, in the same manner as his mentor, Roy Cohn. At times, he used a fake name to do his own PR. He decorated the walls of his office with magazine covers bearing images of his own face.\\nIn Atlantic City, at his casinos, he jaunted across gaming floors, feasting on the clamor of the throngs. “They cheered him,” recalled Alan Marcus, a former Trump publicist. “In front of a big crowd, and a big crowd could’ve been 25 people or 25,000 people, he can shine. Because he’s got that Trump persona. The Trump persona takes over the room.”\\nBy the middle of the aughts, when the success of “The Apprentice” erased the stain of his personal failures and business busts of the ‘ ’ 90s, he obsessed about the reality show’s ratings. “Ratings,” said Marcus, “are crowds.”\\nAnd Trump’s political ascent? Implausible to the point of impossible without crowds.\\nIn the couple years before 2015, on the precampaign campaign trail, at off-year cattle calls of would-be candidates, Trump tested out talking points. “He would put forth his position or his feelings, and he would judge the level of response,” the late political strategist Pat Caddell once told me. He monitored not internal polling but Twitter mentions and tallies of retweets. He gauged what sizzled on conservative talk radio so he could channel it back.\\nAt his campaign kickoff at Trump Tower, when he glided down the escalator to say that he was running, the crowd was so important he paid some people to be there. The next month, he drew approximately 4,000 people to a rally in Phoenix. A month after that, the crowd was roughly five times that size in Mobile, Alabama, where he had his plane circle the stadium to a standing ovation and the wild-eyed appeal of his candidacy became hard to ignore. “Trump’s campaign,” Roger Stone would write, “was centered around a ‘set piece rally.’”\\nAt one of them, in New Hampshire, he told the people he had lots of friends, and rich friends, but who no longer would be his friends if and when he got elected.\\n“You know who my friends are?” he said. “You’re my friends.”\\nThe crowd.\\nTheir cheers.\\nAnd ever since, all the way up to his last rally, in Charlotte, on the second night of this month, Trump has engaged in an almost hypnotic version of the same, over and over again, using every one of his signature events to draw red-capped crowds, and to talk about the size of the crowds—whether or not, of course, the specifics are true—seldom missing a chance to employ the crowds and their counts as an ongoing contrast to cudgel his Democratic opponents.\\n“An integral, main part of the campaign,” Trump’s campaign spokesman has said.\\n“The driving force,” according to the campaign’s COO.\\nBut as America shuts down, as Broadway goes dark and Disney World goes dormant and March Madness goes poof, Trump at the moment has been stripped of arguably his most potent political strength. Entering a new, utterly altered reality, mere weeks after he traveled to India to revel in the adoration of a crowd of 110,000, Trump sat in the White House at a desk called Resolute and appeared out of his element and underprepared—while Joe Biden, his presumptive opponent in the general election, stood the next afternoon in front of a bank of American flags in a hotel in Delaware and spoke to mostly just clicking cameras and seemed not frail or poorly supported but serious and up to the task. Biden’s (small) crowds and Trump’s (large) crowds hardly matter because now there are no crowds at all.\\n“Rallies are important to the Trump campaign, and I’d worry about losing them,” former Trump aide Michael Caputo said, “because it would tilt a bit to Biden’s advantage.”\\nAnother former Trump aide pushed back on the premise. “It’s very early in the presidential cycle,” Sam Nunberg told me. “He’s still going to be able to hold rallies eventually, calling the guy ‘Sleepy Joe’ and making fun of him … one way or the other.”\\nNunberg stressed that Trump still has television and Twitter, platforms on which he has an irrefutable record of mastery of a certain sort, and that his flush campaign is a Facebook juggernaut, too, and that he always has possessed a blithe capacity for surviving crises and skirting consequence. All valid points.\\nHe made a prediction.\\n“Trump will end up doing rallies,” Nunberg said. “Pandemic or not, Trump will end up doing rallies.”\\n“What are your plans, Mr. President,” a reporter asked him on Thursday, “about campaign rallies?”\\n“I think the Democrats won’t be having rallies, but nobody shows up to their rallies, anyway,” Trump said. “So, what difference does it make?”\\n“But what about you, sir?”\\n“My rallies are very big,” he said.\\n“On the rallies, we’ll make that decision,” he continued. “But at this moment, we don’t have …” He stopped himself—as if he couldn’t quite bring himself to say it out loud. “I was going to Las Vegas. … I was going to Colorado …”\\nHe fantasized about a rally in Tampa on March 25 that reportedly was being planned but had not been publicly announced. That didn’t prevent him from dropping highly dubious details. “All sold out,” Trump said. “We have over 100,000 requests for tickets, but I think we’ll probably not do it because people would say it’s better to not do.”\\nNo more rallies.\\nNo more crowds.\\n“It’s like, if Don Rickles performed to a room of three people, would he have been funny? You know, insult comics, they need the energy of the discomfort they create for the jokes to work, for the act to work,” Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio told me this week. “It’s very bad for Trump to not have crowds. And I think he knows it.” \\n   President Donald Trump owns three golf resorts in the European countries he has spared from his travel ban. Foreign nationals from all 26 countries of the Schengen Area, which make up most of Europe, will be barred from entering the U.S. for at least 30 days as protection against the spread of coronavirus, Trump announced Wednesday. The United Kingdom and Ireland are not part of that group, but they do have cases of coronavirus — and Trump golf resorts.  The president’s Trump Organization owns a golf course in Doonbeg, Ireland, and two in Scotland: Trump Turnberry and Trump International Golf Links.   Trump said Thursday that he exempted the U.K. from the travel ban because he believes conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson is doing a “good job” battling coronavirus. But several health experts disagree with Trump’s assessment.  Trump’s decision is “clearly not based on science,” Jeremy Konyndyk, a Center for Global Development fellow who helped the U.S. deal with the Ebola crisis, told Foreign Policy magazine. Johnson has been attacked for being slow to take action to stop the spread of the illness, such as shutting down large gatherings to head off widespread contagion. Johnson declared on Britain’s “This Morning” TV program on Tuesday that one coronavirus “theory” is that people should “take it on the chin” and allow the disease to “move through the population.” But, he added, “I think we need to strike a balance.”  Richard Horton, the editor in chief of the medical journal The Lancet, accused Johnson of “playing roulette with the public” by taking his time instituting changes.   The UK government—Matt Hancock and Boris Johnson—claim they are following the science. But that is not true. The evidence is clear. We need urgent implementation of social distancing and closure policies. The government is playing roulette with the public. This is a major error.— richard horton (@richardhorton1) March 10, 2020   In a marked change of tone, however, similar to that exhibited by Trump, Johnson said Thursday that the virus threatens the “worst health crisis in a generation” and that “many more” people will die. But he wasn’t quite prepared to stop major sporting events.  Though Italy and France have far more cases of coronavirus, 590 cases were reported Thursday in Britain — a 30% jump from the previous day. The chief health officer of the U.K. believes as many as 10,000 people could already be infected.  Ten people have died of the illness there. Ireland reported its first death Wednesday and is canceling St. Patrick’s Day celebrations this year. Trump’s former Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert said that a ban on European travelers makes little sense now that the illness is already being passed within U.S. communities.   There’s little value to European travel restrictions. Poor use of time & energy.\\xa0Earlier, yes. Now, travel restrictions/screening are less useful. We have nearly as much disease here in the US as the countries in Europe. We MUST focus on layered community mitigation measures-Now!— Thomas P. Bossert (@TomBossert) March 12, 2020     The irony is that if we don’t implement aggressive community interventions and mitigate the spread of the virus already in the United States, we will end up infecting or reinfecting Europe. #coronavirus — Thomas P. Bossert (@TomBossert) March 12, 2020   Trump blamed the European Union for exporting cases to the U.S., a strategy some critics said was intended to deflect criticism from his administration.  As president, Trump has frequently showcased his golf resorts in Scotland and Ireland, which have struggled financially. He took an entourage to Doonbeg after a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II last year. Vice President Mike Pence went three hours out of his way to stay at Trump’s resort in Doonbeg last year, even though he had traveled to Ireland to meet with the nation’s prime minister in Dublin. The U.S. Air Force spent nearly $200,000 at Trump’s Turnberry resort for lodging during refueling stops at a small airport near the resort.

Trump has been accused of failing to pay hundreds of contractors. And so far, he hasn\\'t seemed very sorry. When asked about failing to pay someone by Hillary Clinton this week, Trump replied, “Maybe he didn\\'t do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work.” I take that attack personally. I\\'m one of the many small business owners who\\'ve been used by Trump, exploited and forced to suffer a loss because of his corporation\\'s shady practices. My relationship with Trump began in 1989, when he asked me to supply several grand and upright pianos to his then-new Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. I\\'d been running a music store for more than 30 years at that point, selling instruments to local schools and residents. My business was very much a family affair (my grandsons still run the store). And I had a great relationship with my customers — no one had ever failed to pay. I was thrilled to get a $100,000 contract from Trump. It was one of the biggest sales I\\'d ever made. I was supposed to deliver and tune the pianos; the Trump corporation would pay me within 90 days. I asked my lawyer if I should ask for payment upfront, and he laughed. “It\\'s Donald Trump!” he told me. “He\\'s got lots of money.” But when I requested payment, the Trump corporation hemmed and hawed. Its executives avoided my calls and crafted excuses. After a couple of months, I got a letter telling me that the casino was short on funds. They would pay 70 percent of what they owed me. There was no negotiating. I didn\\'t know what to do — I couldn\\'t afford to sue the Trump corporation, and I needed money to pay my piano suppliers. So I took the $70,000. Losing $30,000 was a big hit to me and my family. The profit from Trump was meant to be a big part of my salary for the year. So I made much less. There was no money to help grow my business. I had fewer pianos in the showroom and a smaller advertising budget. Because of Trump, my store stagnated for a couple of years. It made me feel really bad, like I\\'d been taken advantage of. I was embarrassed. Today, when I hear Trump brag about paying small business owners less than he agreed, I get angry. He\\'s always suggesting that the people who worked for him didn\\'t do the right job, didn\\'t complete their work on time, that something was wrong. But I delivered quality pianos, tuned and ready to go. I did everything right. And then Trump cheated me. It\\'s a callous way to do business. Trump keeps saying that it\\'s time we got a businessman to run the country. Of course, I think it\\'s important to find someone who can bolster the economy. But I also think we need a president who cares about small business owners, and about honoring his commitments. That\\'s not Trump.

Ein knappes Dutzend Manager von Pharmakonzernen und Biotechnologie-Unternehmen saßen Anfang März an einem Tisch im Weißen Haus, zusammen mit US-Präsident Donald Trump.

Und wenn es um wichtige Infrastruktur und nationale und europäische Interessen geht, dann werden wir notfalls auch handeln.\" Schon zuvor hatte eine Sprecherin des Ministeriums gesagt, dass die Bundesregierung ein hohes Interesse habe, Wirkstoffe und Impfstoffe in Deutschland und Europa zu produzieren. Das Wirtschaftsministerium kann, sofern die Voraussetzungen erfüllt sind und eine Gefährdung der öffentlichen Ordnung und Sicherheit droht, den Erwerb von Firmen untersagen oder entsprechende Anordnungen\\xa0erlassen. Es geht um viel Geld. Zwei Milliarden Dollar würden gebraucht, um einen Impfstoff gegen die durch Sars-CoV-2 ausgelöste Krankheit Covid-19 zu entwickeln, schreibt die Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi) auf ihrer Internetseite. Die internationale Impfstoffallianz hat auch einen genauen Zeitplan mit mehreren Phasen. 100 Millionen Dollar würden sofort gebraucht, um acht Impfstoffkandidaten durch die erste klinische Phase zu bringen. In einem zweiten Schritt seien es bis Ende März dann weitere 375 Millionen Dollar, um Material für die zweite und dritte klinische Phase herzustellen und um in den Aufbau weltweiter Produktionskapazitäten zu investieren. Bis Ende Juni würden in einer dritten Phase dann noch einmal 400 Millionen Dollar gebraucht und in der vierten, im Jahr 2021, 500 bis 750 Millionen Dollar. Erst dann würden alle Tests und die Zulassung von Impfstoffen gegen Corona abgeschlossen\\xa0sein. Curevac weist Behauptungen über Übernahme zurück An der Entwicklung von Impfstoffen arbeiten mehrere Firmen und Institute. Sie sind auf der Internetseite der Impfstoffallianz aufgelistet. Curevac zählt dazu, aber auch die börsennotierten US-Biotechnologiekonzerne Novavax, Inovio und Moderna. Die Universität Oxford und die Universität von Queensland arbeiten ebenfalls an einem Impfstoff. Die Cepi unterstützt sie alle mit Geld. Ende Februar schlossen Curevac und die Impfstoffallianz einen Vertrag im Volumen von bis zu 34 Millionen Dollar zur Entwicklung eines mobilen Printers, mit dem, wie es heißt, \"geringe Mengen\" an Boten-RNA produziert werden\\xa0können. Gut eine Woche nach dem Treffen im Weißen Haus war Menichella seinen Chefposten los. \"Ingmar Hoerr kennt das Unternehmen und dessen Identität durch und durch. Als Gründungs-CEO, Wissenschaftler und Visionär ist er der Richtige, Curevac in die Zukunft zu führen\", lobte Jean Stéphenne, der stellvertretende Aufsichtsratschef, Menichellas Nachfolger. Das Lob klingt wie eine ziemlich genaue Beschreibung dessen, was dem Vorgänger fehlte. Menichella war Angestellter, ist Amerikaner, hatte für Curevac vom zweiten Standort aus das US-Geschäft aufgebaut - und er ist Betriebswirt, kein Naturwissenschaftler. Wie es heißt, soll Investor Dietmar Hopp auf den Wechsel gedrängt\\xa0haben. Die SPD-Gesundheitspolitikerin Bärbel Bas sagt, es handele sich hier \"um eine ethische, nicht wirtschaftliche oder gar nationale Frage. Wenn es einen Impfstoff gibt, muss er allen zur Verfügung stehen. Alles andere wäre ein\\xa0Skandal\".  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n When Northwestern University psychologist\\xa0Dan P. McAdams\\xa0first wrote about Donald Trump’s psyche for “The Atlantic” in 2016, he knew his subject was not your average politician. He just couldn’t nail down why.\\xa0   His new book,\\xa0“The Strange Case of Donald J. Trump: A Psychological Reckoning”\\xa0(Oxford University Press, March 2020), provides some surprising answers. Trump, McAdams asserts, may be the rare person who lacks any inner story, something most people develop to givetheir lives unity, meaning and purpose. ‘Truly authentic fake’ A life story provides a moral frame of reference because it grounds your experiences in basic values and beliefs,\\xa0according to McAdams, a narrative psychologist who pioneered the study of lives. Trump, McAdams argues, can’t form a meaningful life story because he is the “episodic man” who sees life as a series of battles to be won. There is no connection between the moments, no reflection and no potential for growth when one is compulsively in the present. Donald Trump is a “truly authentic fake,” writes McAdams, professor of human development and social policy at the School of Education and Social Policy. “Trump is always acting, always on stage — but that is who he really is, and that is\\xa0all\\xa0he really is.\\xa0He is not introspective, retrospective or prospective. He does not go deep into his mind; he does not travel back to the past; he does not project far into the future. He is always on the surface, always right now. “In his own mind, he is more like a persona than a person, more like a primal force or superhero, rather than a fully realized human being,” McAdams adds. Psychological facets of the president McAdams’ eighth and latest book, a four-year project, is a collection of\\xa0stand-alone essays that each explore a single psychological facet of the president. Taken together, “The Strange Life of Donald J Trump” connects Trump’s lack of a life story — or what psychologists call a “narrative identity” — to various personality traits. “Truth for Donald Trump is whatever works to win in the moment,” McAdams writes. “He moves through life\\xa0episode by episode, from one battle to the next, striving in turn, to win each one. The episodes don’t add up or form a narrative arc.” McAdams, the Henry Wade Rogers Professor of Psychology at Northwestern’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, studies personality and how people change over time. His narrative approach to studying human lives places stories and\\xa0storytelling at the center of human personality. Looking for redemption stories For more than two decades, McAdams and his students have been coding life-story interviews, looking for themes of one particular life story — redemption. Their published work shows that people who tell their life story in redemptive terms — such as overcoming suffering or adversity — enjoy better mental health and higher levels of happiness, compared to people whose life stories show fewer themes of redemption. Moreover, researchers have found strong associations between redemptive life stories and an adult’s concern about the well-being of future generations, something that comes into sharper focus as people age. In previous books, McAdams applied his tools of psychological interpretation to the lives of U.S. Presidents\\xa0George W. Bush\\xa0and Barack Obama. Despite their differences, both leaders had moving redemptive life stories, atoning for past mistakes, overcoming obstacles or mounting powerful comebacks. Statements, not stories But for Trump, McAdams says, there can be no comeback story, because when a hero wins every scene there is nothing to come back from. “He can’t show any kind of growth or learning, because to grow you have to have once been small,” he says. It may appear that Trump has stories. He can spin a tale about Mexican drug smugglers and proclaims himself to be the “greatest president ever,” “a stable genius” and the “smartest man on the face of the earth. “But these are proclamations of a generic trait and statements about the self, not stories about the self,” McAdams writes. “They don’t show how he came to be and where his life may be going. They do not explain how he has changed over time, how he has developed and how he was once one thing and is now another. They do not convey any sense of humanity.” One of the most shocking and unprecedented features of the Trump presidency is Trump’s refusal to adopt a moral language for leadership, McAdams says,\\xa0which stems directly from his failure to create a moral story for his own life. “He sees the U.S. as a force in the world, but not a moral force,” McAdams writes. “Unlike any U.S. president for the past 100 years, Trump does not even feign interest in championing such hallowed American values as respect for human rights or opposition to tyranny. He is purely transactional. “The features of Trump’s strange personality — his orientation to love, his proclivity for untruth, his narcissistic goal agenda, his authoritarian sentiments — can be fully appreciated and understood only if we realize that they revolve around the empty narrative core, the hollow inner space where the story should be, but never was,” McAdams says. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Editor’s Picks\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    Just as we are asking our frail, vulnerable, easily confused old people to stay indoors, America is being asked to put them in the White House. It would be ironic, if Americans had any concept of what that was. So much for the cult of youth. Democrat contenders Joe Biden, 77, and Bernie Sanders, 78, were born closer to Grover Cleveland’s inauguration than Barack Obama’s. Sanders hoped that just rehashing his socialist schtick with more giveaways and louder music would produce a different result to last time. The Labour Party should have warned him. And moderates have belatedly decided to get behind Biden, someone who has been knocking round politics for years, always the deputy never the bride, but who has a habit of being   \\n  \\n \\n CNN\\n \\xa0—\\xa0\\n \\n\\n \\n Businesses owned or branded by President Donald Trump have charged the federal government at least $1.2 million in taxpayer money for various services since 2016, records show.\\n \\n \\n \\n Hotels, clubs and restaurants owned by Trump or bearing his name have billed various federal agencies and personnel more than $1 million since he became the Republican nominee for president, according to documents obtained by CNN and two nonprofit, government-watchdog organizations, Property of the People and Public Citizen. \\n \\n \\n The documents, mostly obtained through public records requests, do not offer a complete picture of the US government’s total spending at Trump properties, but do shed light on the unique arrangement in which the same agencies Trump presides over as president have repeatedly paid his private businesses for lodging and other services. The documents – which include invoices from Trump properties, government spreadsheets of expenses and other receipts – also illustrate how federally funded security and staff precede and follow the President on his travels to his for-profit properties. \\n \\n \\n The Trump Organization didn’t dispute the charges identified by CNN. Instead, Eric Trump, the Trump Organization’s executive vice president, characterized them as bargain for the government.\\n \\n \\n “We provide the rooms at cost and could make far more money renting them to members or guests,” Eric Trump said in a statement. “To infer that we are profiting is not only inaccurate but an outright lie,” he added.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Trump spent at least 110 days in 2017 at properties that either bear his surname or that his family companies own, according to CNN’s count. And by March 2018, Trump had spent 100 days at golf clubs bearing his name.\\n \\n \\n About half of the documented expenses involve the U.S. Secret Service, which has been charged more than $600,000 by various Trump properties between September 2016 and August 2019, though it’s unclear if the Secret Service has released all records of Trump-related expenses during that time. Those charges include expenses at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club and his club in Bedminster, New Jersey. \\n \\n \\n The Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., charged the Secret Service about $215,000 between 2016 and 2018, according to a list of transactions that the agency released in a response to a records request. NBC News first reported those transactions.\\n \\n \\n Trump has frequented his DC hotel on many occasions since taking office, making the steakhouse inside the hotel his preferred restaurant to dine at when he’s in Washington. He’s also headlined fundraisers and attended a wedding in the building.\\n \\n \\n A Secret Service spokesperson said, “Due to the nature of the agency’s protective mission, the operational needs of the Secret Service can differ from those traveling on official business for other areas of government. In the daily execution of our protective mission, the Secret Service balances operational security with judicious allocation of resources.”\\n \\n \\n Records also show Trump-branded properties have billed the Department of Defense about $500,000 since 2017. Those expenses involve lodging, food and other services at Trump-owned businesses or others that have paid licensing fees to use Trump’s name, such as one in Panama City. The owners of the Panama hotel have since removed Trump’s name from the property. \\n \\n \\n That amount also includes about $184,000 spent since August 2017 at the Trump Turnberry resort in Scotland, which is about 20 miles from an airport used by the Air Force, according to documents previously shared by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee. An Air Force review of overnight stays by air crews during refueling stops at the airport found military personnel stayed at Trump Turnberry “approximately 6%” of the time between 2015 and 2019, which would have included the Obama administration.\\n \\n \\n DOD spokesperson Jessica R. Maxwell said the department books lodging based on availability, per diem rates and suitability to meet mission requirements.\\n \\n \\n “If the Department were to cease using an available, mission ready, and publicly accessible hotel chain, which is priced within established per diem rates, based solely on politics – then that would be a violation of our commitment to remain apolitical,” Maxwell said.\\n \\n \\n Some of the government spending at Trump-branded properties overlaps with instances when Trump’s children visited those properties. For example, a document released by the State Department shows about $15,000 charged at the Trump International Hotel & Tower Vancouver for a stay in late February 2017, when the President’s sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., their spouses, and the President’s daughter, Tiffany Trump, attended its opening. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n While all modern US presidents have traveled with White House staffers, military aides and Secret Service personnel, some government ethicists and advocacy groups have argued that the scale of the federal expenses at Trump-branded properties coupled with Trump’s refusal to sell his ownership stake in his businesses as he serves as President breaches ethical norms. \\n \\n \\n “Americans elect a president to serve the people, not profit off them. Yet President Trump exploits his office to line his pockets with taxpayer dollars. And the amounts we’re seeing are just the tip of the iceberg,” said Ryan Shapiro, the executive director for Property of the People, a nonprofit organization that advocates for greater government transparency and obtained several government spending records. \\n \\n \\n Trump has refuted the notion that he has profited off the presidency.\\n \\n \\n “They say Trump is getting rich off our nation. I lose billions being President, I don’t care. It’s nice to be rich, I guess. But I lose billions,” Trump said at a campaign rally in October.\\n \\n \\n The White House did not respond to CNN’s questions about the charges. \\n \\n \\n In October, Eric Trump said in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the government has actually saved money by utilizing Trump properties. \\n \\n \\n “Any time the government comes, and if my father travels, they stay at our properties for free, meaning cost for housekeeping effectively, because you actually have to legally charge government something,” he said. “We charge them like 50 bucks.” \\n \\n \\n But the Washington Post reported in February that the Secret Service was billed room rates as high as $650 a night when Trump traveled to Mar-a-Lago in 2017. \\n \\n \\n Other documents suggest Trump’s businesses have charged government agencies more than the cost of housekeeping. For example, a March 2017 receipt from the Coast Guard for a stay at Mar-a-Lago shows a $1,092 bill for a two-night stay. That document states the government was charged the so-called “rack rate” – an industry term that usually implies the non-discounted price for a hotel room. \\n \\n \\n Kathleen Clark, a government ethics expert at Washington University in St. Louis, said Trump’s refusal to separate from his family business while serving as president has created multiple conflicts of interest. She said at the very least Trump should reduce his travel to his properties and encourage officials not to direct funds to his businesses. \\n \\n \\n “If he had divested, we wouldn’t be in this predicament, but even without divesting, he could put the public first and ensure that government officials minimize their spending at his properties… but he hasn’t done that,” Clark said. \\n \\n \\n \\n Trump isn’t the first White House official to have owned properties the government paid to use. The Secret Service paid about $170,000 to rent former Vice President Joe Biden’s property in Delaware, between 2011 and 2017, according to contracting data. A Biden campaign official said the Secret Service paid the same rate as a prior tenant, who paid a price set by a real-estate agent based on market rates.\\n \\n \\n The total amount of taxpayer dollars spent at Trump properties could be much higher than $1.2 million.\\n \\n \\n While the White House has not directly disclosed payments to Trump properties, records released by the State Department suggest the White House has also purchased services from Trump properties. \\n \\n \\n In April 2017, a State Department official wrote in an email that the White House appeared to be using a government purchase card to pay for staff lodging at Mar-a-Lago, according to documents obtained by Property of the People through a records request. \\n \\n \\n Spencer Geissinger, who once served as President George W. Bush’s deputy assistant for operations, said nearly every trip then-President Bush took was preceded by advance staff who prepared for the president’s arrival.\\n \\n \\n Geissinger said even for presidential trips focused on rest and relaxation, travel staff included more than a dozen people. He said staffers who traveled on such trips included a chief of staff or deputy chief of staff, personal aides, two military aides, full Secret Service detail, the White House Press Secretary, the White House doctor, a White House nurse, the White House photographer, White House television staff, Navy Mess personnel “and a few other government officials who carry out functions that are classified.”\\n \\n \\n In his experience, Geissinger said more than a half dozen senior staff members could be involved in the decision making behind a president’s travel.\\n \\n         President Trump clearly doesn\\'t mind shaking hands in the age of coronavirus, and he\\'s making sure he flexes his finger-pointing muscles as well. After attacking former President Barack Obama and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for contributing to COVID-19 coronavirus testing failures, Trump emphasized that he, the current U.S. president, bears no responsibility for the disastrous lag in testing kits being distributed across the country. \"No, I don\\'t take responsibility at all, because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time,\" Trump said during a press conference discussing the pandemic. \"It wasn\\'t meant for this kind of an event, with the kind of numbers that we\\'re talking about. What we\\'ve done is redesign it very quickly.\" As few as 77 kits were administered between Sunday and Wednesday, prompting Dr. Anthony Fauci to call the botched response \"a failing.\" During the press conference, both Trump and Fauci iterated that the current testing system was not designed for the specific needs of the new coronavirus crisis. When prompted later by PBS reporter Yamiche Alcindor over the Trump administration\\'s 2018 shutdown of a pandemic response team, Trump responded by calling the question \"nasty,\" saying he didn\\'t \"know anything\" about the disbanding she spoke of.   My Q: You said you don\\'t take responsibility for slow response to coronavirus but your administration disbanded the White House office on pandemics? President Trump: \"That\\'s a nasty question...When you say me, I didn\\'t do it. We have a group of people [in the administration].\" — Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) March 13, 2020    Trump didn\\'t give exact details on when better testing will be rolled out, but he said to expect an announcement Sunday night and claimed they\\'ll have the \"ability to do in the millions over a very quick period of time.\"  More stories from theweek.com  Hotels and casinos along the Las Vegas Strip are closing their doors due to coronavirus  Tennessee\\'s attorney general investigating man who bought 17,700 bottles of hand sanitizer  Coronavirus is exposing America\\'s shameful selfish streak       WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday declared a national emergency over the fast-spreading coronavirus to free up $50 billion in federal aid and said he would “most likely” be tested for the virus himself soon after facing possible exposure. Trump made the announcement at a Rose Garden news conference as he battled to show Americans he is aggressively addressing the health crisis after facing criticism that he was slow to react and played down the threat until the number of cases rose. Trump cautioned that Americans will have to make sacrifices and change their daily practices, a stark difference from two weeks ago when he said people should use common sense but otherwise not change their routines. “It could get worse. The next eight weeks will be critical,” he said. The president appeared on stage with members of his coronavirus task force and business executives after meeting them inside the White House over how to accelerate testing of Americans for the virus to better track the contagion’s spread. Shaking hands freely with the gathered business executives, the 73-year-old Trump later acknowledged he expected to be tested for the virus. He had come into contact with a Brazilian official last Saturday who later tested positive for coronavirus. “Most likely, yeah, most likely. Not for that reason but because I think I will do it anyway,” Trump said. “Fairly soon. We’re working out a schedule.” “We have no symptoms whatsoever,” he said to a question about whether he should get a test. Trump said Walmart Inc Chief Executive Doug McMillon had agreed to set up drive-thru testing at store parking lots across the country and that Alphabet Inc’s Google will create a website to help determine whether individuals need a coronavirus test. Trump shrugged off a question about whether he was responsible for what many experts have said was slow progress toward expansion of tests to track the virus. “I don’t take responsibility at all,” he said, blaming rules and regulations he inherited for the inability to mass produce the testing kits. Trump, who on Wednesday ordered citizens from 26 European nations not to enter the United States for 30 days as of midnight Friday, said his administration “may be adding” travel restrictions on the United Kingdom and a couple of other countries. As for whether Americans should take commercial flights, Trump was blunt: “If you stay home, it’s not bad. It’s not bad.” The virus that emerged in central China in December has now spread to over 130 countries and territories and infected more than 138,000 people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. It has so far led to 47 U.S. deaths after six more were reported on Friday in hard-hit Washington state and one in Colorado. Trump said his declaration of a national emergency will “unleash the full power of the federal government” to help states and territories in the fight. The announcement gave Wall Street a much-needed boost with the Dow and benchmark S&P 500 both ending the day more than 9% higher. “Through talent or through luck, call it whatever you want, but through a very collective action and shared sacrifice, national determination, we will overcome the threat of the virus,” Trump said. Trump said the battered cruise ship industry could expect help. “We will be helping them and we will be helping the airline industry if we have to, assuming we have to,” he said. Trump had been heavily focused on hard-hit industries in making sure the U.S. economy is not devastated by a slowdown in consumer activity as a result of the virus. On Friday, he used much of his appearance to focus on the potential human toll of the respiratory illness than can cause pneumonia in severe cases. He urged every state to set up emergency centers to help fight the coronavirus. “We’ll remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need and that they’re entitled to. No resource will be spared, nothing whatsoever,” he said. ‘A LONG WAY TO GO’ Pressure has been mounting for Trump to declare an infectious disease emergency under the 1988 law that would allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide disaster funds to state and local governments and to deploy support teams. President Bill Clinton in 2000 employed the rarely used measure to declare such an emergency for West Nile virus. Trump said the federal government was partnering with the private sector to accelerate production of test kits to make them more widely available to Americans. He said there will be about 5 million coronavirus tests available soon but doubted that that many will be needed. He urged Americans to only seek the test if they feel they need it. “We don’t want people to take a test if we feel that they shouldn’t be doing it and we don’t want everyone running out and taking - only if you have certain symptoms,” he said. Alongside Trump was Anthony Fauci, the National Institutes of Health expert who is on Trump’s coronavirus task force. He offered a cautious outlook for what may unfold in the short term. “We still have a long way to go. There will be many more cases. But we’ll take care of that,” said Fauci, long the nation’s top infectious disease expert. “What’s going on here today is going to help it end sooner than it would have.” Trump said the federal government would waive interest on student loans and ordered the Energy Department to take advantage of low oil prices to top up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

President Donald Trump on Friday declared a national emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but spent much of the announcement refusing to take responsibility for testing delays and praising his own inadequate response that helped let the coronavirus spread rapidly throughout much of the country. Joined by representatives from companies like Walgreens, CVS and Quest Diagnostics, Trump unveiled a private-sector partnership to “vastly increase and accelerate our capacity to test for the coronavirus.” He said half a million tests would be available by “early next week.”  “We want to make sure that those who need a test can get a test very safely, quickly and conveniently, but we don’t want people to take a test if we feel that they shouldn’t be doing it,” he said. The national emergency declaration will also allocate up to $50 billion in disaster relief funding to states, effective immediately, Trump said. The president and his administration have faced intense criticism for delays in testing for the new coronavirus. Many states and municipalities have reported a backlog in testing or an inability to test people who suspect they have contracted the virus.  Coronavirus tests are alarmingly hard to come by, which the top infectious disease expert at the National Institutes of Health called “a failing” on Thursday.  Asked about the delays Friday, Trump defiantly said: “I don’t take responsibility at all.”  When asked about his demolition of President Barack Obama’s pandemic response team, Trump called it “a nasty question.”  In announcing the increase in tests, Trump still appeared to downplay the public health crisis. He said that five million tests would be available “within a month,” before adding: “I doubt we’ll need that.”  Much of the testing capability is being provided by the private sector, such as the companies in attendance Friday, as well as large hospital systems and universities. Trump repeatedly praised the companies: for instance, Walmart for providing parking lot space for tests. “There will be many more cases, but we’ll take care of that, and ultimately as the president said, this will end,” the NIH’s Dr. Anthony Fauci said Friday. “But what’s going on here today is going to help it to end sooner than it would have.” Trump also announced measures like the creation of a website where people could type in their symptoms and determine whether they should be tested. But details of how to access it will not be available until Sunday evening. For college students, most of whom are being forced out of campus housing as schools switch to remote learning, Trump said student loan interest rates would be waived. However, loan rates are currently very low, so it would have only a small impact on students facing financial burdens.  The White House has also reportedly pushed to classify top-level coronavirus meetings, a move that has hampered the government’s response to the outbreak.   Trump himself has created confusion and disseminated false information. During a primetime address on Wednesday, he issued a ban on European travel, but subsequently had to announce several clarifications. He has also frequently contradicted guidance from Fauci and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and downplayed the pandemic’s effects.  The travel ban was an illustration of the ways Trump has treated the coronavirus as a foreign invader rather than a domestic health crisis. He and his allies have used racist and nativist rhetoric to describe the pandemic, and much of his response has focused on closing borders and restricting travel rather than addressing problems within the U.S. health care system. Trump opened his press conference Friday by praising his response to the pandemic, claiming it was better “when compared to other places around the world,” touting “our closing of the borders” and claiming experts told him his ban on travel from China “saved a lot of lives.” He also invited Vice President Mike Pence to speak, who praised Trump’s “decisive action.”   CORRECTION: This article previously misidentified Anthony Fauci as being with the CDC; he is with the National Institutes of Health.     On Friday afternoon, Donald Trump held an event in the White House Rose Garden to declare a national emergency. In the light of the coronavirus outbreak, the presidential announcement was not at all surprising, though the event itself was remarkable in its own right. If you watched the gathering with the sound off and paid no attention to what was being said, there were some painfully obvious problems. For example, Trump crowded a group of officials and executives close to one another, before shaking participants\\' hands. Several speakers, including members of the White House Coronavirus Taskforce, then manually adjusted the shared microphone. The president\\'s remarks at the event made matters quite a bit worse. Trump made a series of bizarre and demonstrably false claims on everything from the Obama administration\\'s H1N1 response to a Google resource that\\'s still in development, from European travel restrictions to student-loan payments. The president even overstated the details surrounding plans for drive-through testing. But there was one line in particular that\\'s likely to help define Trump\\'s response to the biggest crisis of his presidency.   Asked Friday at his press conference by NBC News\\' Kristen Welker whether he should take responsibility for the failure to disseminate larger quantities of tests earlier, Trump declined. \"I don\\'t take responsibility at all,\" he said.     No, of course not. Trump has a handful of presidential rules to live by, and near the top of the list is the belief that he\\'s entitled to take credit for all good things that happen while he\\'s in office. It dovetails with the related belief that he can avoid blame for any bad things that happen while he\\'s in office. But reality is stubborn, and there can be no doubt that testing has been one of the critical problems with the federal response to the outbreak. NBC News reported over the weekend that some of Trump\\'s own advisers acknowledged that \"the failure to focus on widespread testing was their biggest misstep. The U.S. is behind most industrialized nations in understanding the extent of infection within its borders.\" One official told NBC News, \"If we all went back, we obviously would\\'ve hit on the testing part more.\" The president could acknowledge this. He doesn\\'t want to. If this sounds at all familiar, it\\'s because Trump has spent more than three years trying to avoid blame -- for anything. It\\'s quite a departure from his pre-presidency definition of \"leadership.\" He wrote in a 2013 tweet, \"Whatever happens, you\\'re responsible. If it doesn\\'t happen, you\\'re responsible.\" Trump liked this so much, he ended up publishing the same phrase four times over the course of a couple of years. In fact, as regular readers may recall, before reaching the White House, the New York Republican had all kinds of thoughts about the importance of people in positions of authority taking the blame when things go wrong. In a 2012 tweet complaining about Barack Obama -- one of many such missives -- Trump wrote, \"He can never take responsibility.\" And yet, soon after taking office, he authorized a mission in Yemen, which claimed the life of Navy SEAL William \"Ryan\" Owens. \"This was something that was, you know, just, they wanted to do,\" the president said, referring to U.S. generals. \"They came to see me they explained what they wanted to do, the generals ... and they lost Ryan.\" Several months later, with most of his legislative agenda having gone nowhere, Trump said during a cabinet meeting, \"I\\'m not going to blame myself.\" Around the same time, the president resisted even acknowledging the deaths of four U.S. Army Special Operations soldiers who were killed in an ambush in Niger. Eventually, Trump commented on the Americans\\' deaths – but only to make clear that he didn\\'t authorize the mission. Early last year, after an extended government shutdown he was solely responsible for, Trump told reporters, \"The buck stops with everybody.\" It\\'s a posture he still can\\'t shake.

In September 2016, presidential candidate Donald Trump gathered evangelical pastors, whose support he had courted assiduously, to discuss the political beliefs that they shared. The Rev. Robert Jeffress, who leads the megachurch First Baptist Dallas and would preach at the church service Trump attended on the morning of his inauguration, recalls looking at the agenda and starting to discuss the first item. Trump interrupted him.  “Pastor, don’t you think we ought to pray first?” Trump said, according to Jeffress. As president, Trump has surrounded himself with a tightknit group of pastors like Jeffress, evangelical leaders who heap praise upon him for his socially conservative stances, his judicial appointments and his support for Israel’s government. Trump often invites these pastors to pray and seems to enjoy hearing their professions of faith. Many of the pastors insist that Trump is a Christian believer. But Trump — who recently mocked the expressions of faith of two devout politicians, the Catholic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the Latter-day Saint Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) — very rarely puts his own religious beliefs on display. He does not belong to a church in Washington, though he refers to himself as a Presbyterian. He only occasionally attends a service, including multiple visits to St. John’s Episcopal across from the White House, which past presidents historically have attended, and Christmas and Easter worship at the Florida Episcopal church where he was married or at Washington National Cathedral, another Episcopal church. The president says the Bible is his favorite book but has declined to name a verse that is particularly meaningful to him. And he has said multiple times that he does not like to ask God for forgiveness, which is traditionally seen as a core part of the Christian faith. Christians preach of the importance of evidence, or “fruit,” that shows that a person has had some kind of conversion moment. “If you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved,” reads a crucial text from the book of Romans. Once they have converted, Christians tend to take up certain spiritual disciplines, such as prayer, church attendance, tithing and reading the Bible. In interviews with several religious leaders and observers, there is no indication that Trump engages in any of those practices regularly. “Anybody who says ‘I’ve never asked for forgiveness’ is not in the born-again camp,” said Stephen Mansfield, an evangelical author who wrote books on the faiths of former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. Of Trump, he said: “Submit your life to Jesus, born again, conversion: that heart of Christianity is not something he has absorbed.” Still, a host of evangelical pastors whom Trump frequently invites to the White House tell their followers that the president is a Christian. “I think there’s no question he believes,” said the Rev. Franklin Graham, who has followed in the footsteps of his father, Billy Graham, as a faith adviser in the White House. Graham said he believes Trump has had a conversion moment, but he doesn’t know when it might have happened. Instead of an ecumenical faith advisory council, Trump chose to create an evangelical advisory board, with no members from Catholic, mainline Protestant, Jewish, Muslim or other traditions. Johnnie Moore, an unofficial leader of that advisory board, said Trump speaks “multiple times a week” with spiritual advisers including Graham, Paula White, Georgia pastor Jentezen Franklin and Texas pastor Jack Graham. “I absolutely believe he’s a born-again Christian,” Moore said. “I see it in things he’s said publicly and privately. I’ve seen it in his desire to stand up for what he believes is right.\" Many of Trump’s faith advisers, including White, who is now a part of his White House staff, declined to comment. Trump does not regularly talk about religion with many of his advisers, who said they knew little about how the president views God. Aides and supporters -- including the vice president -- have urged him to stop saying “goddamn,” a word particularly offensive to some Christians, and some have been perturbed by his use of profanity in the Oval Office. Some chafed at the questioning, saying it was a private matter. “President Trump is a man of God, and faith plays an important role in his life. The President values the close counsel of many in the faith-based community, as well as the daily prayers of the many Americans who pray for him, his family, our country, and our military. I have personally witnessed the President in worship many times and have also seen him use his faith and prayer to privately comfort and console Americans after a tragedy,” Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said in a statement to The Washington Post. Evangelical leader James Dobson has credited White with bringing about Trump’s Christian conversion. In the months before the 2016 election, Dobson told voters that Trump was a “baby Christian,” who might not have behaved as a religious man ought to earlier in his life but has since changed. Even though Obama regularly spoke of his faith and described how he converted to Christianity as a young man, many evangelical Trump supporters say they believe that Trump prays in the White House and that Obama did not. Last month, Trump became the first president to speak in person at the annual March for Life, an antiabortion event with religious overtones. Michael Capps, who brought his three children to the rally, said Trump had “put God back in the spotlight, which is amazing for the country” and was “the most religious” president ever. Trump, who was raised in the mainline Presbyterian tradition, does not have an evangelical background. He has cited a pastor he knew early in this life, the late Rev. Norman Vincent Peale, author of “The Power of Positive Thinking,” as influential in his worldview. He says the book helped him overcome bankruptcy. “His idea of religion was Norman Vincent Peale and making a lot of money,” said Tony Schwartz, who co-wrote Trump’s bestseller “The Art of the Deal,” spent time with him in the 1980s and is now a vocal Trump critic. “I never heard him use the word ‘God.’ He never cited any religious beliefs.” Peale officiated at Trump’s first wedding. The next two were also officiated by mainline Protestant ministers, one Presbyterian and one Episcopalian. First lady Melania Trump said in 2017 that she is Catholic. Most of Trump’s current relationships with evangelical pastors, particularly with believers in Pentecostal, charismatic and prosperity gospel strains of Christianity, appear to have developed only as he considered running for president. Trump also changed some of his beliefs in recent years, including his shift to oppose abortion. Several pastors, as well as two former White House officials, said they have never seen Trump pray in front of others. Instead, he regularly asks for Vice President Pence or for one of his many evangelical Cabinet members to pray. He does not regularly reference God in making his decisions, these aides say, and they have never seen him open a Bible. But he has long coveted the visual of having pastors pray for him, including the distinct image of the laying on of hands. Sean Feucht, a Christian musician running for Congress in California, attended a meeting in December organized by White, which brought about 50 Christian leaders, most of them Pentecostal, to the Oval Office. Trump asked the guests to pray for him. “It was bold, loud prayer” in the charismatic, Pentecostal style, Feucht said. “We were all praying at once, lifting our voices. It wasn’t solemn and organized. It was lively and loud. I think that he’s drawn to that.\" Trump was a silent appreciator, not joining in. The president’s first line to the pastors that day, before the prayer, was a jab at Pelosi for claiming to pray for him, Feucht said. Last week, Trump returned to that theme at the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event that is a prime opportunity for a president to talk about his faith. Speaking about Romney, who said his religious beliefs guided him in casting his vote against Trump during the impeachment trial, and Pelosi, who has said she prays for the president, Trump said: “I don’t like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong. Nor do I like people who say, ‘I pray for you,’ when they know that that’s not so.\" He rewrote his speech on his way to the prayer breakfast to include the barbs at Romney and Pelosi, White House aides said. Several aides said that Trump genuinely thinks the two members of Congress are falsely claiming to act based on faith, something they say the president would never do.     INDIANTOWN —\\xa0Donald Trump’s name is on everything from skyscrapers to golf resorts. In Martin County on March 5, sheriff’s deputies spotted it in a less posh place —\\xa0on a pill of the illegal drug MDMA, according to a recently-released report. Deputies reported stopping a Hyundai sedan at Southwest Trail Drive and Southwest Warfield Boulevard. Investigators said the vehicle had been traveling 72 mph in a 55 mph zone.  More: 82-year-old man pulls gun in ‘egging’ dispute  The driver and passenger, both 27, said they were going to a music festival in Okeechobee County. Deputies said the Hyundai smelled of marijuana, also known as weed, trees, pot, ganja, chronic, cheeba, reefer, jolly green, dope, bud, spliff, grass, herb and myriad other terms. Deputies reported finding various drugs, including alprazolam, cathinone and marijuana. Among the items investigators linked to the driver, a Miami resident, was a pill with “TRUMP” on one side and President Donald Trump’s face on the other. The driver “originally stated it was a Flintstones vitamin, but later admitted it was possibly MDMA,” a report states.

President Donald Trump denied on Friday that he was in any way responsible for his administration’s failure to make coronavirus testing widely available, and professed to have absolutely no idea who had disbanded the White House pandemic response team two years ago (John Bolton), or even if that had happened (it did).\\nThe president’s insistence that the buck very much does not stop with him was overshadowed by his false claim that Google had 1,700 engineers working to create a nationwide website that would direct Americans to testing sites nationwide.\\nOn Saturday, Trump appeared briefly at another news conference and revealed that he has been tested for the illness, Covid-19, after being exposed last weekend to at least two Brazilian officials who have subsequently tested positive.\\n  But Trump’s testy, wounded response to being asked on Friday if he shared the blame for the federal government’s halting effort to stem the spread of the virus is worth pausing on for a moment, because it suggests that he still has little idea, and less interest, in what happens in his own White House.\\nThe revealing exchange began when Kristen Welker of NBC News asked Trump about the lag in testing, which Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had described as “a failing,” the day before.\\n“Do you take responsibility for that?” Welker asked.\\n“Yeah, no,” Trump replied. “I don’t take responsibility at all.”   When Yamiche Alcindor of PBS NewsHour followed up by pointing out that Trump’s National Security Council had eliminated a team responsible for global health security, which was created by his predecessor to coordinate the response to pandemic threats, the president took offense and denied even knowing if such a thing had taken place.\\n“You said that you don’t take responsibility, but you did disband the White House pandemic office, and the officials that were working in that office left this administration abruptly. So what responsibility do you take to that?” Alcindor asked. “And the officials that worked in that office said that you, that the White House lost valuable time because that office was disbanded. What do you make of that?”     WATCH: @Yamiche asked the president about a reorganization of the National Security Council that dismantled a key pandemics team in 2018.

You say we did that, I don\\'t know anything about it.\" pic.twitter.com/lWo0YKS1rl  — PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) March 13, 2020    “Well, I just think it’s a nasty question,” Trump replied. “And when you say me — I didn’t do it. We have a group of people I could —”\\n“It’s your administration,” Alcindor interjected.\\n“I could ask perhaps,” Trump continued. “It’s my administration, but I could perhaps ask Tony about that, because I don’t know anything about it,” the president said, gesturing towards Dr. Fauci, who was not involved in disbanding the team, but had expressed regret that it was no longer there. “I mean, you say we did that. I don’t know anything about it,” Trump added.\\n“You don’t know about the reorganization that happened at the National Security Council?” Alcindor asked.\\n“It’s the administration. Perhaps they do that,” Trump replied. “You know, people let people go. You used to be with a different newspaper than you are now,” he said, referring, in confused terms, to the reporter having been hired by PBS, which is not a newspaper, from the New York Times, which did not fire her. “You know, things like that happen,” the president said, before the White House staff cut off the reporter’s microphone to make her next question inaudible.\\nMany observers assumed that Trump was feigning ignorance when he insisted that he had no idea that his White House had eliminated the positions of the health security and biodefense experts hired by the Obama administration to deal with pandemics. But there is evidence to support the more troubling possibility that he was telling the truth.\\nLast Friday at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Trump seemed entirely unaware that he had ever had such experts on his staff when Peter Baker of the New York Times referred to them in a question.\\n“Mr. President,” Baker said, “you said you had not anticipated this kind of thing happening. Would you rethink then having an office of pandemic preparation in the White House?”   “I just think this is something, Peter, that you can never really think is going to happen,” Trump replied, as if the question had been hypothetical. “You know, who — I’ve heard all about, ‘This could be,’ you know, ‘This could be a big deal,’ from before it happened. You know, this — something like this could happen. … But who would have thought, look, how long ago is it? Six, seven, eight weeks ago? Who would have thought we would even be having the subject? We were going to hit 30,000 on the Dow like it was clockwork, right? It was all going, it was right up, and then all of a sudden, this came out. … And the thing is, you never really know when something like this is going to strike and what it’s going to be. This is different than something else. This is a very different thing than something else.”\\n“But would there be a value in having an office in the White House that’s preparing for this?” Baker asked.\\n“Well, I just don’t think,” Trump responded, again not seeming to grasp the reason for the question. “I just don’t think that somebody is going to, without seeing something — like we saw something happening in China. As soon as they saw that happening, they essentially — not from the White House. I mean, you know, we don’t need a lab in the White House.”\\nLast month, when he was asked a related question\\xa0— if he now regretted budget proposals that called for enormous cuts to the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health, and and the World Health Organization —\\xa0Trump said no. “Some of the people we cut, they haven’t been used for many, many years, and if, if we have a need, we can get them very quickly,” he said. “And rather than spending the money — and I’m a business person, I don’t like having thousands of people around when you don’t need them — when we need them, we can get them back very quickly.”       Sign up to our Evening Headlines email for your daily guide to the latest news Sign up to our free US Evening Headlines email     Donald Trump has said he does not want everyone getting tested for coronavirus, while seeking to insist such testing would rapidly be available for those who required it. Formally announcing a national emergency in order to help combat the spread of the virus the has infected at least 1,900 Americans and killed more than 40, the president said the government was working with private companies to speed up the availability of testing – something over which he has faced intense criticism. He rejected criticism that he was responsible for the shortfall in testing, or access to test kits “We want to make sure that those who did a test can get a test very safely quickly and conveniently,” he said, speaking in the ground of the White House. “But we don’t want people to take the test if, if we feel that they shouldn’t be doing it. And we don’t want everyone running out and taking it – only those have certain symptoms.” The Trump administration has been criticised over its response to the virus and the president’s initial ability to play down its seriousness.  \\r\\n Earlier this week, Dr Anthony Fauci, who leads the national institute of allergy and infectious disease, admitted there had been a lag in testing. “The system is not really geared to what we need right now, what you are asking for. That is a failing,” he said on Capitol Hill. “It is a failing. I mean, let’s admit it.” The US has tested fewer than 12,000 people for the disease since January. In South Korea, authorities have been testing as many as 10,000 a day. The low figure has been attributed in part to logjams at medical facilities and faulty diagnosis kits, as well as a decision not to adopt a World Health Organisation-approved testing kit. “That’s partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak,” said Dan Diamond, a Politico health reporter who has been investigating the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. Speaking to NPR, he added: “The president had made clear – the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential re-election this fall.”  Mr Trump was asked whether he bore any responsibility for the shortfall in testing.  “I don’t take responsibility at all, because we were given...rules, regulations and specifications from a different time,” he said.   \\n  \\n Trump 2020 Sues \\'Washington Post,\\' Days After \\'N.Y.

Both pieces raised concerns that Trump had invited Russia\\'s help to boost his electoral fortunes. The lawsuit follows last week\\'s defamation suit against The New York Times over an opinion piece written by the paper\\'s former executive editor, Max Frankel, on the same subject.  The lawsuits dovetail with the president\\'s ongoing political strategy of targeting major media outlets as foes. The president is once more represented by the lawyer Charles Harder, known for helping to run media and gossip blog Gawker out of business. Harder previously represented first lady Melania Trump in securing settlements after filing defamation complaints against the Daily Mail and a Maryland blogger. Harder has also threatened litigation against major news organizations, including NPR, for other clients who were subject to critical coverage.  The lawsuit against the Post, filed Tuesday in federal court in Washington, D.C., alleges Trump was defamed in columns by the liberal commentators Greg Sargent and Paul Waldman. Both referred to remarks Trump made to ABC\\'s George Stephanopoulos in which he defended the idea of accepting damaging information about political opponents from foreign governments. \\n In Sargent\\'s case, he wrote that \"Trump and/or his campaign....tried to conspire with\" Russia\\'s interference in the 2016 elections. Waldman\\'s column asked: \"Who knows what sort of aid Russia and North Korea will give to the Trump campaign now that he has invited them to offer their assistance?\"  The president\\'s lawsuit refers to special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The suit maintains that the final report \"concluded there was no conspiracy between the [2016] Campaign and the Russian government, and no United States person intentionally coordinated with Russia\\'s efforts.\" The Mueller report did say it \"did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in the election interference activities.\" But it also concluded that \"the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.\" First Amendment scholars tell NPR that prominent public officials must meet a tough legal standard to win defamation cases, especially those involving opinion pieces. That\\'s even more true for the nation\\'s chief executive, who is expected to be subject to widespread public criticism and scrutiny.  However, publications can be held liable for incorrect statements of fact made within opinion columns in which publishers are believed to have acted with \"reckless disregard\" or \"actual malice\" as defined under the law. The New York Times is still defending itself in a defamation suit by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who was incorrectly linked to the shooting of then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in a 2017 editorial. The newspaper later corrected the assertion and tweeted an apology from its opinion section account. Its lawyers have called it an honest mistake. \\n The decision to have the Trump-Pence campaign sue on behalf of the president allows the president\\'s costs to be borne by a special account funded by donors. \\n  WASHINGTON — When intelligence officials briefed President Donald Trump on the most worrisome terrorist threats during the first two years of his tenure, they regularly mentioned the names of the senior terrorist figures the CIA was working hardest to find and kill, including the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahri. Trump would ultimately greenlight successful strikes on ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Yemeni al Qaeda chief Qasim al-Rimi — perhaps the most significant names on the CIA list of potential U.S. targets. But he was more interested in a young and less influential figure much farther down the list, according to two people familiar with the briefings, because he recognized the name.     \"He would say, \\'I\\'ve never heard of any of these people. What about Hamza bin Laden?\\'\" one former official said. \"That was the only name he knew,\" a Pentagon official added. Although Osama bin Laden\\'s youngest son was not believed to be planning attacks, the U.S. ultimately carried out an airstrike that killed him in 2018, according to current and former officials familiar with the matter. At first, officials weren\\'t sure of his fate, but in July, NBC News was the first to report that U.S. officials believed he was dead. An examination of the process that led to the strike against Hamza bin Laden puts a spotlight on how Trump has approached what is among the most weighty responsibilities of the U.S. president in the post-9/11 era: deciding which of America\\'s enemies should be marked for death. Trump\\'s recent decision to target Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani — in the face of intelligence suggesting that Iran would seek to retaliate for the Quds Force commander\\'s death by killing Americans — illustrates the high-stakes nature of such decisions. Improvements in weaponry and in the technology for finding targets have given this president lethal options his predecessors never had, but the greater freedom of action can make the decisions tougher. Yet Trump — who doesn\\'t read or digest detailed intelligence assessments, according to current and former officials — says he operates on instinct. \"I have a gut, and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else\\'s brain can ever tell me,\" he said in answer to a question about the economy during an interview in November 2018. \"The president\\'s highest priority is keeping Americans safe,\" said a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"He and his administration have successfully targeted the most dangerous and deadly terrorists in the world in order to protect the American people, including Hamza bin Laden, al-Baghdadi, Qassem Soleimani, and Qasim al-Rimi. These and countless other measures that have removed dozens of high value targets exemplify this administration\\'s resolve to defeat terrorism.\" The White House announced the successful strike on al-Rimi, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, on Feb. 7. He and Baghdadi, the ISIS leader killed in a U.S. commando raid that Trump authorized in October, were at or near the top of every intelligence priority list, officials say.     But former CIA official Douglas London, who led an agency unit targeting senior terrorists in 2018, said what he called Trump\\'s \"obsession\" with bin Laden\\'s son \"is one example of the president\\'s preference for a \\'celebrity\\' targeted killing versus prioritizing options that could prove better for U.S. security.\" In a piece for the website JustSecurity.com, which London says was reviewed and deemed unclassified by the CIA, he wrote, \"CIA had not overlooked the value in Hamza\\'s name recognition, nor his musings posted by al Qaeda\\'s media cell, but he was young, lacked battlefield experience, and had yet to develop a serious following.\" Few if any counterterrorism experts argue that Hamza bin Laden was not a lawful target. He was urging attacks on Americans on behalf of a terrorist group with which the U.S. is at war, and he was seen by experts as a possible future al Qaeda leader. But the CIA assessment at the time was that he was not next in the line of succession and was not a top threat, according to London and other U.S. intelligence officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Ayman al-Zawahri gives a eulogy for fellow al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in a video released on jihadist forums on June 8, 2011.SITE via AFP - Getty Images file  \"Despite intelligence assessments showing the greater dangers posed by Zawahri ... and the unlikelihood Hamza was in the immediate line of succession, the president thought differently,\" London wrote. \"He regularly demanded updates on Hamza and insisted we accelerate our efforts to go after him.\" Trump\\'s wishes \"necessarily influenced the alignment of the Intelligence Community\\'s focus and resources,\" London wrote in an unusual peek behind the scenes into the secret process of targeting terrorists. London suggested that politics may have been a factor in Trump\\'s decision-making. \"It was not lost on us working the issue that the president pressed hardest for results in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections,\" he wrote. The Pentagon, the State Department and various intelligence agencies had input into the process of nominating Hamza bin Laden for lethal action, according to a former senior U.S. official directly familiar with the matter. But Hamza bin Laden was not a top priority until Trump\\'s exhortations influenced the extent to which the CIA devoted scarce manhunting resources to tracking him, according to London\\'s account. Exile in Iran For a long time, Hamza bin Laden was an afterthought. In the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when the U.S. invaded Afghanistan, he was among bin Laden\\'s family members who made their way to Iran, where he lived for a number of years, some of them in detention, intelligence officials say. But in August 2015, al-Zawahri appeared in a video and introduced the younger bin Laden, calling him \"a lion from the den of al Qaeda.\" Bin Laden didn\\'t appear in the video, but he said in an audio-only part, \"What America and its allies fear the most is that we take the battlefield from Kabul, Baghdad and Gaza to Washington, London, Paris and Tel Aviv, and to take it to all the American, Jewish and Western interests in the world.\"  Protesters hold a photo of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani during a demonstration in Tehran on Jan. 3, 2020.Ali Mohammadi / Bloomberg via Getty Images file  He quickly became a fixture in al Qaeda messages, and counterterrorism officials took notice. The news media began reporting on the possibility that he was being groomed as a future terrorist leader. After the death of the senior bin Laden at the hands of Navy SEALs in Pakistan in 2011, and amid the rise of the Islamic State militant group, or ISIS, al Qaeda was struggling for relevance. By the time of his father\\'s death, officials believed Hamza bin Laden had relocated to the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. Still, during the Obama administration, there was little focus on Hamza bin Laden, three former senior officials said. He did not figure in intelligence assessments about the terrorist threat. \"I don\\'t remember a single meeting at which we focused on Hamza bin Laden,\" said Joshua Geltzer, who was the top counterterrorism official on the National Security Council until early in the Trump administration. A former senior counterterrorism official added: \"He had the name, but he didn\\'t have a lot of working relationships with people, and he didn\\'t have battlefield experience.\" In November 2017, the CIA released documents seized in the bin Laden operation, including a video of Hamza bin Laden\\'s wedding to the daughter of 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta. Fox News features Hamza Trump was president by then, and the video prompted a spate of television coverage. Fox News, a favored source of information for the president, devoted significant airtime to the release of the CIA documents and the video of the younger bin Laden. Inside the U.S. government — and among U.S. allies, according to a senior Western intelligence official — there was heightened concern that Hamza bin Laden could refresh al Qaeda\\'s ailing brand. But there was no evidence that he was involved in attacks or even inspiring them, experts say. \"It is not clear at all that Hamza presented an actual serious threat of inspiring attacks,\" said Seth Jones, a counterterrorism expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who advises the U.S. government. But Jones said he believes Hamza bin Laden was a justifiable target. Nonetheless, he said, \"I can\\'t remember a case where I\\'ve seen an interrogation of a terrorist who said he was inspired by Hamza bin Laden.\"   Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics   Last March, the U.S. government announced a $1 million reward for information helping to locate Hamza bin Laden. There was a consensus that such a step was warranted, officials said. Still, the size of the reward was telling. It paled in comparison to the $10 million offered for senior al Qaeda operative Saif al-Adel or the $25 million the U.S. had once offered for the senior bin Laden. \"Hamza bin Laden is wanted for questioning in connection with his membership in the al Qaeda organization and his public declarations threatening the security of the United States,\" the wanted poster said. But by then, officials now believe, Hamza bin Laden was already dead. Al Qaeda leader al-Zawahri and his top lieutenants are believed to be very much alive.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  President Donald Trump has expressed that he wants the number of coronavirus cases in the United States kept as low as possible, Politico reported Saturday evening.

The president is facing growing criticism over his administration’s failure to provide testing on a scale that could have limited the outbreak of Covid-19, with even Republicans in Congress speaking out. The US has tested fewer than 12,000 people for the disease since January. In South Korea, authorities have been testing as many as 10,000 a day. The low figure has been attributed in part to logjams at medical facilities and faulty diagnosis kits. But the US president is also reported to have been reluctant to launch a campaign of “aggressive testing”, which could have identified key outbreak areas. “That’s partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak,” said Dan Diamond, a Politico health reporter who has been investigating the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. Speaking to NPR, he added: “The president had made clear – the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential re-election this fall.” He said Mr Trump had failed to push for more urgent and widespread testing despite being warned by his health secretary Alex Azar that coronavirus threatened to become a “major” crisis. The president has repeatedly fixated on \"numbers\" during the coronavirus outbreak. Discussing the thousands of passengers stranded on a virus-hit cruise ship off the coast of California, he expressed concern that letting them come ashore could increase US case numbers. “I like the numbers being where they are,” Mr Trump said. “I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship.”\\u200b He has also compared the coronavirus death toll to that of common flu to provide a misleading picture of the new disease\\'s threat, tweeting: \"So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!” Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health, has warned coronavirus could be \"10 times more lethal than seasonal flu\". He also admitted on Thursday that the US was “failing” at testing, contradicting Mr Trump\\'s claims that “frankly, the testing has been going very smooth.” “The system is not really geared to what we need right now ... let’s admit it,” Dr Fauci told Congress.   Of all the topics to occupy the mind of the most powerful person in the United States, one would not expect badgers to make a frequent appearance. But the rotund, hairy omnivores were apparently an alarmingly regular topic of conversation in the White House during the early months of Donald Trump\\'s presidency, according to Daily Beast reporters Lachlan Markay and Asawin Suebsaeng. The authors detail Trump’s preoccupation in their new book, Sinking in the Swamp: How Trump’s Minions and Misfits Poisoned Washington. Along with detailing “the murky underworld of President Trump’s Washington, dishing the hilarious and frightening dirt on the charlatans, conspiracy theorists, ideologues, and run-of-the-mill con artists who have infected the highest echelons of American political power”, they also discuss Trump’s fascination with badgers. Over two pages, Markay and Suebsaeng explain that Trump would interrogate his former chief of staff Reince Priebus about the black, white and grey creatures. The questions would arise at such opportune moments as “when Priebus was attempting to brief the president on matters of healthcare initiatives, foreign policy, or Republican legislative agenda”, they wrote. “Are they mean to people?” Trump reportedly asked Priebus, perhaps thinking of badgers’ very long claws, which it uses to dig the burrows that make its home. “Or are they friendly creatures?” Trump would also demand to see photos of badgers, ask Priebus to give details on how badgers “work”, and wanted to know if they had a “personality” or were boring. Priebus was also called upon to explain “how the critters function and behave, what kind of food they like, and how aggressive or deadly they could be when presented with perceived existential threats”. ‘Obviously enthralled’ Markay and Suebsaeng said Trump would frequently derail important policy discussions with questions about the animals. \"An obviously enthralled president would stare at Priebus as the aide struggled for sufficiently placating answers, all the while trying to gently veer the conversation back to whether we were going to do a troop surge in Afghanistan or strip millions of Americans of healthcare coverage,\" they wrote. Trump did not specify which of the 11 species of badger he especially wanted to understand, but given he appeared to be obsessed with the animal due to its association with Priebus\\'s home state of Wisconsin, it was most likely the American badger – scientific name Taxidea taxus – that commanded his attention. Wisconsin is known as the “badger state” less for the animal– which is found in many US states – than for its mining history. In the early 1800s, iron ore miners in the state would live inside the caves they were digging, and became known as “badger boys” or “badgers”. The European badger, which is found in Ireland, lives in a system of underground tunnels and chambers called a sett. Some setts have a section that is used as a bathroom. – Guardian      Sign up for the daily Inside Washington email for exclusive US coverage and analysis sent to your inbox Get our free Inside Washington email     Donald Trump\\'s top three media targets for attacks are the New York Times, Washington Post and CNN – and now he is suing all three. After filing suits claiming the two major newspapers made false claims in articles, his re-election campaign has filed a suit against the cable network for a piece it says claimed \"the campaign \\'assessed the potential risks and benefits of again seeking Russia\\'s help in 2020 and has decided to leave that option on the table,\" Jenna Ellis, senior legal adviser to the president\\'s campaign, said in a Friday statement. \"Today the President\\'s re-election campaign has filed suit against CNN for false statements, claiming that The statements were and are 100 percent false and defamatory,\" she said. Last week, when asked about the Times piece, Mr Trump told a reporter he sued because it went beyond just an opinion. Ms Ellis said the campaign late last month asked CNN to retract the article and apologise, contending the network refused. The three lawsuits put a sitting US president against three of the country\\'s largest media outlets at a time each one will be covering his re-election bid.    https://sputniknews.com/20200314/trump-speaks-in-favour-of-refinancing-us-national-debt-slams-fed-chairman-for-bad-decisions-1078568585.html Trump Speaks in Favour of Refinancing US National Debt, Slams Fed Chairman for \\'Bad Decisions\\' Trump Speaks in Favour of Refinancing US National Debt, Slams Fed Chairman for \\'Bad Decisions\\' Trump repeatedly lashed out at the US Federal Reserve in 2019 for not doing enough in terms of cutting interest rates, arguing that the high rates were... 14.03.2020, Sputnik International 2020-03-14T16:40+0000 2020-03-14T16:40+0000 2022-11-15T08:46+0000  /html/head/meta[@name=\\'og:title\\']/@content /html/head/meta[@name=\\'og:description\\']/@content  https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/img/107856/87/1078568726_0:0:3096:1750_1920x0_80_0_0_399f632c91dfcb4edad46a4c154fb53b.jpg.webp  Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“  2020  Tim Korso https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/img/07e6/03/0d/1093831826_0:0:216:216_100x100_80_0_0_a108934716cb07f7466019e8f9d31d89.jpg.webp   Tim Korso https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/img/07e6/03/0d/1093831826_0:0:216:216_100x100_80_0_0_a108934716cb07f7466019e8f9d31d89.jpg.webp  News en_EN  Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“   https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/img/107856/87/1078568726_0:0:3096:1946_1920x0_80_0_0_b362d5914c26e560601da746da6a2c92.jpg.webp   Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“   Tim Korso https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/img/07e6/03/0d/1093831826_0:0:216:216_100x100_80_0_0_a108934716cb07f7466019e8f9d31d89.jpg.webp  us, newsfeed, coronavirus outbreak turns into pandemic, coronavirus  us, newsfeed, coronavirus outbreak turns into pandemic, coronavirus      16:40 GMT 14.03.2020 (Updated: 08:46 GMT 15.11.2022)  Trump repeatedly lashed out at the US Federal Reserve in 2019 for not doing enough in terms of cutting interest rates, arguing that the high rates were damaging the American economy more than the alleged discrepancies in trade with China.     Speaking at a presser on the coronavirus threat, President Donald Trump switched to the topic of the economy, saying that he would like to refinance the US national debt, which currently exceeds $23.3 trillion.\\n\"What I would like to do is, frankly, refinance our debt. We could refinance our debt very easily at a much lower rate. We have some tremendous opportunities right now\", he said.\\nPOTUS also used the opportunity to castigate Chairman of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell, arguing that he had made some \"bad decisions\". The president pointed out that he has the power to remove Powell from his post, but immediately clarified that he is not making that move at this time.\\nHe also lashed out at the Fed as a whole, claiming that they \"are not doing what they should be doing\" - namely lowering the interest rates. Trump stated that the US should not have interest rates higher than its \"competitor-nations\", bringing up Germany\\'s negative rate as an example.  \\nOn Countering the Coronavirus Threat\\nThe US president shared some updates on Washington\\'s strategy to combat the COVID-19 outbreak during the presser, saying that the UK and Ireland, which were previously exempt from the travel ban, would now be included in it.

He called on other businesses to follow the Cupertino-based tech firm\\'s suit.\\n \\nFollowing weeks of refusing to take a test for coronavirus infection, claiming that he was absolutely healthy, President Trump acknowledged that he had finally taken a test without elaborating on what prompted him to change his mind. He said that the results will become available in a day or two, but noted that he had a normal temperature when it was checked upon his arrival at the presser – a procedure that all journalists had to go through too.\\nNotably, the apparent shift in Trump\\'s attitude took place after it turned out that a member of a Brazilian delegation that POTUS met last week had tested positive for the coronavirus.\\n       \\nAccording to Trump\\'s top epidemiologist, Anthony Fauci – the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, some 2,226 people have contracted COVID-19 in the US, with 532 cases registered in just the last day.

Now, we will see more suffering and death predominantly … among the vulnerables in our society\", Fauci said.     WASHINGTON/GENEVA (Reuters) - President Donald Trump declared a U.S. national emergency over the quickly spreading coronavirus on Friday, opening the door to more government aid to combat a pathogen that has infected more than 138,000 people worldwide and left over 5,000 dead. The impact of the coronavirus on everyday life deepened around the world. It was detected for the first time in several countries, with the World Health Organization (WHO) calling Europe the pandemic’s current epicenter. More schools and businesses closed, the global sporting calendar was left in tatters, and people faced greater restrictions on where they could go. “To unleash the full power of the federal government to this effort today, I am officially declaring a national emergency - two very big words,” Trump said in remarks at the White House Rose Garden, adding that the U.S. situation could worsen and “the next eight weeks are critical.” Trump, whose action makes available $50 billion in federal aid to states and localities, had faced criticism from some experts for being slow and ineffective in his response to the crisis and playing down the threat. The latest steps came two days after Trump announced travel restrictions blocking U.S. entry for most people from continental Europe. While Britain was among the countries exempted, Trump said on Friday that might change because infections there had risen “precipitously.” The president, who was photographed last Saturday at his private Florida club with a Brazilian official who has tested positive for the coronavirus, said he himself likely would be tested “fairly soon,” a reversal of his previous stance. But Trump, 73, said he did not plan to isolate himself, noting he was suffering no symptoms. Travel bans have hammered airlines and travel companies worldwide, while financial markets have been hit by panic selling this week. The three major U.S. stock indexes rallied more than 9% on Friday, rebounding from Wall Street’s biggest daily drop since 1987. But the indexes were still about 20% below record highs hit in mid-February. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Europe now had more reported cases and deaths than the rest of world combined, apart from China, where the coronavirus originated but where new cases have slowed to a trickle. The WHO called the death toll reaching 5,000 globally “a tragic milestone.” The WHO’s top emergency expert, Mike Ryan, said social distancing was a “tried and tested method” to slow the spread of a virus but “not a panacea” that would stop transmission. “Blanket travel measures in their own right will do nothing to protect an individual state,” Ryan said. CULTURAL LANDMARKS More cultural landmarks were shuttered to try to stop the spread of the virus. In Paris, the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre museum and the Moulin Rouge cabaret closed their doors. The Smithsonian museums in Washington were preparing to do so on Saturday and Broadway theaters in New York went dark. The kissing of the Blarney Stone, one of Ireland’s oldest tourist traditions, was suspended. Central banks worldwide acted to shore up money markets after cratering share prices drove a rush for cash, hitting many regional currencies and threatening a surge in short-term borrowing costs. In China, which bore the brunt of the economic fallout from the coronavirus in the first few months of 2020, authorities late on Friday cut banks’ reserve requirements for the second time this year. The U.S. Federal Reserve followed suit with $37 billion of Treasury bond purchases, accelerating the enhanced market liquidity measures announced on Thursday. Japan’s central bank pledged to buy 200 billion yen ($1.90 billion) of five- to 10-year Japanese government bonds and also inject an additional 1.5 trillion yen in two-week loans. The European Union proposed a 37 billion euro ($41 billion)investment initiative as part of a package to cushion the bloc’s economies from the coronavirus impact. In Italy, which after China has been hardest hit by the respiratory illness, the death toll jumped by 250 to 1,266 in the last 24 hours, authorities said. The total number of cases also rose to 17,660 from a previous 15,113, despite draconian measures to restrict the movement of people. In the northern region of Lombardy, at the heart of Italy’s coronavirus epidemic, authorities asked for even stricter steps. In hard-hit Iran, security forces will empty the streets in cities across the country, state television reported. NEW COUNTRIES RECORD CASES The virus continued its persistent march across the globe. Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan and Guinea all confirmed their first cases, giving the disease a foothold in 18 countries on the African continent. Kosovo, Venezuela and Kazakhstan also confirmed their first cases, and Spain declared a state of emergency. World leaders, sports stars and actors were among the tens of thousands of people hit by the virus. Golf’s crown jewel, The Masters, England’s top-flight soccer Premier League, and the Boston and London marathons joined the long list of elite sporting events to be canceled or postponed. But sport’s biggest showpiece, the Olympics, will proceed as planned, according to Tokyo organizers.

Check out our most recent coverage of the coronavirus crisis, and subscribe to the  Mother Jones Daily  newsletter.  At a White House press conference on Friday, President Trump refused to take\\xa0any responsibility for the federal government’s lackluster response to the novel coronavirus, an infectious disease that’s sickened at least 142,000 people and killed more than 5,000 worldwide. After explaining, with the help of several CEOs, that widespread testing would be rolled-out, Trump took questions from the press corps. His basic response? Not my fault.\\xa0\\nSo far, nearly 1,900 people in the US have tested positive for COVID-19, the official name of the disease caused by coronavirus, and 41 have died. At least 30 states have declared states of emergency, school systems have shut down and moved to distance learning, professional sports leagues have put their games on hold, and the absence of a coherent policy from the government has created a contagion of fear and anxiety reflected in the plummeting stock market.\\nExperts largely agree that the lack of available tests makes determining the real number of infections nearly impossible, which has the effect of making it harder to slow the spread of infection. According to the Atlantic, approximately 13,000 people in the United States have been tested. By comparison, South Korea is testing 10,000 people per day. But, according to Trump, those low numbers are not his fault.\\n NBC News’ Kristin Welker asked the president if he is to blame for the lag in testing. “No, I don’t take responsibility at all,” he responded before quickly moving to his tried and true strategy: blame Obama. “We were given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time.”\\nBut that simply isn’t true. No remaining Obama-era regulation has prevented the administration from rolling out tests.\\xa0\\nTrump’s responsibility for the emerging crisis came up again when Yamiche Alcindor from PBS NewsHour asked about the dismantling of a pandemic-preparedness office that was once part of the National Security Council. “You said that you don’t take responsibility, but you did disband the White House pandemic office,” she said. “The officials that worked in that office said the White House lost valuable time because that office was disbanded.”\\n“I just think it’s a nasty question,” the president countered. \\xa0\\nThe National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense was established in 2014 during the Ebola outbreak in Western Africa and was tasked with preventing the next disease outbreak from becoming pandemic. In 2018, the Trump administration dissolved the office.\\xa0\\n“When you say me, I didn’t do it,” the president continued. “We have a group of people, I could ask, perhaps my administration.” He then turned to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. “Perhaps I could ask Tony about that? Because I don’t know anything about that.” Then, the president likened the dismantling of a White House office to changing jobs. “Perhaps they do that to people,” he said to Alcindor, who was a reporter at the New York Times before leaving for PBS. “You used to work at another newspaper. Things like that happen.”\\n\\t\\n\\t    WASHINGTON/BRASILIA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday said he was not concerned about the possibility of being exposed to the coronavirus after dining last week with a Brazilian government official who has since tested positive for the disease.    U.S. President Donald Trump awaits the arrival of Ireland\\'s Prime Minister, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at the White House in Washington, U.S., March 12, 2020. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst    The day after announcing curbs on travel to the United States by European Union residents, Trump brushed off concerns about his possible exposure to the virus, which has sickened more than 126,000 people in a worldwide pandemic. “Let’s put it this way: I’m not concerned,” Trump told reporters while meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in the Oval Office. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who had been at the dinner with Trump in Palm Beach, Florida, has been tested for coronavirus and is awaiting the result, his son Eduardo wrote on Twitter, adding that the president was not showing any symptoms. Brazilian officials on Thursday confirmed that Brazil’s communications secretary, Fabio Wajngarten, has the coronavirus and is now under quarantine at home. The entire Brazilian delegation that traveled to Florida with Bolsonaro is being tested for the virus, a senior member of the president’s staff told Reuters. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said Trump and Vice President Mike Pence had “almost no interactions” with the Brazilian official and that they “do not require being tested at this time.” She said the White House medical unit and the U.S. Secret Service are ensuring that “every precaution is taken” to ensure the good health of Trump and Pence, their families and staff. “We are monitoring the situation closely and will update everyone as we get more information,” she said. Bolsonaro and Wajngarten also visited the U.S. military’s Southern Command headquarters near Miami on Sunday. Southern Command said in a statement it had no reports of suspected or confirmed coronavirus infections among its personnel. The coronavirus pandemic and fallout is shaping up to be perhaps the greatest crisis of Trump’s presidency. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump’s bid for re-election in November, criticized the administration’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak on Thursday afternoon. Wajngarten had been on an official visit to the United States with Bolsonaro and posted a photo on Instagram of the meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club last Saturday, showing him standing next to Trump while wearing a “Make Brazil Great Again” cap. Pence was next to Trump. Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo reported that Bolsonaro’s test results were due on Friday. It added that other Cabinet ministers on the trip will also be tested. Two Republican U.S. senators who attended the visit by the Brazilian delegation said they would quarantine themselves. Senator Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, on Thursday said he had met with a member of Bolsonaro’s staff. “While I do not believe I interacted with the infected person, that individual was in the same room as me,” Scott said in a statement. “The health and safety of the American people is my focus and I have made the decision to self-quarantine.” U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close Trump ally, did not recollect direct contact with Bolsonaro while at Mar-a-Lago but would quarantine himself out of “an abundance of caution” and on his doctor’s advice, his office said in a statement. Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo, a federal congressman who also attended the meeting at Mar-a-Lago, wrote on Twitter that he was on his way to get tested. Four days ago, he posted a photo of himself standing behind the U.S. president, next to Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and close to his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Brazil’s foreign minister, defense minister and Brazil’s chief national security advisor were also in the image, along with the Brazilian president.

And Google – the company Trump said was developing the online platform – said it was not publishing a national-scale website; a health-based subsidiary of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is launching a small-scale website to begin triaging California-based patients only.\\n \\n \\n Trump went on to say he was allowing his health secretary to bypass certain regulations to provide more flexibility to doctors and hospitals responding to the outbreak.\\n \\n \\n And he announced he was waiving interest on student loans and purchasing more crude oil for the US strategic reserve to fill it “right to the top.”\\n \\n \\n \\n After a widely derided prime-time address on Wednesday that preceded a historic plunge in stocks, Trump faced pressure to demonstrate a handle on the crisis. Unlike that address, which framed the virus as a foreign threat, Friday’s statement pointed to a full-blown domestic crisis requiring massive federal resources. \\n \\n \\n He said the emergency action would “unleash the full power of the federal government” and called on Americans to band together in a time of national strain.\\n \\n \\n “Through a very collective action and shared sacrifice, national determination, we will overcome the threat of the virus,” he said.\\n \\n \\n But Trump’s own words at times belied a sense of political unity. He blamed Democrats for not bending enough in negotiations over a legislative package to combat coronavirus and he accused past administrations – misleadingly – of hampering his ability to confront the virus.\\n \\n \\n The delays in testing, however, have come under Trump’s watch and even Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease specialist, said this week the situation amounted to a “failing.”\\n \\n \\n Trump on Friday also claimed to lack any knowledge that a pandemic control group within his own National Security Council was disbanded under his watch, calling a question on the topic “nasty.”\\n \\n \\n “I don’t know anything about it,” he said. “When you say ‘me,’ I didn’t do it.” \\n \\n \\n The National Security Council’s global health directorate was folded into other areas of the council in 2018.\\n \\n \\n Even as he was announcing a scaling up of testing capacity for coronavirus, the President said Friday he did not believe all Americans should rush to be tested.\\n \\n \\n “We don’t want people to take a test if we feel that they shouldn’t be doing it. And we don’t want everybody running out and taking – only if you have certain symptoms,” he said in the Rose Garden.\\n \\n \\n One person he did suggest would take a test was himself, saying it was likely he would receive one “fairly soon,” after he recently came into contact with a Brazilian official who later tested positive.\\n \\n \\n If that encounter startled Trump into taking more protective actions to prevent himself from contracting or spreading the virus, however, it was not in evidence on Friday. During his event Trump shook hands with nearly every retail executive who came to his podium to speak, ceasing only when the final participant offered an elbow bump instead.\\n \\n \\n “I like that. That’s good,” Trump said.\\n \\n \\n The President, who began his remarks by giving himself plaudits for his response to the outbreak, still appeared to believe the spread could be limited even as he also suggested it would worsen before eventually improving.\\n \\n \\n “It could get worse. The next eight weeks are critical,” Trump said. “Some of the doctors say it will wash through, it will flow through. Interesting terms.”\\n \\n \\n Trump has been under pressure to take more decisive action as the virus begins altering everyday life for nearly every American.\\n \\n \\n \\n On Thursday, CNN reported that the President had decided to make the emergency declaration but that it was undergoing legal review at the White House.\\n \\n \\n Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, spoke to Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday and requested that the Trump administration declare an emergency to provide vital assistance to states such as Inslee’s that are on the front lines of the coronavirus crisis, a Washington state official told CNN.\\n \\n \\n The official told CNN they are “hopeful that (Friday’s) announcement will provide the kinds of assistance that the governor requested.”\\n \\n \\n White House aides have been weighing the move for the past several days as a way to provide more resources for combating the coronavirus outbreak. Trump has also been debating whether to support a legislative package to combat the outbreak negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and his treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin.\\n \\n \\n Trump signaled in the Rose Garden that he does not currently support the House Democrats’ coronavirus bill, which would – among other things – provide paid leave to Americans who can’t go to work during the pandemic.\\n \\n \\n “We just don’t think they’re giving enough. We don’t think the Democrats are giving enough,” he said.\\n \\n \\n The emergency declaration would free up funding and allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency to head certain aspects of the outbreak response.\\n \\n \\n Earlier this week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, in conjunction with Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington state and Gary Peters of Michigan, sent a letter asking Trump to “immediately” consider disaster declaration requests for the coronavirus.\\n \\n \\n CNN’s Jim Acosta, Kaitlan Collins and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.\\n\\n   At first, reports of an approach by the US president to secure “exclusive” access to a coronavirus vaccine were received with scepticism. As the major Italian daily newspaper La Repubblica noted, if true, Donald Trump’s bid to lure a German pharmaceutical company to the US was “a filthy proposal in times of pandemic”. Now German health officials have confirmed the story, which ran in the Sunday newspaper  Welt am Sonntag.

Germany’s Health Ministry later confirmed Trump had offered funds to lure CureVac to the US, CNBC reported, and said the German government was making counter-offers to ensure it stayed. The story has prompted considerable outrage in Germany, with public figures saying no country should have a monopoly on any future vaccine. One of CureVac’s biggest investors issued a statement on Sunday saying: “We want to develop a vaccine for the whole world and not individual countries.” ‘Germany not for sale’ There are more the 3,770 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US, with the nation’s capital alone, Washington DC, recording 42 deaths so far.

What is the coronavirus?   Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause a range of symptoms including a runny nose, cough, sore throat and fever. Some are mild, such as the common cold, while others are more likely to lead to pneumonia. The latest strain was discovered in the Chinese province of Wuhan.  How do you get coronavirus?  China says the virus is mutating and can be transmitted through human contact. It’s primarily spread through a sick person coughing or sneezing on someone but a person could also become infected through contact with the virus particles on a surface, NSW Health warns.  What are coronavirus symptoms?  Symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Most of those affected are older people and those with underlying health conditions.  How dangerous is the coronavirus?  The virus has caused alarm because it is still too early to know how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people.  How do you treat coronavirus?  As it stands, there is no vaccine for the virus and, because it is new, humans have not been able to build immunity to it. A group of Melbourne researchers have been tasked with finding a vaccine, while China is testing the HIV drug Aluvia as a treatment.  Where can I find further information on coronavirus?  There is a coronavirus hotline, 1800 020 080 The Coronavirus Health Information Line operates 24/7. The Federal Government’s Health Department also has a dedicated coronavirus page on its website.  How do I protect myself from coronavirus?   WHO’s standard recommendations:  Frequently clean hands by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water When coughing and sneezing cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue – throw the tissue away immediately and wash hands Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever and cough; Seek early medical help if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing.    On the night of 12 February, a group backing Donald Trump’s re-election hosted a glitzy gala for large donors at the Trump International hotel that featured the president. The Super Pac, dubbed America First Action, is no stranger to Trump’s Washington DC hotel. The Super Pac, which has raised almost $48m since 2017, has spent over $540,000 to host events at Trump’s hotel, making it a top source of campaign revenues for the hotel and the Trump family business, according to public data and 1100 Pennsylvania, which tracks Trump hotel events. Meanwhile, in mid-December, some mega-donors rented pricey rooms at the hotel for a two-day event hosted by Trump Victory, a fundraising committee for the president’s 2020 campaign, which also drew Trump and the vice-president, Mike Pence. The hotel also seems to have capitalized with high rates: the cheapest rooms on Saturday 14 December during the two-day meeting went for a whopping $6,719 compared with the usual rate of $500, according to the watchdog group Crew. Such lavish spending by pro-Trump political committees and their wealthy donors at his hotel highlights how the president, and his Republican allies in Congress, are using the hotel and other Trump properties to woo big donors as the 2020 money chase heats up. Thus Trump’s aggressive fundraising gives a nice boost to his real estate empire – which he never divested from – according to campaign watchdogs and public records. Trump’s businesses are literally making money off the 2020 campaign. Nor is it the first time. According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics (CRP), Trump-allied political committees and the Republican party have spent a whopping $18.1m at Trump properties since he launched his 2016 campaign. Republican candidates, elected officials and Pacs have ponied up another $1.2m in the same period. Donald J Trump for President leads the pack, having spent a total of $14.5m since he began his 2016 campaign, with the Republican National Committee in second place at $1.8m and Trump Victory ranking third at $1.6m, Center data shows. “The Trump era has given birth to a whole new level of political access and influence in Washington,” said Robert Maguire, the research director at Crew. “Wealthy donors and special interests get access to powerful people in President Trump’s orbit, including Trump himself, and in return, the donors not only boost Trump’s campaign, but enrich him personally by spending money at properties he still profits from.” The hefty campaign spending at the Trump hotel and other properties has yielded good dividends. Trump and the RNC have teamed up periodically to hold major fundraisers at the hotel. One early joint fundraiser in 2017 reportedly pulled in $10m, and in May 2019, soon after Trump formally launched his re-election campaign, a joint event brought in about $6m. Other Trump properties have witnessed more big donor traffic – with potential upticks in their revenues – as Trump seeks a second term. On 17 January, dozens of top Trump backers who had kicked in between $100,000 and $250,000 to help Trump win in 2020 showed up at Trump’s palatial Mar-a-Lago resort, where his 2020 campaign hosted a dinner with the president that also included policy roundtable talks and photo ops.   Not surprisingly, some elite donors have received extra attention from Trump at recent events, including the two-day December gathering hosted by Trump Victory, a joint committee between the campaign and the RNC. One donor who stood out was the oil and gas billionaire Harold Hamm, who runs a fossil fuel trade group that has held a few meetings at the Trump hotel. Hamm, who spoke at the 2016 GOP convention and has benefited from Trump’s deregulatory policies and pro-fossil-fuel stances, received a special shout-out from the president, according to a donor who heard Trump’s talk. Trump properties have also seen a nice boomlet as committees linked to key congressional allies, such as the Republican House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, have also spent big bucks to haul in campaign loot. McCarthy, for instance, teamed up with Pence to host a big fundraiser for their Protect the House Pac at the Trump hotel last October, which drew Trump as a guest speaker and pulled in about $13m, according to public records. Other McCarthy committees to benefit House members organized two bashes at the hotel in 2018. Altogether these events have generated over $200,000 in revenues for Trump’s hotel, campaign reports show. Likewise, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, hosted a big-money bash at Trump’s hotel last fall for his Senate Leadership Fund, an event Trump attended too. All the fundraising and influence-peddling at the Trump hotel, however, has had some embarrassing and painful consequences. In April of 2018, two Soviet-born Florida residents, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, attended a small dinner for donors to America First Action at the hotel with Trump, just weeks before they kicked in $325,000 to the Super Pac. Last October, Parnas and Fruman were arrested at Dulles airport as they were preparing to fly to Vienna and charged with making illegal campaign contributions from foreign sources. The two men have pleaded not guilty and prosecutors have signaled more charges are likely. America First has been cooperating voluntarily with prosecutors and has placed their donation in escrow. “The usual sprint for campaign cash, combined with the additional opportunity for personal profit, appears to have added to an environment of lax vetting, leading to concerns about foreign money and indictments for campaign finance violations,” said Sheila Krumholz, who leads the Center for Responsive Politics.   According to a report from Politico, beleaguered U.S. hospitals are pleading for help from Donald Trump\\'s administration as they are swamped with patients seeking care from the exploding coronavirus pandemic.  However, the president has been keeping his distance. Despite assurances from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma that help is on the way in the form of rolling back some regulations that may help ease the burden, hospital administrators claim her plans do too little. \"Hospital leaders say that the new announcements only touch the surface of their needs, as they worry about shortages of crucial supplies, risks to their workers and the possibility of an industry bailout as coronavirus patients swarm their facilities,\" the report states. \"An expert on an American Hospital Association webinar last month predicted as many as 1.9 million ICU admissions from the coronavirus outbreak over the next few months, swamping existing facilities. There are only about 100,000 ICU beds across the U.S. health system.\" According to Chip Kahn, head of the for-profit Federation of American Hospitals, \"I think there will be hospitals that could be pushed to the edge financially.\" The Politico report notes, \"Some hospital leaders have quietly floated that they’ll need federal funding to pay for rented hotels or other arrangements as their hospital wards are quickly overrun by the coronavirus outbreak,\" adding, \"The risk of failure is severe: Public health experts have warned that the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, which is in its early days, could be on track to resemble the increasingly dire situation in Italy, where patients have overwhelmed that nation’s health system. That’s left hospitals calling for extreme measures from the White House and scrambling to prepare emergency steps of their own while they wait for a response.\" Adding to their problems is the fact that leaders in the hospital industry have been unable to meet face to face with President Donald Trump who made a show of meeting with CEO\\'s representing the retail and financial sectors. \"But in the face of the looming crisis, hospital executives said that leaders were underwhelmed by their Wednesday meeting with Verma, who spent much of the hour-long session taking notes but failed to calm industry fears about swamped emergency rooms and medical supply shortages, according to three individuals with direct knowledge of the meeting. Vice President Mike Pence briefly joined the meeting but departed to join other officials as they worked to prepare the president for his Oval Office address,\" the report states. \"But hospital leaders haven’t had time alone with President Donald Trump — even as leaders of other health sectors, like the insurance industry, the pharma industry and the lab industry, have been granted extended face-to-face meetings with the president and Pence.\" You can read more here.  \\n\\t\\nThe president is worried about the ballot box in November, not the health of Americans\\n\\t  President Trump has demonstrated on several occasions that he views the coronavirus pandemic not through the lens of keeping Americans safe, but of how it will impact his re-election chances. He all but said as much last week, telling reporters that he’d rather keep passengers on a Grand Princess cruise ship who tested positive out of America because “he likes the numbers being where they are.”\\nThe same day, Dan Diamond of Politico reported on how Trump has “undermined his administration’s own efforts to fight the coronavirus outbreak” by “resisting attempts to plan for worst-case scenarios, overturning a public-health plan upon request from political allies and repeating only the warnings that he chose to hear.”\\nConsidering what we know about the president, none of this is surprising, nor was it surprising when Diamond told NPR’s Terry Gross on Thursday that Trump hasn’t been pushing for aggressive testing because he’s “made clear the lower the numbers on coronavirus … the better for his potential reelection this fall.”\\n\\nA previous tweet of this quote did not make it adequately clear that it is Trump who did not push for adequate testing, not Secretary of Health and Human Services Azar.

The cluster of confirmed cases, which all revolve around the US president’s private residence in Florida, have emerged in the past 48 hours.  The first of the three cases was revealed on Thursday, when a senior official from a Brazilian delegation which spent last Saturday at Mar-a-Lago with Mr Trump tested positive for the virus.  The official, Fabio Wajngarten, was photographed at the residence posing alongside Mr Trump and vice-president Mike Pence.  On Friday, a senior Trump campaign official revealed an unnamed donor who visited Mar-a-Lago on Sunday had also contracted Covid-19. The official said the donor did not interact with the president during the fundraiser.  \\r\\n Then overnight Brazil’s US embassy announced its charge d’affairs, Nestor Forster Jr, had tested positive. He was also in attendance at the dinner with Mr Trump.  Jair Bolsonaro, the Brazilian president, will now be retested for the illness following a negative test on Friday, Brazilian media reported.

Nelsinho Trad alongside Senator Marco Rubio, just days before testing positive for coronavirus  (Instagram)   Mr Trump told reporters on Saturday he has been tested but that results had not yet come back.  “There was somebody that they say has it. I have no idea who he is, but I take pictures and it lasts for literally seconds,” Mr Trump said on Friday.  “I did sit with the president (Bolsonaro) for probably two hours, but he’s tested negative, so that’s good.” Shortly after announcing a national emergency, Mr Trump took the unusual step of shaking the hands of several American business chiefs as he invited them to talk about how their corporations are pitching in to combat the crisis that has sent markets spiralling and workers into self-isolation.  \\n\\t President Trump is staring down the steepest crisis of his presidency and his handling of it could define his time in office.\\nThe coronavirus outbreak presents a test unlike any other Trump has faced thus far. Past crises — mass shootings, white nationalist riots in Charlottesville and government shutdowns — faded out of the news cycle over time or were swallowed up by political machinations.\\nBut the virus shows no signs of abating, and Trump and his administration are under constant scrutiny for their response.\\n“In something like this there are two central things that the public asks — am I going to be OK and what are you doing about it?” said Eric Dezenhall, a prominent crisis communications management consultant.\\nThe result has been a stress test for the Trump administration over the past few weeks, as public health officials have increasingly taken to the podium in the White House briefing room to convey facts and recommendations to the American public that have at times been eclipsed or complicated by the president’s rhetoric.\\xa0\\nTrump has at times adopted a more somber and serious tone when discussing the virus, but his tweets and misleading claims boasting of his own actions have been viewed as inadequate and distracting.\\n“I’m not sure this administration has the intellectual capacity or the strategic understanding to address this,” said a former State Department official who worked under the Trump administration and previous presidents. “I really do think this could end up being Trump’s Katrina where people finally begin to question his ability to govern.”\\nThe White House rejected criticism of the president’s handling of the public health crisis.\\xa0\\n“While the media and those on the Left want to spin up fear and create panic, this White House is working around the clock to protect all Americans from the Coronavirus,” White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said in a statement.\\n“As President Trump said this week, we are using the full power of the federal government and the private sector. The President took decisive action early on to close our borders to the source of the virus and it is because of his leadership and relationships that he has brought together government and private industry for unprecedented collaboration to curb the spread of the virus, expand testing capacities, and expedite vaccine development,” Deere said.\\nTrump has taken decisive action at various times to try and blunt the spread of the virus. He shut down travel into the U.S. from China and South Korea relatively early, a move that has earned praise from allies and public health officials.\\nHe has sought economic remedies to aid businesses and workers directly affected by the virus through executive action, and Trump on Friday declared a national emergency to free up additional funding and resources for the federal, state and local government to combat the virus. He also announced the administration would set up “drive-thru” testing sites in order to speed up testing.\\nBut the president spent weeks in February downplaying the threat, a decision that experts say cost precious time in galvanizing resources. In interviews and public appearances, he described it as “very well under control” and suggested the virus would dissipate once the weather warmed in April.\\nAs the number of U.S. cases began to increase, Trump on Feb. 26 delegated control of the federal government response to Vice President Pence, a move that was generally well received given Pence’s experience in government and serious approach.\\nBut Trump has been unwilling to entirely sideline himself, and his public commentary has at times been damaging to the effectiveness of the government response.\\nHe has continued to minimize the threat to the public, comparing the number of deaths in the U.S. favorably to other countries even as the U.S. number climbs each day.\\nDuring a trip to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevent on March 6, Trump walked around the facility in a red “Keep America Great” campaign hat and offered insights that at times contradicted public health officials. He suggested he was opposed to allowing a quarantined cruise ship to come ashore because it would increase the number of cases in the U.S.\\n“In any other circumstances people go, that’s Trump being Trump, but now you’re messing around with our lives,” Dezenhall said. “Now we are talking about our lives, now we are talking about an economic collapse. The antics not only do not work, they’re a source of outrage for audiences beyond his traditional critics.”\\nTrump’s Oval Office address this week was somber and serious, but his message was marred by three factually inaccurate statements about his administration’s response that created confusion and spooked investors.\\nMultiple former administration officials said they thought Trump appeared nervous and uncomfortable as he strained to read the prepared remarks, and they noted he failed to address critical subject matter like testing shortages and hospital capacities.\\xa0\\nAnd while he called for an end to partisanship, by Friday Trump was again taking aim at his predecessor, Barack Obama, blaming his administration for delays in testing and criticizing its handling of the swine flu.\\nThe virus outbreak comes in a presidential election year and during a period of unprecedented partisan divide in the country.\\xa0\\nA Quinnipiac University poll released this week found 43 percent of registered voters approve of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus while 49 percent disapprove. But those totals are split sharply along partisan lines, with 87 percent of Republicans approving and 83 percent of Democrats disapproving.\\nDemocrats, including presidential primary front-runner Joe Biden, have at times harshly criticized the president’s response to and words about the virus, prompting accusations from some that they’re trying to politicize the crisis.\\n“They’re falling right into the president’s hands here,” said Sam Nunberg, who worked on Trump’s 2016 campaign. “It seems to me that the president can easily argue that his opponents are wishing for the worst, betting on the worst and instigating public hysteria.”\\xa0\\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was the point person for negotiations with Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on a legislative response. Trump was sidelined in the talks and skipped an annual bipartisan St. Patrick’s Day luncheon where he would have had to sit with the Speaker.\\nThe president on Friday afternoon continued to express optimism, trying to portray his decision-making as ahead of the curve and telling reporters “I don’t take responsibility at all” for delays to testing the public.\\n“Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus and to help all Americans who have been impacted by this,” Trump said. “This will pass through and we’re going to be even stronger for it.”\\xa0\\nBut the coronavirus is in some ways uniquely problematic for Trump.\\xa0\\nIt requires empathy and understanding from a president who has struggled to display that quality for extended periods. It has demanded a whole-of-government approach after Trump spent years hollowing out agencies of career officials and replacing them with acting leaders because he liked the “flexibility” that offered.\\xa0\\nAnd public health experts say responding to the virus requires transparency from an administration dogged by its tendency to offer misleading or inaccurate statements.\\n“We pride ourselves on having a decentralized government, but in times of crisis you look to your federal government,” one former White House official said. “And if he’s not up to the task he’s going to take a huge hit.”\\n  President Donald Trump on Friday announced a new series of measures to combat the coronavirus and treat those who are affected, while pushing back on criticism that his administration was unprepared to confront the pandemic. Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, Trump declared a national emergency that could free up $50 billion to help fight the pandemic and said that he was empowering the secretary of Health and Human Services to waive certain laws and regulations to ensure the virus can be contained and patients treated. \"To unleash the full power of the federal government … I am officially declaring a national emergency,\" Trump said. \"Two very big words,\" he added. Trump said the action would \"open up access\" to up to $50 billion \"for states and territories and localities in our shared fight against this disease.\" Flanked by Vice President Mike Pence, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and other top federal officials and corporate executives from companies such as Walmart, Trump said that the ability to waive certain laws and regulations would allow for easier admission to nursing homes and end limits on the length of hospital stays and the number of beds available.     He announced that 1.4 million new tests for the coronavirus would be available next week and that 5 million would be available within the next month — although he added that \"I doubt we\\'ll need that\" quantity. He also said there were plans to allow \"drive-thru\" virus tests. In an unusual and lengthy news conference, a parade of business leaders took turns speaking after Trump — before the president and other federal officials made additional key announcements related to the administration’s coronavirus response.   Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak   Trump shook hands with several of those business leaders as he introduced them at the lectern — a breach of best practices recommended by public health experts across the United States. After the corporate leaders spoke, Trump and other officials finally announced additional measures to confront the pandemic, which included the waiving of interest on federal student loans and the purchase of “large quantities” of oil for the U.S. strategic oil reserve. Officials also said they would be offering guidance to suspend all visitations to nursing homes, with exceptions being made only for end-of-life situations. Nevertheless, the stock market — which had in recent days fallen 20 percent from its latest high, delving formally to bear territory — reacted favorably to the announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose steadily as Trump spoke and closed for the day up nearly 2,000 points, or 9.4 percent. Trump, seen in photographs to have been in close proximity with people who have since tested positive for the coronavirus, also suggested Friday he would “most likely” get tested for the disease.  \"Not for that reason, but because I think I will do it anyway,\" Trump said, when questioned by a reporter about standing next to an aide to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro at his Mar-a-Lago resort last weekend. Trump had hinted Thursday that he was strongly considering taking emergency action, telling reporters in the Oval Office that he was thinking of invoking the Stafford Act to declare a national emergency. A national emergency declaration from the president would effectively create access to billions in federal aid to help with the pandemic. Plans for the emergency declaration were first reported by Bloomberg News. Under the Stafford Act, an \"infectious disease emergency declaration\" by the president would allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide disaster relief funding to state and local governments, as well as federal assistance to support the coronavirus response. The law allows the agency to circumvent legal barriers to more quickly distribute such aid. Emergency declarations are most often used in the event of natural disasters, but can also be applied to disease outbreaks. The president had tweeted earlier about the Friday press conference amid the rapid spread of the virus and as the White House has scrambled to craft a strategy to shift Trump\\'s response to the outbreak, which had been focused on downplaying the threat and accusing the media of creating undue concern. Trump has come under increasing fire in recent weeks over his response to the outbreak while his administration weathered criticism for the lack of coronavirus testing being done compared with other countries. Asked Friday at his press conference by NBC News’ Kristen Welker whether he should take responsibility for the failure to disseminate larger quantities of tests earlier, Trump declined. \"I don\\'t take responsibility at all,” he said. Trump also responded testily to a question from another reporter about a decision made by the administration in 2018 to disband the White House’s National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense — a unit sometimes referred to as the White House pandemic office. Trump called the question “nasty” and replied, “I didn’t do it.” “You say we did that, I don\\'t know anything about it,” Trump said. In addition to having insisted for weeks that he had the outbreak under control, Trump has also propagated personal beliefs about the coronavirus that contradict those of veteran health officials and experts. As panic began to set in over the outbreak, Trump tried to quell the fears of Americans across the country by giving a speech from the Oval Office on Wednesday night. He announced that he would ban many foreign travelers from Europe for the next 30 days and offered a series of economic relief actions to help workers and companies deal with the outbreak. But his speech was met with swift pushback after he misstated several aspects of the policy and failed to propose any new action to combat the outbreak domestically. Health officials in recent days have sounded the alarm, warning the public that the outbreak is likely to get worse. Many major public events, including all NBA, NHL, MLB and Major League Soccer preseason games and Broadway shows, have been canceled this week, and Thursday saw the Dow\\'s worst day since the 1987 crash. Wall Street, however, rallied Friday, bouncing firmly back after lawmakers and the White House appeared close to finalizing an economic relief package to address the coronavirus pandemic.   The first case of coronavirus reported in Orange County is a man who told health officials he attended a brunch at Mar-a-Lago, but a health official couldn’t confirm to reporters whether President Donald Trump attended that event. New details surrounding the patient’s travel history were announced Saturday by Raul Pino, the Orange County health director at the Florida Department of Health, who was at a press briefing by government and local health officials about the state of coronavirus in the county. Pino said the 41-year-old may have contracted the virus in Palm Beach County, where he told officials he brunched at Trump’s resort but didn’t say whether the president was there at the time. The patient has since been placed in self-isolation along with his family. “We are tracing the contacts of this individual, and we believe that we have control of the situation at this point,\" Pino said. The state on Saturday night also reported that a person who had previously tested positive for COVID-19 has died. The individual was a 77-year-old male in Lee County. It is not a travel-related case. He is the fourth Floridian to die of COVID-19. The Orange County case brings the total number of cases in Central Florida to seven, as of Saturday evening. It includes one case each in Osceola and Seminole and three in Volusia. Another case is a 68-year-old woman from Orange County who was tested in California after returning from Asia and later died there. Gov. Ron DeSantis on Saturday announced a 30-day ban on visits to nursing homes, which also applies to assisted living facilities and adult group homes. “We’re taking measures to be able to keep this a manageable situation, \\'\\' DeSantis said. DeSantis acknowledged that the swiftly spreading coronavirus is now being communicated among individuals in Florida who have no history of foreign or domestic travel. He said that three people in Broward County who tested positive for the deadly disease could likely be cases of community transmission. The governor also said he wants the Trump administration to consider limiting flights to Florida from states with outbreaks of the coronavirus, such as New York and Washington state. “We’re seeing cases now where people clearly would’ve acquired it somewhere else in the U.S. and brought it here,” DeSantis said. “And I think New York, given Florida’s relationship with people and our population’s relationship with New York, you just have a lot of interaction.” DeSantis also ordered emergency management officials to be at Level 1, the highest level for emergency response. And he requested that 61 Florida passengers who were on a cruise ship where passengers were infected be released from their quarantine on a military base in Georgia. The residents will be tested again and asked to self-isolate when they return to Florida, he said. In Orange County, Pino and Yolanda Martinez, director of the Orange County Health Services Department, noted the amount of time local officials have had to prepare for a possible outbreak in Central Florida but said an uptick in cases is only “a matter of time.” “We actually are surprised that at this point of the epidemic, with the geographic position of our county … that we haven’t seen more cases,” Pino said. “We have to be alert, and of course as we increase our ability to test, we may find more cases.” OneBlood Senior Vice President Susan Forbes said public fears of COVID-19 could cause a shortage in the blood supply “unlike we have seen before” as business and school closings cause donation drives to cancel. “Blood donors are needed now more than ever,\" Forbes said. \"Every blood drive that’s canceled, every donor that does not show up puts the blood supply at risk.” Agencies across the region have taken measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Jail officials in Orange, Osceola and Lake counties recently shared with the Orlando Sentinel detailed plans to thwart the virus’ spread by suspending in-person visitations, inmate screenings and deep sanitation of facilities. In Orange County, Vice Mayor Emily Bonilla, who didn’t attend the press conference, announced in an email her office is self-quarantining until March 19 “due to recent travel and ‘cold-like’ symptoms.” She also noted she does not meet federal guidelines to be tested for COVID-19.    The Health Report   Weekly A weekly update on health news in Florida.  Mayor Jerry Demings told reporters that officials will hold periodic briefings as the Department of Health continues to test people for the virus and called on residents to “remain calm” in the coming weeks. “Together we will get through this storm that is occurring throughout our community,” he said. The U.S. House of Representatives passed an $8.3 billion emergency package to give families relief as businesses close and officials look to make testing for the virus free to anyone exhibiting symptoms. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act would also provide paid sick leave to workers affected by virus. The Senate is set to vote on the bill Monday. “With all of the many issues we’re dealing with … the safety and security of people is truly the No. 1 concern,” Rep. Val Demings said at Saturday’s briefing.

The evangelical assessment does come with some reservations. Only about 15% of white evangelicals, for example, say \"morally upstanding\" describes Trump \"very well,\" while another 45% say the term applies to Trump \"fairly well.\" Two-thirds of U.S. adults as a whole say that characterization fits him \"not too well\" or \"not at all well.\" The evangelical view of Trump stands out not just by its divergence from the broader U.S. opinion, but by its apparent disconnect from conventional standards. Almost two-thirds of white evangelicals see Trump as at least \"somewhat religious,\" despite his profanity, his sporadic church attendance, and his evident unfamiliarity with the Bible. \\n \\n \\n One explanation for white evangelicals\\' attachment to Trump is that they see him as a political ally. The Pew survey found that 63% of white evangelical Protestants believe their side has been \"winning politically\" under the Trump presidency. That\\'s a dramatic turnaround from 2016, when less than one in four white evangelicals saw themselves as on the winning side. The Pew results also show white evangelical Christians as showing support for a version of Judeo-Christian nationalism. More than 90% say they want their president to stand up not only for religious beliefs in general, but for their religious beliefs in particular, including biblical teaching. \\n \\n Nine in 10 white evangelicals say they want the Bible to have \"at least some influence\" on U.S. laws, according to the Pew findings. \"Two-thirds of them go a step further,\" notes Greg Smith, the associate director of religion research at Pew. \"They say that if and when the Bible conflicts with the will of the American people, the Bible should have more influence on the laws of the land.\"\\n  A Phoenix-area man has died and his wife was in critical condition after the couple took chloroquine phosphate, an additive used to clean fish tanks that is also found in an anti-malaria medication touted by Donald Trump as a treatment for Covid-19.   Banner Health said on Monday the couple in their 60s got sick within half an hour of ingesting the additive. The man could not be resuscitated at hospital but the woman was able to throw up much of the chemical. “Trump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure,” the woman told NBC. She said her advice would be: “Don’t take anything. Don’t believe anything. Don’t believe anything that the president says and his people … call your doctor.”   It’s unclear if the couple took chloroquine phosphate specifically because of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. “Given the uncertainty around Covid-19, we understand that people are trying to find new ways to prevent or treat this virus, but self-medicating is not the way to do so,” said Dr Daniel Brooks, Banner Poison and Drug Information Center medical director. “The last thing that we want right now is to inundate our emergency departments with patients who believe they found a vague and risky solution that could potentially jeopardize their health.” At a news conference last week, Trump falsely stated that the Food and Drug Administration had just approved the use of an anti-malaria medication called chloroquine to treat patients infected with coronavirus. Even after the FDA chief clarified that the drug still needs to be tested for that use, Trump overstated the drug’s potential upside in containing the virus. Chloroquine is obtained by prescription, and Banner Health is urging medical providers against prescribing it to people who are not hospitalised. The difference between the fish tank cleaning additive the couple took and the drug used to treat malaria is the way they are formulated. The man’s death came as the number of Covid-19 cases in Arizona spiked more than 50% in one day, from 152 on Sunday to 235 on Monday, according to the state health department. Pima county reported its first coronavirus death: a woman in her 50s with an underlying health condition. It was the third Covid-19 death in Arizona. Two men, one in his 70s and one in his 50s, both had underlying conditions. People have tested positive in 11 of Arizona’s 15 counties, including 139 cases in Maricopa county, the state’s most populous. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. For some, older adults and people with health problems, it can cause more severe illness including pneumonia. The vast majority recover.   \\n\\t\\n President Trump said Saturday that he took the test for the coronavirus\\xa0the previous night and would have the results in a few days, saying he did so because of questions from the media.\\n“I also took the test last night,” Trump told reporters during a news conference in the White House briefing room. “I decided I should based on the press conference yesterday.

Federal health officials have repeatedly pointed out that his timetable is off — that it will take at least a year — but his single-minded focus on warp-speed production of a new vaccine represents a striking philosophical shift. For years, Mr. Trump was an extreme vaccine skeptic who not only blamed childhood immunizations for autism — a position that scientists have forcefully repudiated — but once boasted he had never had a flu shot.

Instead, what’s happening right now with the coronavirus pandemic is the thing we should have been worried about. This is the crisis Trump was least prepared to manage. As we watch it play out, we’re witnessing how all of Trump’s character flaws, pathologies and managerial weaknesses are coming together to make the novel coronavirus — and the looming threat of an economic downturn — impossibly worse:  Trump’s White House is a mess. In any crisis, you want an organization that runs smoothly and communicates well internally. But the word used most often to characterize Trump’s White House may be “chaos.” He’s on his fourth chief of staff and sixth communication director. His White House leaks more than any in history, as aides jockey for position or distance themselves from screw-ups. Trump himself admits that he likes to set staff against one another, as though operating the government were like an episode of “The Apprentice.” “I like conflict,” he says. “I like seeing it, and I think it’s the best way to go.”  Trump values loyalty over competence. “I expect loyalty,” Trump reportedly told then-FBI Director James B. Comey not long before firing him. We’ve seen it again and again: Officials who put the interests of the country or the requirements of their job over personal service to Trump, like Jeff Sessions, earn his ire and are eventually shown the door, while fervent devotees are rewarded. The Post reports that he has tasked a close aide with assembling a list of insufficiently loyal officials so they can be purged. And one of the first things he did in office was to hire his daughter and son-in-law for top positions.   Follow\\xa0Paul Waldman\\'s opinionsFollow  Needless to say, that doesn’t get you a government of the most skilled and experienced people who can handle a crisis when it comes. It gets you a collection of yes men, many of whom won’t be able to do the job that’s demanded of them.    Trump may think he can sugarcoat coronavirus, but media critic Erik Wemple says it is time for the government to speak with one clear voice about public health. (Video: The Washington Post, Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)    So Trump’s televised address on the crisis was written by Jared Kushner and Stephen Miller, without the input of public health experts. Not surprisingly, it was full of factual errors and reassured no one.  Trump distrusts expertise and experts. One of the running themes of Trump’s presidency — and his whole life — is that people with education, training and experience are idiots who know nothing, and that he knows more than them about the area of their expertise. He says this constantly.  On a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, he said, “Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability.” So when an expert tells him something he doesn’t want to hear, he’s ready to just decide it’s not true, because he’s the ultimate authority on everything.  Trump can’t tell the truth, and must always say everything is great. From the beginning of the crisis, Trump insisted everything was under control, his administration was doing a spectacular job, and it would all be over soon. When he announced his task force, he claimed that “we’ve had tremendous success,” there were only 15 people infected, and that “within a couple of days” that would be \"close to zero.” Even if Trump were not already the most dishonest politician in American history, this kind of thing would have destroyed his credibility. So at moments when the public needs to trust that our government will not lie to us, Trump has no ability to reassure us or prepare us for what we have to do.  Trump’s relentless need to attack his opponents renders him unable to unify the country. At a moment when a president ought to be calling the country to common purpose, Trump is spending his days insulting Democrats on Twitter and blaming his own shortcomings on Barack Obama. That’s hardly all. We could discuss Trump’s inability to plan for the future and lack of concern for any problem that isn’t staring him in the face. (In 2018, he disbanded the White House team responsible for preparing for pandemics.) We could talk about his penchant for conspiracy theorizing, which is not unrelated to the fact that he prefers to get information from Fox News rather than from government officials. We could go into his relentless and pathetic need for compliments and affirmation. Whenever one of his political appointees goes on TV to discuss the crisis, every other sentence they utter is a tribute to his magnificent leadership, because they know their jobs depend on enthusiastic lickspittlery. Or we could consider that his top priority is never what’s happening to the country but instead how it’s making him look, which has led him all along to downplay the severity of the pandemic. But what it adds up to is that we’ve never seen a president less equipped to handle a crisis on this order, or more likely to turn it into a cataclysm. I began by noting that when Trump was running for president in 2016, many warned inaccurately that if he was elected, he might start a nuclear war. There was another group, perhaps even larger, who said, “Sure, he’s kind of a joke, but why not give him a shot? What’s the worst that could happen?” Now we’re finding out.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas    WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has tested negative for coronavirus, the president’s physician, Sean Conley, said in a statement on Saturday. The president decided on Friday to take the test for the virus, which has killed some 5,800 people worldwide, and received the negative result on Saturday evening, Conley wrote in a memo that was released by the White House. The test came days after the president stood next to a Brazilian official who was tested positive for the virus. Trump was photographed at his private Florida club standing next to Fabio Wajngarten, the press aide to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, when Brazilian officials visited last week. Wajngarten later tested positive for the disease. “One week after having dinner with the Brazilian delegation in Mar-a-Lago, the president remains symptom-free,” Conley said in his memo. “I have been in daily contact with the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and White House Coronavirus Task Force, and we are encouraging the implementation of all their best practices for exposure reduction and transmission mitigation.” Because of a U.S. effort to slow the spread of the virus, which disproportionately kills older people, schools have been closed, museums shuttered and many employees have been urged to work from home to practice “social distancing.” The virus has killed more than 50 Americans. It has infected more than 154,000 people worldwide and killed some 5,800 since it emerged in China in December.

       "' \\n Donald Trump golfing. (Photo via Twitter)\\n    According to a report from Politico, Donald Trump\\'s grand ambitions for his post-presidency are floundering during his \"exile\" to his Mar-a-Lago resort. The former president was expected to play kingmaker in the Republican Party as he made plans for his political comeback, but aides close to the president and former White House officials are now saying his post-presidency is directionless and that his \"barebones\" staff is trying to keep him relevant.  According to Gabby Orr and Meredith McGraw, \"His vow to target disloyal Republicans with personally-recruited primary challengers has taken a backseat to conventional endorsements of senators who refused to indulge his quest to overturn the 2020 election. And though he was supposed to build a massive political apparatus to keep his MAGA movement afloat, it\\'s unclear to Republicans what his PAC is actually doing, beyond entangling itself in disputes with Republican icons and the party\\'s fundraising arms.\" One person close to Trump lamented, \"There is no apparatus, no structure and part of that is due to a lack of political understanding on Trump\\'s behalf.\"   GOP strategist Matt Gorman agreed, adding, \"It\\'s like political phantom limbs. He doesn\\'t have the same political infrastructure he did three months ago as president.\" The report states that it hasn\\'t helped that the former President has been keeping himself out of the spotlight, with the previously voluble Trump rarely commenting on his successor Joe Biden and making few pronouncements. \"The cumulative result is political whiplash, as the former president shifts from wanting to support the GOP with his resources and grassroots appeal one day to refocusing on his own brand and thirst for vengeance the next,\" the report states. \"Trump has always been an impulsive figure who demanded loyalty from those around him. But those traits have come with positions of power: whether atop a real estate empire, as a media celebrity, or — in his last iteration — as president of the United States.No longer occupying a powerful office, the task has been made more complicated.\" Politico adds, \"He has assembled a barebones staff of paid and unpaid advisers who say they are working to vet primary candidates seeking his support and get his fundraising operation off the ground. But the factions that have already formed among those surrounding him suggest potential turbulence ahead. Three veterans of Trump\\'s 2020 campaign — Brad Parscale, Bill Stepien and Justin Clark — have been screening primary recruitments and brainstorming ways to reestablish his online presence, while Dave Bossie and Corey Lewandowski are in talks with the ex-president to launch a new fundraising entity on his behalf, according to people briefed on the recent discussions.\" Summing up Trump\\'s post-presidential kingmaking efforts, one former White House official admitted, \"You\\'ve got Trump making endorsements of people without going through the process he agreed to three days ago. It\\'s really disorganized.\" You can read more here.   \\nEx-president Donald Trump finds himself adrift while in political exile. And Republicans, and even some allies, say he is disorganized, torn between playing the role of antagonist and party leader.\\n“There is no apparatus, no structure and part of that is due to a lack of political understanding on Trump’s behalf,” said a person close to the former president, noting that Trump has struggled to learn the ropes of post-presidential politicking. \\n“It’s like political phantom limbs. He doesn’t have the same political infrastructure he did three months ago as president,” added GOP strategist Matt Gorman, who previously served as communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee.\\nThe version of Trump that has emerged in the month and a half since he left office is far from the political godzilla many expected him to be. He was supposed to unleash hell on a party apparatus that recoiled when his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 and declined to fiercely defend him during his second impeachment. Instead, Trump has maintained close ties to GOP officials who have committed to supporting incumbents, stayed almost entirely out of the spotlight, delivered fairly anodyne remarks the one time he emerged, and offered only sparse criticism of his successor, Joe Biden. \\nThe cumulative result is political whiplash, as the former president shifts from wanting to support the GOP with his resources and grassroots appeal one day to refocusing on his own brand and thirst for vengeance the next. In the past week alone, Trump has gone from threatening party bodies for using his name and likeness in their fundraising efforts to offering up his Mar-a-Lago estate as a host site for part of the Republican National Committee’s spring donor retreat. He savagely attacked veteran GOP operative Karl Rove for criticizing his first post-presidency speech at the annual Conservative Political Action Committee, and endorsed Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), who repeatedly scrutinized Trump’s own trade practices while in office. \\nAnd in the span of two weeks, Trump went from endorsing his first primary challenger to an incumbent Republican by throwing his support between former White House aide-turned-congressional candidate Max Miller to hosting a vocal opponent of insurgent primary challenges, Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., for dinner at Mar-a-Lago. In his role as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Scott has promised to stick by GOP incumbents — including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who voted to convict Trump in his Senate trial last month on charges of inciting an insurrection. The Florida Republican said he had a “great meeting” with Trump in a tweet he shared Friday. \\n“For any normal politician, it would look like he’s trying to have it both ways but really he’s trying to have it his way,” said a former Trump White House official. “He only cares about maintaining his power and his stranglehold over the Republican Party and it doesn’t matter to him how any of the moves he makes affect the long-term success of institutions or individuals other than himself.” \\nTrump has always been an impulsive figure who demanded loyalty from those around him. But those traits have come with positions of power: whether atop a real estate empire, as a media celebrity, or — in his last iteration — as president of the United States. \\nNo longer occupying a powerful office, the task has been made more complicated. The former president has appeared to settle into life outside the confines of the West Wing, and even made his first trip to New York earlier this week. He continues to hold court on the patio of his Mar-a-Lago resort where he is greeted by a standing ovation from members when he and the former first lady walk by. He spends his days monitoring the news, making calls and playing golf at his eponymous club just a few miles away. \\nHe has assembled a barebones staff of paid and unpaid advisers who say they are working to vet primary candidates seeking his support and get his fundraising operation off the ground. But the factions that have already formed among those surrounding him suggest potential turbulence ahead. Three veterans of Trump’s 2020 campaign — Brad Parscale, Bill Stepien and Justin Clark — have been screening primary recruitments and brainstorming ways to reestablish his online presence, while Dave Bossie and Corey Lewandowski are in talks with the ex-president to launch a new fundraising entity on his behalf, according to people briefed on the recent discussions.\\nAt the same time, Trump has continued to phone pals from his real estate days and former White House officials — soliciting their counsel on which Republicans he should try to unseat and whether they approve of the primary challengers he’s considering. One former administration official who has been in contact with Trump described him as a “pinball,” noting that his tendency to abruptly change directions or seize on a new idea after speaking with a friend or outside adviser — a habit that often frustrated aides during his time in office — has carried into his post-presidency life. \\n“You’ve got Trump making endorsements of people without going through the process he agreed to three days ago,” said the former White House official. “It’s really disorganized.”\\nThe fear among Republicans is that Trump’s indecisiveness will extend to his personal political future as well. Trump has continued to dangle a 2024 run over the party, and the will-he-won’t-he guessing game has held presidential hopefuls in limbo. \\n“Politics is his hobby and he’s having fun with his hobby in between his rounds of golf,” said a former Trump adviser. “His big test is does he run again? Because if he doesn’t, you’ll see people lose interest in the guy in the next hour. As long as he plays the theatrics he’s going to run again, he still garners attention and creates headlines.”\\nBut stripped of a social media platform like Twitter, the former president has had to rely on issuing statements — some mimicking the tone and length of his past tweets — via his post-presidency office or political PAC press lists. So far, he’s issued more than two dozen endorsements and statements since leaving the White House. The more recent ones have bashed Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and sought credit for the current Covid-19 vaccine distribution. \\nAnd while Trump, an avid cable news consumer, has avoided publicly responding to TV segments that are critical of him or the wave of recent “cancel culture” headlines, he’s been tempted. Before a Wednesday appearance by his senior adviser Jason Miller on the “War Room” podcast hosted by former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, Trump told Miller he could “make a little news” by relaying the ex-president’s thoughts on last Sunday’s bombshell Oprah interview of Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle. \\n“When I was talking to the president this morning… he’s like, ‘Yeah, she’s no good. I said that and now everybody’s seeing it. But you realize if you say anything negative about Meghan Markle you get canceled. Look at Piers,’” Miller said, recounting his conversation with Trump, who had been referring to Piers Morgan, the polarizing “Good Morning Britain” host who parted ways with the show this week after dismissing Markle’s revelations as lies. \\nSome close aides have described Trump’s hiatus from Twitter as a welcome break that allows his rare statements to carry more weight than the thought bubbles he would release on the internet. \\nBut so far, many of his recent political maneuverings have been met with a shrug by the GOP. Trump’s public tussle with the Republican Party over fundraising and the use of his name and likeness in appeals for money appeared to fizzle out after attorneys for the Republican National Committee denied Trump’s cease-and-desist demands. By week’s end, the RNC was not only still using Trump’s name in fundraising solicitations, it was offering him up as an enticement. \\n“Want to meet President Trump?” a fundraising appeal read, touting the opportunity to dine with the former president at an upcoming spring retreat and even “take a photo” with him too.  \\n   So, who do you think of when the needle goes into your arm? Who do you blame when your jabbed shoulder aches at night? The 45th\\xa0president of the United States of America, Donald Trump, would like for you to think of him. In a statement distributed Wednesday by his “communications team,” Trump said the following: “I hope everyone remembers when they’re getting the COVID-19 (often referred to as the China Virus) Vaccine, that if I wasn’t President, you wouldn’t be getting that beautiful ‘shot’ for 5 years, at best, and probably wouldn’t be getting it at all. I hope everyone remembers!”  Oh, how we remember. We remember the half-million Americans dead; we remember the superspreader events, the mega-rallies and the White House gatherings hosted by the then-president; we remember his disregard of his own health experts and his mockery of masks. We remember the White House press briefing when Trump said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation to wear a mask was “voluntary. I don’t think I’m going to be doing it.”    White House press secretary Jen Psaki on March 12 praised science for the record coronavirus vaccine development. (Video: The Washington Post)    And we remember that Trump himself contracted the coronavirus and was transported to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center while the country discussed whether Vice President Mike Pence should begin rehearsing the presidential oath. We remember, too, the many blunders and endless disinformation emanating from the White House while infection and death rates steadily rose unabated. And, not least, we recall Trump’s ruminations on the possible curative benefits of bleach injections. Apparently, the former president feels he’s not receiving enough credit — or attention — for the vaccines currently going into 2 million American arms a day under President Biden. What with Twitter and Facebook now beyond his reach, Trump has no audience to satisfy his insatiable appetite for praise and applause. “Thank Trump” has been trending this week on Twitter, however, suggesting that his supporters have taken up the cause. On Fox News, Sean Hannity has said that Biden should call Trump and thank him.   Follow\\xa0Kathleen Parker\\'s opinionsFollow  Therefore, whereas and henceforth, let it be resolved that Donald J. Trump created an exemplary public-private partnership, propelled by a $14 billion federal investment under the rubric Operation Warp Speed, to create vaccines and treatment in record time. For this, he deserves credit and, if you wish, praise and applause. It’s just too bad that a vast number of his constituents aren’t planning to take advantage of the vaccines and have refused throughout the pandemic to wear a mask or to take other precautionary measures. These aren’t necessarily the same people who launched an attack on the Capitol in January, but a Venn diagram likely would reveal some overlap. Not surprisingly, Trump has said or done little to enlighten them about the need to get with the program. When all other living former presidents — Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter — recently joined an Ad Council campaign urging skeptics to get the vaccine, Trump was notably missing. Even though both he and Melania Trump received vaccinations in January at the White House, no be-like-me photos were shown that might have encouraged others to do the same. A PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll released Thursday found that 41 percent of Republicans — and 49 percent of GOP men — said they wouldn’t get vaccinated. By comparison, about 87 percent of Democrats surveyed said they would or already had received the vaccine. Only 11\\xa0percent of Democrats said they wouldn’t get the shot. Some people don’t like any kind of injection or, in this case, view the vaccine as more hurried than miraculous. Others apparently would rather risk contracting the virus than help Biden meet his ambitious goals. During his first national address since Inauguration Day, on Thursday night, Biden announced that he will direct states to make every adult eligible for vaccination by May 1. He predicted that July 4, 2021, would be a day to gather and celebrate not only the nation’s independence but also its independence from the deadly virus. Biden’s footnote of caution that variants or other circumstances could spoil the party was essential. But it didn’t dampen his overall tone of hope mixed with empathy for those suffering or lost to covid. While his dignity, humility and sincerity were balm for the soul, they were also plainly irksome to hard-right diehards devoted to Trumpism at any cost. Alas, there seems to be no antidote for snake oil.

Jennifer Weisselberg, the former daughter-in-law of the Trump organization’s chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, recalled the incident in a profile of Cyrus Vance Jr., the Manhattan prosecutor who is considering charging the former president and real estate mogul on tax, insurance and banking fraud charges. The incident took place before her 2004 wedding to Barry Weisselberg. Trump arrived at the shiva at a modest Long Island home and declared, “This is where my C.F.O. lives? It’s embarrassing!” He then showed the photos of the women. “After that, he starts hitting on me,” Jennifer Weisselberg said of Trump, and complained that her future father-in-law “didn’t stand up for me.” Jennifer Weisselberg, who divorced Barry Weisselberg in 2018, described the relationship between her former father-in-law and his boss at a time when Vance and others are considering whether the elder Weisselberg would “flip” and testify against Trump. She said Weisselberg “has more feelings and adoration for Donald than for his wife.”     Vance’s team has interviewed Jennifer Weisselberg in part because she recently revealed that she and her husband lived rent free in a Trump property. If Barry Weisselberg did not declare the property as income, he may be subject to tax evasion prosecution, which would be a means for Vance to squeeze his father into testifying against Trump.

Conservative political commentator and author Nick Adams tweeted that Mr Trump \"is looking better than ever before!! He’s getting in shape for 2024 and the liberals are freaking out!!\" He was subsequently mocked by Talking Points Memo founder Josh Marshall who tweeted that Mr Trump looked \"confused, anaemic and like 100 ... seriously what’s wrong with these people. This is like the 10th Trumper today tweeting how Trump is looking amazing\".  Vox journalist Aaron Rupar made fun of Mr Adams\\' comments by juxtaposing his comments with an image of dead Russian revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin.    Follow Trump and Biden news live: President speaks out on Cuomo    Mr Marshall added that it was \"sort of unreal that the former prez is basically working as a greeter at a club in Florida,\" as images of Mr Trump posing with supporters at the club emerged.  Podcaster Tom Joseph said Mr Trump\\'s eyes were \"vacant\" and \"dead,\" adding that \"his appearance is dreadful. His degenerative neurological disease has reached a point where he is brought out as a novelty item for Republican dog and pony shows\".  Mr Rupar added to the mockery by comparing conservatives adoring point of view of the former president to Homer Simpson\\'s delusions over his own appearance.  Conservative author and anti-Islam activist Birgitte Gabriel said Mr Trump \"looks fantastic and stronger than ever!\" Despite the pushback, she doubled down on her praise, further tweeting: \"President Trump is looking ENERGIZED and ready to go for 2024!! This is what \\'Presidential\\' looks like!!\" She added that Mr Trump is \"losing weight and getting in great shape, and it’s driving the left absolutely mad\".  Tim Fullerton, director of digital strategy at the Interior Department during the Obama administration, sarcastically tweeted: \"I truly wish I could look this amazing. So fit and so in shape. I’m drowning in my liberal tears over here.\"          Hundreds of mostly maskless guests pack the ballroom at Mar-a-Lago on Dec. 18, 2020, for Turning Point USA\\'s annual winter gala.    PALM BEACH, Fla. – The lobby of the Trump Hotel in Washington – loyalists\\' favorite schmoozing ground during Donald Trump\\'s presidency – has been replaced by the former president\\'s invite-only gilded private club, Mar-a-Lago. From GOP leaders to congressional lawmakers to donors to prospective political heir apparents, a steady stream of callers and wooers has descended on the Palm Beach club in the past few weeks. All seek Trump\\'s blessing and support – and money.  More:  Latest Trump news, photos, videos  The question of how much clout Trump would retain after leaving office, and how he would wield it, has been answered. In less than two months, Trump has established himself as the GOP\\'s king- and queenmaker – drawing some of the Republican Party\\'s top influencers. \"The majority of the party is with him,\" said Miami-based GOP strategist and podcast host Gianno Caldwell. \"It\\'s unquestionable at this point that they are absolutely with him.\"  More:  Trump, DeSantis favored for president in 2024 by CPAC attendees  Although Trump\\'s banishment from social media has left him unable to broadcast and boast online about his new role, news reports and posts to social media by others have confirmed Trump is holding court at Mar-a-Lago. Unlike Trump\\'s hotel in Washington, which is open to the public, Mar-a-Lago is a private club, and only those hand-selected by Trump are allowed in. Mar-a-Lago has become a lucrative destination for fundraising The Republican Party struggles with how it will handle Trump\\'s efforts to remain a player in politics as GOP strategists plan efforts to retake Congress and deepen the party\\'s grip on state capitals. Mar-a-Lago is a lucrative fundraising destination – for both GOP organizations and Trump. Since 2018, the Republican National Committee has spent more than $290,000 at Mar-a-Lago events that helped the party raise millions. The RNC will spend even more in April when it hosts its annual spring retreat dinner for major donors at the former president\\'s club, according to The Washington Post. The RNC decided to hold the dinner at the former president’s private club to accommodate Trump, the headline speaker, and guests who would like to visit the club, according to the Post. The RNC\\'s apparent effort to steer Trump toward détente by moving its dinner to Mar-a-Lago and inviting Trump to speak did not work. The intra-party divide took a brow-raising twist March 5 when Trump\\'s lawyers sent out cease-and-desist letters to the RNC, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee demanding they no longer use his name and likeness on fundraising emails and merchandise, according to Politico. The three GOP groups are the largest fundraising organizations focused on electing Republicans to state and national offices. Trump: Donate to his movement, not the GOP On March 9, Trump\\'s Save America PAC sent out a statement saying that although Trump \"fully\" supports the Republican Party, he would \"not support RINOs (Republicans in name only) and fools, and it is not their right to use my likeness or image to raise funds.\" The statement called on the Trump base to \"donate to our Save America PAC\" to help \"the America First movement.\" The RNC denied Trump\\'s cease-and-desist demand but agreed not to use his name or image to raise money without his permission, though the committee sent out an email last Wednesday inviting donors to contribute to the party for a chance to meet the president at the spring retreat in April. Caldwell said that despite the support for Trump among party leaders, donors and elected officials, there is widespread evidence of fault lines within the conservative movement. \"The party is fractured, so it\\'s going to be very difficult to unite the party in a way which is cohesive for legitimate forward movement,\" said Caldwell, host of the Outloud With Gianno Caldwell podcast on iHeartRadio. Caldwell said that split was clear at Trump\\'s highly anticipated return to the political stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando late last month. Caldwell noted that although a straw poll found 97% approval for Trump\\'s performance as president, 55% said they would support him 2024 if he were to run again.  More:  Trump is headliner at CPAC in Orlando. But really it\\'s conservative Florida\\'s coming-out party  Caldwell said many conservatives applauded his public policies and straight talk during his term at the White House, but others cringed at his statements, concluding that they \"were despicable and something a president should never say.\" And many, at least privately, hold Trump responsible for the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, Caldwell said. Whether they are with him or not, Caldwell said, many conservatives feel they have targets on their backs. \"It is a tough, tough road considering where the country is now,\" Caldwell said, citing media coverage and social media bans. \"Because conservatives are legitimately getting beat up everywhere. This is a really, really rough place to be because there is also a lack of leadership in the GOP right now.\"   Trump in Palm Beach: Follow our Facebook page  \"The Republican Party is being eaten alive from within by this,\" said Spencer Critchley, a Democratic communication consultant who advised Barack Obama\\'s presidential campaign. \"He is doing all this stuff that only serves his own impulsive interest of the moment and the Republican Party seems helpless to do anything but go along with it, even though he is attacking one of the things they presumably care most about, their ability to raise money.\" Trump is the \\'de facto ideological leader\\' A top fundraiser for Trump and Republicans said Trump is the undisputable leader of the party and the clear choice among most for the presidential nomination in three years.        From left, U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.; lobbyist Pam Bondi; animal welfare advocate Blair Brandt; and Lara Trump, the former president\\'s daughter-in-law, attend a fundraiser Feb. 8, 2019, in Palm Beach, Fla., to support the Humane Society\\'s efforts to find homes for greyhounds, such as Bart, a racing dog saved from being euthanized after he broke his leg.    \"You can\\'t underestimate he is the de facto ideological leader of the party,\" said Blair Brandt, a political consultant in Palm Beach and former Florida co-chair of the Trump Victory Finance Committee. \"He is the presumptive front-runner for 2024 at this time.\" If Trump does not run again, he will probably handpick the party\\'s next presidential candidate, Brandt said. \"I think that everyone who is doing this now is smart because this is like down time for him,\" Brandt said. \"There will come a time when his availability will shrink.\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was the first lawmaker to make the pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago – eight days after the presidential inauguration of Joe Biden on Jan. 20.  More:  Why upstart political \\'sommelier\\' Blair Brandt says GOP money base is Palm Beach  A statement issued by Trump’s Save America PAC said the men discussed strategy for winning the majority of House seats in next year\\'s midterm elections. A parade of other GOP politicians followed. On Feb. 16, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., stopped by, according to Politico Playbook. Scalise, a longtime Trump supporter did not join other top Republicans, including McCarthy, in rebuking the former president after the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida and Lauren Boebert of Colorado were at Mar-a-Lago on Feb. 20 for a $10,600-per-couple fundraiser for Utah Sen. Mike Lee, according to a photo of the invite tweeted by Politico reporter Marc Caputo. Also that weekend, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was at Mar-a-Lago. Like McCarthy, Graham had been critical of Trump after the Capitol attack. Graham did not say whether he raised the incident with Trump during their discussion of the 2022 elections and efforts to unite the Republican Party, according to a report by The Hill. Trump\\'s senior campaign adviser Steve Cortes showed up for the fundraising weekend Feb. 20. The following weekend, Richard Grenell, Trump\\'s former acting national intelligence director, had dinner with Trump on the terrace at Mar-a-Lago. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton posed with Trump at the former president\\'s golf club in West Palm Beach. Some visits do not \\'go well\\' Former U.S. Sen. David Perdue, the Georgia Republican who lost a runoff election Jan. 5, called on Mar-a-Lago in late February and announced afterward that he would not run again in 2022. The meeting “did not go well,\" according to a tweet by New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman based on unnamed sources. \"Perdue had dinner with and played a long round of golf with Trump last week. It did not go well. Two ppl briefed on the meetings said Trump was very focused on McConnell and Kemp and retribution. One person close to Perdue says that wasn’t related to his decision,\" Haberman\\'s tweet read, which referred to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp.

One person close to Perdue says that wasn’t related to his decision. — Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) February 23, 2021    Perdue cited personal reasons for not pursuing the seat. Trump has endorsed a handful of Republicans in the 2022 election: Sarah Sanders, his former press secretary, for governor of Arkansas; Jerry Moran of Kansas for U.S. Senate; incumbent Tim Scott of South Carolina for Senate; and Max Miller of Ohio for the U.S. House. \"There\\'s no question that he\\'s picking winners and losers and not just for his own ego,\" Brandt said. \"It\\'s actually politically effective right now.\"  More:  After 2020 fraud claims, Donald Trump requests mail ballot  The fundraising and treks to Mar-a-Lago will continue, Brandt said. It makes sense to be seen with Trump and host events at his club. Other GOP donors with deep pockets live in Palm Beach, and \"everyone needs a winter vacation,\" Brandt said. \"If Trump was living in Macon, Georgia, you would be going there to see him, but here, people are not just meeting with him but also donors who typically participate at the six-figure level and above,\" Brandt said. This month, Donald Trump Jr. and girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle hosted a fundraiser for South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem at Mar-a-Lago, per an invite obtained by Daniel Lippman for Politico.  More:  Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle turn to Palm Beach Gardens enclave for new home  Trump may also be wielding Mar-a-Lago as a form of payback. In mid-February, Trump snubbed a request from Nikki Haley, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to meet with him at Mar-a-Lago, according to Politico Playbook. Haley, a potential presidential hopeful and former governor of South Carolina, was critical of Trump after the Capitol riot.        Mar-a-Lago, former President Donald Trump\\'s private club in Palm Beach, continues to be a popular destination for Republican fundraising.

Especially when those are the business dealings of former United States President Donald J. Trump. Prosecutors at the Manhattan district attorney\\'s office are looking for information pertaining to possible illegal activity by Trump and his businesses. To that end, they are trying to get Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization\\'s chief financial officer, to turn on the organization. Because of this, stories about the interactions between Trump and Weisselberg have come to light, including an interesting story about Trump at a solemn event.

According to the report, prosecutors spoke with Jennifer Weisselberg the former daughter-in-law of the CFO.  She recounted an instance when she met Trump at the shiva for Weisselberg\\'s mother in the early 2000s. According to Jennifer, Trump was rude from the moment he arrived.  She said:   \"Trump showed up in a limousine and blurted out, \\'This is where my C.F.O. lives? It\\'s embarrassing!\\'\"  However, that wasn\\'t the worst part. Next, Jennifer explained Trump spent his time showing attendees photographs of naked women on yachts and hitting on her. The shiva is a period of mourning in the Jewish religion.

According to a report from Politico, supporters of former President Donald Trump are being flooded with robocalls from at least one political action committee (PAC) asking for donations to advance his political comeback with none of the money going to the one-termer who has a PAC of his own. The report notes that one such PAC, Campaign to Support Republican Leaders, is promising that a $100 donation will help to pay to get Trump back on Twitter. There is one problem with Campaign to Support Republican Leaders: they are not registered with the government and not one dollar will go to Trump. \"A donation of $100, for example, would help return Trump to Twitter. Or, for a similar amount, a potential donor can \\'stop Kamala Harris and socialism,\\' the calls claim. Other calls ask for money to ensure that congressional Democrats don\\'t dismantle the wall Trump started building along the U.S.-Mexico border,\" Politico\\'s Theodoric Meyer wrote. \"One of the telemarketers behind the calls, who spoke to a POLITICO reporter on Wednesday, promised that \\'100 percent of the contributions go directly to President Trump.\\'\" According to an official Kelly Sadler, a spokesperson for the Trump-endorsed America First super PAC, this is not the first time they have had problems with scammers.    \"There\\'s nothing we can do to stop them. This is a problem for the campaign, as well as us, as well as for the RNC,\" Sadler explained. As for the most recent scam, Politico\\'s Meyer wrote, \"One telemarketer said he was calling from the 33rd floor of a Dallas office building — a building which is home to a WeWork office that\\'s been linked to a man named Matthew Tunstall,\" adding, \"Tunstall is the treasurer of the Support American Leaders PAC, which lists its address as the same Dallas WeWork office on Federal Election Commission forms. Another telemarketer on the recent robocalls identified the group behind it as the Campaign to Support the President. That group, too, lists Tunstall as its treasurer on FEC forms.\" The report goes on to note that the Support American Leaders PAC successfully pulled in \"$2.5 million during the 2020 cycle. Less than $375,000 was spent on ads and voter contact supporting Trump,\" adding, \"none of it went to Trump\\'s campaign.\"   The report noted that Tunstall did return a call requesting a comment.

It said that following the release of a recording between Donald Trump and Georgia’s top elections investigator that it had misquoted the former president. “ Trump did not tell the investigator to ‘find the fraud’ or say she would be ‘a national hero’ if she did so,” The Post wrote.  In order to acknowledge this, we have amended our headline to make it clear that this was an allegation, and added this update to state the latest position.    Donald Trump allegedly pressured Georgia’s top elections investigator to “find the fraud” in a phone call last month, as the president continued in his attempts to overturn president-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the state.   The Washington Post  reported that Mr Trump made the call on 23 December as the investigations chief for the Georgia secretary of state’s office pursued allegations of ballot fraud in the suburbs of Atlanta. Citing people familiar with the call, the Post \\xa0reported Mr Trump allegedly told the official that they would be a “national hero” if they found evidence of fraud. In later reporting, The Post acknowledged that the ‘hero’ comment was not in fact made. However, he did tell the investigator that she had “the most important job in the country right now”, the Post added. The president has made at least three separate calls to state officials in Georgia seeking to overturn or complaining about the results of November’s presidential election. In this instance, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger had launched an investigation to determine if election officials in Cobb County accepted mail-in ballots that did not match those on file. Mr Trump’s call came as inquiries were underway. The allegations were eventually determined to have no merit. Mr Raffensperger confirmed to the Post \\xa0that Mr Trump made the call in December but was not aware of the details of what was discussed. He did say it was inappropriate for the president to attempt to intervene in an investigation. The first known incidence of Mr Trump speaking with Georgia officials regarding the election was in early December when he criticized Republican Governor Brian Kemp for certifying the state’s results. During a 2 January call, the president both threatened and flattered Mr Raffensperger in an attempt to get him to overturn the election results. Audio of the conversation was made public. On the recording, Mr Trump told the secretary of state: “Go find me some votes.” Legal experts have flagged the call as a possible violation of state or federal law. The Post’s source says that the 23 December call was similar to that made to Mr Raffensperger. No evidence of widespread voter fraud was found in Georgia or any other state. President-elect Joe Biden became the first Democrat to win Georgia \\xa0since 1992 with 49.5 per cent of the vote with a count of 2,473,633 ballots. Mr Trump lost Georgia by 11,779 votes.  The Independent has contacted the White House for comment.   Throughout the two long months that Donald Trump spent in post-defeat denial, numerous theories circulated regarding what his big post–White House plans would entail. At the time, the leading assumption was that Trump would stick to his strengths and go all-in on a media venture, perhaps becoming the creator of his own news network. Others wondered if he would continue leading and reshaping the conservative movement by forming a Trumpian third party, or targeting GOP lawmakers who voted for his second impeachment. But since leaving the White House, his future plans appear to be at a standstill, despite continuing to be the most influential Republican in the country. While he did continue his multiyear run as CPAC’s keynote speaker last month and is still asking supporters of the “America First” movement to contribute to his ill-defined Save America PAC, Trump has not made any concrete moves aimed at advancing his political ambitions. For one, his plan to enlist primary candidates to unseat the Republican lawmakers on his bad side––either because of their role in his latest impeachment or because of their refusal to help in his failed effort to overturn Joe Biden’s victory––appears to be going nowhere. The former president has no “no apparatus, no structure” at the moment, one source tied to Trump told Politico. “Part of that is due to a lack of political understanding on Trump’s behalf,” the person added, explaining that Trump is struggling to effectively wield his political capital now that he is out of the White House. A former White House official under Trump also told the publication that his old boss is showing the party his true colors. “For any normal politician, it would look like he’s trying to have it both ways but really he’s trying to have it his way,” they said. “He only cares about maintaining his power and his stranglehold over the Republican Party and it doesn’t matter to him how any of the moves he makes affect the long-term success of institutions or individuals other than himself.” Trump’s goldfish-like inability to commit to a specific course of action is a major disordering factor, namely in hurting his efforts to lead insurgent primary campaigns against his perceived enemies. Another ex–Trump administration official told Politico that Trump is like a “pinball” right now. “[Trump is] making endorsements of people without going through the process he agreed to three days ago. It’s really disorganized,” they said. His lack of direction notwithstanding, Trump has continued to make his issues with the party leadership known while using his popularity with voters to his advantage. Shortly after demanding that the Republican National Committee stop using his name and likeness to fundraise––a request that the RNC said it would ignore––he turned around and asked supporters last week to donate directly to his PAC. In a statement, Trump lashed out at the “RINOS [Republican in name only] and fools” and insisted that “it is not their right to use my likeness or image to raise funds,” adding that “they do nothing but hurt the Republican Party and our great voting base—they will never lead us to Greatness. So much money is being raised and completely wasted by people that do not have the GOP’s best interests in mind.” For Republicans who are still close with him, Trump remains a vital key for their electoral hopes. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his former press secretary who is running in Arkansas’s upcoming gubernatorial race to unseat the state’s sitting GOP governor Asa Hutchinson, advertised her visit with her old boss over the weekend, sharing a picture on social media of the two at a campaign event. “Another great weekend on the campaign trail featuring a surprise appearance at one of my events by President Trump!” she wrote on Instagram. Trump released a statement of his own cosigning Sanders’s electoral hopes. “Sarah is strong on Borders, tough on Crime, and fully supports the Second Amendment and our great law enforcement officers,” he wrote. “She loves our Military and Veterans—and her home state of Arkansas. Sarah will be a GREAT Governor, and she has my Complete and Total Endorsement!” Though Trump’s media presence has been fading since leaving office—and losing his Twitter megaphone—the Biden administration could still use the former president’s sway with the MAGA faithful to assist in the nation’s ongoing mass vaccination effort. On Monday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki asserted that “if former President Trump woke up tomorrow and wanted to be more vocal about the safety and efficacy of the campaign, of the vaccine, certainly we’d support that.” Psaki, who has acknowledged polling that shows Republican men are among the most likely to oppose receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, made the comments just after Biden shrugged off the need for Trump’s help. “I discussed it with my team and they say the thing that has more impact than anything Trump would say to the MAGA folks is what the local doctor, what the local preachers, what the local people in the community would say,” the president said. “So I urge all local docs and ministers and priests to talk about why, why it’s important to get that vaccine, and even after that, until everyone is in fact vaccinated, to wear this mask.”  More Great Stories From  Vanity Fair \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 — How Will Kellyanne and George Conway Move On in a Post-Trump America?— Mayoral Hopeful Andrew Yang on His Plans for New York City — Inside Team Biden’s Freak-Out Over Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s Trump Jokes— Beto O’Rourke Wants to Save Texas From Ted Cruz — What the Hell Is Going on With Bitcoin?— Marty Baron Dishes in a Wide-Ranging Exit Interview — On With the Show!

The one-term GOP president will be presented with a framed copy of the declaration at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Mr Trump, who was impeached a historic two times while in office, has been staying at his Palm Beach club since leaving office in January. The framed copy will be delivered to Mr Trump by former state representative Perry Hooper Jr , who proposed the resolution, according to reports. The resolution passed unanimously by the state party’s executive committee stated that Mr Trump was one of “the most effective Presidents in the 245-year-history of this Republic”. It cited Operation Warp Speed for delivering “safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines in record time”, the “largest tax cuts and reforms in American history”, withdrawal from “the job-and-trade-killing Trans-pacific Partnership and NAFTA”, and appointing “three constitutional conservative justices to the US Supreme Court”. Mr Trump kept a low-profile after his departure from Washington DC, but re-emerged at the end of February to give hi first public speech at the right-wing CPAC conference.

Now it is in danger of becoming a white elephant. Clobbered first by the coronavirus pandemic, then by its owner’s election defeat, the Trump International Hotel in Washington is reeling from a huge loss of income and prestige. For critics of the former US president, it is welcome proof of how quickly the city is moving on without him.   “It used to be the hub of Trump World but I can’t imagine who goes there now,” said Sally Quinn, a local author and journalist. “We don’t even have tourists yet in Washington. I can’t imagine most people staying there when they come. I don’t know anybody who goes there or has gone there.” The hotel opened amid protests in the historic Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, between the White House and US Capitol building, in September 2016 as Trump campaigned for the presidency. For four years its opulent lobby thronged with diplomats, lobbyists and Trump family members. It was one of the few places in the US capital where “Make America great again” hats were bountiful. But one recent afternoon it seemed more reminiscent of the haunted hotel in Stanley Kubrick’s film The Shining.  Steel barriers surrounded the magnificent facade with its five US flags and statue of first postmaster general Benjamin Franklin. A black-coated porter explained that, due to coronavirus restrictions, only people invited by guests are allowed in. When the Guardian called the front desk, a man who identified himself as the manager said, “I’d rather not comment. Thank you for your call,” then hung up.    Danish Rozario, left, wheels a guest’s baggage down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Trump Hotel in Washington on 15 January 2021. Joe Biden’s inauguration five days later marked an ominous moment for the hotel’s fortunes. Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP  The hotel in Washington made just $15.1m in revenue last year, a drop of more than 60% from the year before. Then came Trump’s election loss and impeachment for inciting a deadly insurrection a short distance away at the US Capitol on 6 January, inflicting huge reputational damage. On 20 January, Trump boarded the Marine One helicopter to start a new post-presidential life at his luxury Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, depriving the hotel of one of its biggest draws. A week later, the New York Times reported that the lobby was largely vacant and the waiters and staff members outnumbered the customers. There was little mourning in Washington itself, where Joe Biden secured 92% of the vote compared with Trump’s 5%. Beyond official duties, the 45th president was rarely seen around the city, hardly ever visiting museums or theatres and only ever dining out at the Trump hotel itself. Last month the Washingtonian reported that table 72 in a round booth at the hotel’s steakhouse was perpetually reserved for the president in case he decided to visit on the spur of the moment. The magazine also said it obtained a “Standard Operating Procedure” document for staff to follow whenever Trump arrived. “As soon as Trump was seated, the server had to ‘discreetly present’ a mini bottle of Purell hand sanitizer. (This applied long before Covid, mind you.),” it reported. “Next, cue dialogue: ‘Good (time of day) Mr President. Would you like your Diet Coke with or without ice?’ the server was instructed to recite. “A polished tray with chilled bottles and highball glasses was already prepared for either response. Directions for pouring the soda were detailed in a process no fewer than seven steps long – and illustrated with four photo exhibits. The beverage had to be opened in front of the germophobe commander in chief, ‘never beforehand’.     Donald Trump, then a presidential candidate, walks into the atrium of his new hotel on 16 September 2016, with his future national security adviser Michael Flynn. Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters  “The server was to hold a longneck-bottle opener by the lower third of the handle in one hand and the Diet Coke, also by the lower third, in the other. Once poured, the drink had to be placed at the President’s right-hand side. ‘Repeat until POTUS departs.’” Trump always ate the same meal: shrimp cocktail, well-done steak and fries, sometimes with apple pie or chocolate cake for dessert, according to the Washingtonian. “The manual instructed the server to open mini glass bottles of Heinz ketchup in front of Trump, taking care to ensure he could hear the seal make the ‘pop’ sound.” A tray of crisps, chocolates, granola bars, Tic Tacs, gummy bears, Oreos, chocolate-covered raisins and other snacks had to be on hand. The magazine added that Trump once demanded to know why his dining companion received a bigger steak than he did, while first lady Melania Trump once sent back a Dover sole because it was dressed with parsley and chives. The hotel and its steakhouse witnessed a cavalcade of Maga stars from the lawyer Rudy Giuliani to the White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, from the Florida congressman Matt Gaetz to the MyPillow chief executive, Mike Lindell. The former treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and his wife, the British actor Louise Linton, even lived there for a time. Members of the Trump family also figured prominently, a draw for fans seeking selfies, and guests could indulge at “The Spa by Ivanka Trump”, including a “Himalayan salt chamber” and “fitness center with the latest Technogym equipment” – but temporarily closed due to Covid-19. The bar was a place to sit and watch multiple TV screens showing sport or Fox News. It was, in effect, a Trump embassy in this otherwise liberal city. Quinn observed: “He never went anywhere except the Trump hotel and most of his people didn’t so it was just like an occupying army. You didn’t see them and everybody sort of went on about their lives but there was this awful dark cloud over our heads.”  In 2019, Trump reportedly tried to sell the hotel for about $500m, but those plans are now said to be on hold. The hotel is nine stories tall and has 263 rooms. A casual look at its website shows rooms available from $476 a night, suites from $1,122 a night and signature suites from $1,316 a night.    President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey was one of many foreign leaders who found it politic to put money in Trump’s pocket by staying at his hotel. Photograph: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images   Kevin Chaffee, senior editor of Washington Life magazine, said: “The Trump hotel has been struggling for quite a while and, without him being there, people don’t need to curry favour by staying there. Some embassies had their events there and they don’t need to do that now.” He added: “The bar was like the White House mess but those people no longer have any reason to meet and try to find out what’s happening on the scene because the man is gone. So it must be like a ghost town.” The Trumps left few other traces in Washington. The former president’s daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, have vacated a mansion they rented in the neighbourhood of Kalorama while working as senior advisers at the White House. The couple have since moved to a luxury condominium in Miami, Florida. Their old house is listed by estate agents as still available to rent for $18,000 a month. It has six bedrooms and seven bathrooms, spans 5,016 square feet and is a stone’s throw from Barack and Michelle Obama’s home. Jack Shrestha, owner of the Kalorama Guest House, which is a mile away, said: “The residents in my neighbourhood where I live is over 90% Democrats so they’re happy Trump is gone. But I’m a business owner. I don’t take sides. For me, it doesn’t even matter. “Ivanka’s son went to school where my daughter went to school, a Jewish school up in Cleveland Park. So I used to see her drop off the kid out there. We didn’t say much because they had told us not to talk to her and take pictures or anything like that.” Washington is dotted with memorials, monuments and statues of former presidents. Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris are already making themselves visible. For now, however, Trump’s hotel ensures that his name remains spelled out in gold letters on Pennsylvania Avenue, arguably America’s most famous street. Quinn commented: “I suspect that whoever does buy it will take down all the gilt and all of the trimmings and turn it into something else that’s very un-Trump-like.”  \\n Senator Lisa Murkowski exactly the type of Republican the GOP no longer needs or can afford.

All four properties reportedly are key to the investigation into Trump’s finances led by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance. Wells Fargo and other banks have warned investors who funded Trump’s loans that a revenue decline due in part to the coronavirus pandemic means some of the properties may not have enough money to make their mortgage payments, according to banker notes tracked by CBS MoneyWatch.  Vance is investigating some $280 million in loans over eight years to the Trump properties, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. Those loans were made by subsidiaries of Ladder Capital Corp., a real-estate investment trust based in New York, according to the Journal. The son of the Trump Organization chief financial officer works at Ladder Capital, the newspaper reported.   Vance has been conducting a larger probe into possible fraud involving insurance, tax and bank claims by the Trump Organization. His staff is now poring over Trump’s tax returns. The four Trump properties have underperformed for years, even before the pandemic, according to CBS. Bankers underwriting a loan on Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Midtown predicted in 2012 that the 60-story high rise would earn more than $20 million a year. The building has never hit that annual income, according to CBS.  Kroll Bond Rating Agency in January placed mortgage debt linked to the Trump International Hotel & Tower overlooking Central Park on its list of “loans of concern” due to a “deterioration in financial performance,” CBS reported. Loans linked to Trump’s high rise in Manhattan’s financial district at 40 Wall St. and Trump Plaza, a 36-story commercial and condo tower on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, also were reportedly on bank “watch lists.” The Upper East Side condo tower was removed from the list last month, thought it wasn’t clear why because its financial performance was still weak, according to CBS. Commercial mortgages like the ones tied to Trump’s buildings are bundled together by bankers into investment vehicles called commercial mortgage-backed securities. They are then sold to big investors like pension or mutual funds, which receive an interest payment based on financial performance. The Trump Organization has so far not missed an interest payment on any of the buildings, and is currently not in danger of defaulting or losing any of the properties to either foreclosure or a forced sale, according to CBS.  The Trump Organization failed to respond to repeated requests by CBS. Trump’s 2016 campaign pitch rested on his claimed business acumen that he told supporters would help him run the nation. In fact, Trump’s business record is one of failure; six of his businesses have filed for bankruptcy.  Trump personally holds some $421 million in debt, and loans are largely coming due in the next four years, The New York Times reported last year after obtaining more than two decades of his tax returns. Forbes has reported that Trump owes as much as $1 billion.   \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\nQ: What’s the difference between the Branch Davidians and the Trump Death Cult?\\nA: The Branch Davidians thought their leader was Jesus, whereas the Trumpies think their guy is way the fuck better than Jesus.\\nI mean, what other conclusion can you draw these days?\\nThe Alabama Republican Party has unanimously passed a resolution calling Donald J.

Trump was also presented with a proclamation from the Alabama Republican Party Executive Committee praising the former president as “one of the greatest and most effective presidents in the 245-year history of this republic,” according to Fox News. The former president, who resides at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, was strolling the private club’s grounds when he made a surprise visit to the fundraiser held by Lynda Blanchard, who served as ambassador to Slovenia -- where Melania Trump is from -- under his administration. “Honored to have received a surprise visit from President Trump at my event this weekend!” Blanchard said on her campaign’s Facebook page Monday. “I can’t wait to build on the MAGA Agenda and deliver results for the people of Alabama!” While Trump did not give a coveted endorsement to Blanchard at the fundraiser, he lauded her work as ambassador. “[Y]ou’ve announced [ an Alabama Senate run], and it’s a big story,” Trump told the crowd at the Saturday night fundraiser, according to Yellowhammer News. “I can say you did a great job as ambassador.” Blanchard and her husband “were representatives of this country, and you both did a fantastic job. And I know something about Slovenia — you know that it’s a little paradise over there,” Trump added, referring to his wife’s ties to the country. Perry Hooper, a member of the Alabama GOP’s executive committee, presented the proclamation to Trump, which says he “accomplished more in 48 months than Joe Biden did in 48 years as a senator and vice-president.” “The resolution, basically, it just talks about the greatness of Donald J. Trump, how he made America great again and I hope other states will follow suit,” Hooper told Fox News. Blanchard is the only candidate to announce a Senate run so far in 2022 after Sen. Richard Shelby announced he would retire instead of seeking another term. Also reportedly mulling over a campaign are Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Huntsville and Katie Britt, former Shelby chief of staff and current president and CEO of the Business Council of Alabama.

The White House on Thursday released results of his most recent physical, revealing that his Body Mass Index is now 30.4. That’s based on the fact that he’s now carrying 243 pounds on his 6-foot, 3-inch frame. That’s up from 236 pounds in September 2016 before he became president. An index rating of 30 is the level at which doctors consider someone obese under this commonly used formula. About 40 percent of Americans are obese, and that raises their risk for heart disease, diabetes, stroke and some forms of cancer. Trump doesn’t drink alcohol or smoke, but he’s not a big fan of the gym either. His primary form of exercise is golf. And he says he gets plenty of walking in around the White House complex. As for his diet, Trump’s love of fast food remains. Last month, he invited the college football champion Clemson Tigers to the White House during the partial government shutdown. With the White House kitchen too understaffed to cater a meal, Trump stepped in: He ordered burgers, french fries and pizza. Despite gaining four pounds from last year, Dr. Sean Conley, the president’s physician, said the 72-year-old president “remains in very good health overall.” His resting heart rate is 70 beats a minute and his blood pressure reading was 118 over 80, well within the normal range. Conley said routine lab tests were performed and Trump’s liver, kidney and thyroid functions are all normal as were his electrolytes and blood counts. An electrocardiogram, a test that measures electrical activity generated by the heart as it beats, remained unchanged from last year. “Despite the fact that he’s obese, his blood pressure is normal,” said Dr. Mariell Jessup, the Heart Association’s chief science and medical officer. Using the association’s heart risk calculator, “he has a 17 percent chance of developing cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years,” mostly because of his age and slightly elevated bad cholesterol, she said. Modern-day presidents have undergone regular exams to catch any potential problems but also to assure the public that they are fit for office. Trump went to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center last week for his second periodic physical, which lasted about four hours. During his exam, he received a flu shot and an inoculation to help prevent shingles, a viral infection that causes a painful rash. “I performed and supervised the evaluation with a panel of 11 different board-certified specialists,” Conley wrote in a memorandum to the White House. “He did not undergo any procedures requiring sedation or anesthesia.” His cholesterol reading improved since last year. At his physical in January 2018, his total cholesterol was 223, which his higher than recommended, even though he was taking a low dose of the statin drug Crestor to help lower so-called “bad” cholesterol and fats. Last year, his doctor said he would increase that dose in an effort to get Trump’s bad cholesterol reading of 143 down below 120. Now, Trump’s total cholesterol is down to 196, yet his LDL or “bad” cholesterol is 122 — slightly elevated. Conley said he planned to increase the dosage of a statin drug to 40 milligrams a day to bring the president’s cholesterol reading down further. Dr. Robert Eckel, a former American Heart Association president and cardiologist at the University of Colorado, said he would aim for an LDL below 100. “Losing some weight would help modify some of the risk factors for heart disease,” Eckel said. “A 20- to 25-pound weight loss would be what I’d recommend if he were my patient. And that’s not a quick fix.” ___ Chief Medical Writer Marilynn Marchione in Milwaukee contributed to this report.  \\nFormer President Donald Trump said Meghan Markle was “no good,” an ex-advisor claimed on Steve Bannon’s  War Room  podcast earlier this week.\\nHowever, the former president declined to publicly weigh-in on Oprah Winfrey’s interview with the Duchess of Sussex, citing the treatment of British television pundit Piers Morgan for speaking negatively on Markle.\\n Jason Miller claimed Trump told him, “She’s no good… I said it and now everybody is seeing it,” Miller said.

When she called him\\xa0“misogynistic” and “divisive,” during the run-up to the 2016 election, he punched back. “I didn’t know that she was nasty.”\\nLast September, Trump allowed that he was “not a fan” when Markle and Prince Harry hinted at a Joe Biden presidential endorsement.\\n“And I would say this — and she probably has heard that — but I wish a lot of luck to Harry, because he’s gonna need it,” Trump said then.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Former US Presidents urge Americans to get vaccinated in PSA (March, 2021)\\n \\n 00:48\\n \\n - Source:\\n CNN\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n CNN\\n \\xa0—\\xa0\\n \\n\\n \\n The White House said it would welcome former President Donald Trump’s help in promoting the coronavirus vaccine to his supporters but says there are other ways to convince conservatives to get the shot.\\n \\n \\n The topic of how to sway White Republicans – who polls have shown are more likely to be hesitant to receive the vaccine – has been the subject of discussion among President Joe Biden and his advisers.\\n \\n \\n “I discussed it with my team and they say the thing that has more impact than anything Trump would say to the MAGA folks is what the local doctors, what the local preachers, what the local people in the community say,” Biden said at the White House on Monday.\\n \\n \\n “I urge all local docs and ministers and priests to talk about why, why it’s important to get in to get that vaccine, and even after that, until everyone is in fact vaccinated, to wear this mask,” he said.\\n \\n \\n Earlier, the White House laid out how it was reaching conservatives with vaccine messaging, even as officials acknowledged a Democratic president did not carry the same weight among that population as other public figures.\\n \\n \\n “If former President Trump woke up tomorrow and wanted to be more vocal about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine certainly we’d support that,” press secretary Jen Psaki said at a Monday’s White House briefing.\\n \\n \\n Health officials, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, have said Trump’s voice in promoting the vaccine would go far in convincing Republicans to get it.

Williams, a political analyst and co-host of “The Five,” asserted in an opinion piece Monday that Trump will be remembered for his fits of envy and catastrophic missteps in the COVID-19 pandemic. “The bottom line is that he produced the greatest failure of presidential leadership in history,” Williams wrote in The Hill. The Fox News personality laid out his case for Trump’s mishandling of the pandemic and wrote that while the former president deserved some credit for starting vaccine production, he merited it for nothing else. He highlighted President Joe Biden’s more effective management of the vaccine distribution, citing statistics and approval ratings to condemn the twice-impeached Trump and build a positive case for the new administration’s initial weeks in office.     Juan Williams blasted Donald Trump\\'s mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic.  Steven Ferdman via Getty Images    He focused on one of the most damning numbers: the death toll. “In January, Trump’s last month in the White House, the nation had the highest number of COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic began. Shortly after he left office, the virus death toll topped 500,000,” Williams wrote. “With Biden in the White House, the nation has turned that around in 50 days.” Williams pointed to falling infection rates and ramped-up vaccination under Biden, and he admonished Trump for his “whiny” response to Biden’s prime-time address on the pandemic last week. “If I wasn’t President, you would be getting that beautiful ‘shot’ for 5 years, at best, and probably wouldn’t be getting it at all. I hope everyone remembers!” Trump wrote. “Trump will get his wish to be remembered,” Williams wrote. “He will be remembered for his jealous rage.” Williams, a frequent critic of Trump, previously accused colleagues on “The Five” of ignoring damning evidence from the Capitol riot during Trump’s second impeachment trial. “I guess you are afraid of it because it’s a reminder,” he snapped. In December, Williams announced he had contracted COVID-19.     Editor\\'s note: A previous version of this story said an investigative agency requested the phone call between Trump and Watson. It should have said no investigative agency had requested the call.  In a December phone call with the chief investigator in Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger\\'s office, former President Donald Trump insisted he won Georgia\\'s presidential election, telling the investigator \"the country is counting on\" an audit that was launched to determine whether the signature verification process for mail ballots was done properly in the state\\'s third largest county, according to an audio recording of the call. \"This country is counting on it because it\\'s very interesting. ... I won everything but Georgia, you know, and I won Georgia -- I know that -- by a lot, and the people know it, and you know, something happened there. I mean, something bad happened,\" Trump told the chief investigator, Frances Watson, according to the recording of the six-minute call, which was first obtained by The Wall Street Journal, and later obtained by ABC News. The former president goes on to tell Watson, \"When the right answer comes out, you\\'ll be praised. ... People will say, great, because that\\'s -- that\\'s what it\\'s about, that ability to check it, and to make it right because everyone knows it\\'s wrong.\" The existence of this new audio recording comes amid a criminal probe of Trump\\'s efforts to overturn the results of the November election in Georgia, which he lost by 11,779 votes. At the center of that investigation, which was launched by the Fulton County district attorney\\'s office last month, is an hour-long phone call Trump had with Raffensperger on Jan. 2. In that call, Trump spewed baseless conspiracy theories and falsehoods about the election and pleaded with Raffensperger to \"find\" the exact number of votes he needed to win Georgia. Trump has denied wrongdoing, and his impeachment attorneys disputed he \"acted improperly in that telephone call in any way.\" A spokesperson for Trump has not responded to ABC News\\' request for comment.     Former President Donald Trump leaves the Trump Tower in Manhattan area of New York, March 9, 2021. James Devaney/GC Images via Getty Images     Raffensperger announced on Dec. 14 that investigators in his office, in coordination with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI), would conduct a signature match audit of absentee ballot envelopes, saying there were specific and credible allegations that signature matching wasn\\'t done properly by election officials in the June primary. A total of 15,118 absentee ballot oath envelopes, which is where voters sign, were randomly selected to be audited. The audit was completed on Dec. 29, and investigators only discovered two ballots that should not have been accepted as they were and should have undergone the \"cure\" process. But the GBI director also made clear that neither of those two ballots were fraudulently cast. According to the recording, Watson assured Trump that her team and the GBI are \"only interested in the truth and finding, you know, finding the information that\\'s based on the facts.\" ABC News previously reported on this call\\'s existence in January. At that time, a source familiar with the matter said Trump had told Watson to \"find the fraud\" and that she would be a \"national hero\" for it. Those exact words are not spoken in the audio recording of the call. In a follow-up conversation, that source, whom ABC News can now identify as Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs, said that was how Watson relayed the call to her. \"This is the interpretation the investigator had after the call. It is absurd to suggest that President Trump didn\\'t suggest to the investigator to \\'find the fraud,\\'\" said Fuchs, who noted that Watson called her after the call with Trump took place. When the call was first reported on, ABC News did not identify the investigator because the source sharing the call\\'s details asked Watson remain unnamed due to the threat environment election officials were facing. In this recording, however, Trump identifies her by name. ABC News has reached out to Watson for comment about the call and audio recording, but has not heard back. However, ABC\\'s Atlanta affiliate, WSB, also obtained the recording and spoke exclusively with Watson. \"It is something that is not expected, and as I mentioned in the call, I was shocked that he would take the time to do that,\" Watson told WSB\\'s Mark Winne. She also said she didn\\'t feel she was being pressured and that no investigative agency had requested the phone call. In a statement, Raffensperger\\'s spokesperson, Ari Schaffer, said, \"This phone call is just one more example of how Secretary Raffensperger\\'s office\\'s public comments also reflect what was said in one-on-one conversations: We would follow the law, count every legal vote and investigate any allegations of fraud. That\\'s exactly what we did, and how we arrived at the accurate final vote tally.\"     Brad Raffensperger, Georgia\\'s secretary of state, speaks during a news conference at the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, Dec. 14, 2020. Bloomberg via Getty Images, FILE     In the recording of the call, Trump references Watson meeting with his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and Watson indicates that happened a day prior to the call. ABC News previously confirmed Meadows was in Cobb County attempting to observe the audit taking place on Dec. 22. Raffensperger\\'s deputy, Jordan Fuchs, said at the time that she did not allow Meadows to enter the room where investigators were working, but did allow him to stand in the doorway. Trump does much of the talking throughout this call, rambling at times about his electoral victories in other states, like Florida, Ohio, Alabama and Texas, implying those wins are evidence that his loss in Georgia was impossible. \"Whatever you can do, Frances, it would be -- it\\'s a great thing. It\\'s an important thing for the country, so important. You have no idea, so important. And I very much appreciate it,\" he said, according to the recording. Near the end of the call, Trump asked Watson whether investigators will be working through Christmas, saying, \"Because you know we have that date of the 6th, which is a very important day.\" Jan. 6 was the day Congress counted the electoral votes, the last step in the certification process of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris\\'s victory. That morning, Trump told a crowd of supporters at a rally, \"I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard. ... We fight like hell. And if you don\\'t fight like hell, you\\'re not going to have a country anymore.\" It wasn\\'t long after that when a mob of Trump supporters and violent extremists descended upon the U.S. Capitol, overcoming police to infiltrate the nation\\'s seat of government, forcing lawmakers and then-Vice President Mike Pence to seek safety as insurrectionists attempted to obstruct Congress and Pence from following through with their constitutional duty to affirm Biden\\'s win.    (Alex Brandon | AP file photo)\\nIn this Oct. 5, 2020, photo, President Donald Trump removes his mask as he stands on the Blue Room Balcony upon returning to the White House in Washington, after leaving Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, in Bethesda, Md. Trump announced he tested positive for COVID-19 on Oct. 2.   In retrospect, last year America would have been wise to have ignored Donald Trump’s words about the coronavirus, as these words and the administration’s subsequent incompetent response resulted in hundreds of thousands of unnecessary lost lives. But we shouldn’t ignore Trump’s actions regarding his personal response to COVID-19, as his actions carry lessons that all Americans should bear in mind. Last spring, Trump pooh poohed the danger of the coronavirus, calling it no more dangerous than the common flu, mocked mask-wearing and reassured us that it would magically one day, just disappear. Those words were lies and foolish. Seemingly unaware of the public health consequences, his flood of disinformation, amplified by right-wing media, was designed with the sole intention of reviving the economy so that Trump could reap the political benefit that a robust economy would give him on election day. But the truth about the coronavirus, which Trump hid, tells a different story. On Jan. 28, 2020, Trump was told by his national security team that this virus posed the most formidable national security of his presidency and had the potential to rival the influenza pandemic of 1918, which killed 675,000 Americans and 20 to 50 million human beings. As Trump explained to Bob Woodward in early February, the coronavirus is “more deadly than even your strenuous flus. This is deadly stuff.” When Trump contracted COVID-19 in early October 2020, he didn’t convalesce at home, and fight it out with the measly “flu” bug. No. He checked into Walter Reed Army Medical Center and got a special antibody cocktail unavailable to the general public. Then, despite being infected and presumably mounting an immune response to COVID-19, Trump didn’t take any chances with his own health. No, in January, 2021, he quietly, without fanfare, got vaccinated so as to give himself the best odds of not getting COVID-19 again, and possibly dying from it. These actions reveal a man who both privately acknowledges the health risk of COVID-19 and one who will avail himself of all that the field of medicine can provide to protect himself from it. Unfortunately, many of his followers failed to get this part of the message. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll released last month found that 28 percent of Republicans said they would “definitely not” get vaccinated, and another 18 percent said they would “wait and see” before getting a shot. Having bought into Trump’s sea of disinformation, these unwitting citizens are for a variety of reasons saying they won’t do what the former President knows is best and has done himself. One could disingenuously argue that, just like smoking, although it is bad for the smokers’ health, it’s their life, and if they want to smoke, so be it. But this would be wrong. Unlike smoking, which damages the lungs, and frequently kills the smoker (for now, ignore the dangers of second-hand smoke) not getting vaccinated also puts all our fellow citizens at risk. That’s because in order to stop the coronavirus, we need herd immunity. Herd immunity refers to a population’s resistance to infection either from immunity acquired from national infection and recovery, or from vaccination. The exact threshold to reach herd immunity for the coronavirus is unknown, but recent estimates range from 70 percent to 90 percent. If we fail to reach herd immunity, the coronavirus will continue to spread throughout our population, mutating as it does, and generating variants that may evade our bodies’ natural or vaccinated-induced immunity. This is a public health and economic emergency. The failure to reach herd immunity is the surest way to extend the coronavirus’ reign of public health misery of 500,000-plus deaths, the pandemic-induced social isolation, and prevent a sustained economic rebound. But don’t listen to me. Listen to the former president, who at the Conservative Political Action Conference in late February 2021 said, “Everybody go get your shot.” This message cannot be a whisper. The vaccines are a tour de force of medical science and industry — incredibly effective, produced in record time, with the capacity to bring life in the United States back to normal, and to turbo-charge our economy. All politicians, as stewards of public health and our economy, should be trumpeting these vaccines for the miracle they are. But the vaccine won’t give miraculous results if people don’t get vaccinated. Don’t simply listen to me. Observe the actions of the world’s biggest supposed COVID-19 skeptic, Donald Trump. Furthermore, it’s time that Donald Trump, for the benefit of the nation, treat all Americans with the same concern he shows for himself. Many Americans believe what Donald Trump says. For these Americans, and for those of us who have already been vaccinated or will be, Donald Trump should make a public service announcement that is amplified by all the right wing media encouraging all Americans to get vaccinated by the miracle vaccines that his administration helped make a reality. After all the disinformation and needless death Trump, why not brag a little bit more about these incredible vaccines? Until the time of this much needed public service announcement, Trump’s admirers should carefully consider, when all was said and done, what Trump did. He got vaccinated. And if you’re smart and public-spirited, you should, too.  Justin F. Thulin, M.D., is a dermatologist practicing in Salt Lake City.   Justin F.

Walker (@timallanwalker) March 12, 2021   Trump also teased a run by his daughter-in-law for a U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina. Lara Trump is reportedly mulling a bid to seek the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr in 2022. “I don’t know. You’re running for the Senate. I hear she’s going to run for the Senate,” Trump told attendees, who cheered. Trump told the group he didn’t plan on stopping by. “So, I didn’t exactly prepare for this,” Trump said. “[But I was] walking by, and I hear everyone screaming, and I was like, ‘What’s going on?’ and it was like, ‘We’re going to help dogs,’ and that’s OK with me.” The group is seeking to launch a rescue mission to remove over 500 dogs from China by cargo plane to remove them from meat markets. Chase Scott, the spokesman for Big Dog Ranch Rescue, said “President Trump visited the event and thanked those attending for their support in helping Big Dog Ranch Rescue save 47,000 dogs to date. The crowd responded with a standing ovation for President Trump, Lara Trump, and Laurie Simmons for the work they did to pass the first national anti-cruelty bill to protect animals.” Simmons is the president and founder of the group. Trump had a busy week, releasing several statements from his Save America political action committee (PAC). “No more money for RINOS,” Trump said in a statement released Monday, referring to Republicans In Name Only. “They do nothing but hurt the Republican Party and our great voting base — they will never lead us to Greatness.” Trump’s targeting of “RINOs” also follows his attempt to explain what happened in two runoff races in Georgia. Republicans had to win both Senate races on Jan. 3 to keep control of the chamber but instead lost them both. “To set the record straight, there were two reasons the Senate races were lost in Georgia,” Trump said in a statement on Thursday. “First, Republicans did not turn out to vote because they were so angry and disappointed with Georgia Republican leadership and Governor [Brian] Kemp for failing to stand up to Stacey Abrams,” he said, going on to slam the state’s Consent Decree, which he has blasted in the past. Trump’s comments followed reports that his lawyers had sent out cease-and-desist letters to three fundraising entities for the Republican Party — the Republican National Committee (RNC), the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), and the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), according to Politico.

(REUTERS)    The question of whether former president Trump would lose his clout within the Republican Party has been quickly answered by the number of GOP power brokers visiting Mr Trump at his new permanent home in Mar-A-Lago.  Florida Republican strategist Gianno Caldwell told  The Palm Beach Post  that it was \"unquestionable\" that \"the majority of the party is with him\". Mr Trump showed his lasting influence over the party when a small part of the spring donor retreat was moved to Mar-A-Lago from a hotel in the area, as reported by  The Washington Post.   A dinner speech will be given by Mr Trump at his private club as he\\'s in the middle of a feud with the party over the use of his name and likeness in fundraising efforts.

Mr Caldwell told the paper: \"The party is fractured, so it\\'s going to be very difficult to unite the party in a way which is cohesive for legitimate forward movement.\" A CPAC straw poll found that 97 per cent of conference attendees approved of Mr Trump’s job performance as president, but only 55 per cent had him as their favourite candidate for 2024. Mr Caldwell said that some of Mr Trump\\'s statements \"were despicable and something a president should never say\". He also said that many conservatives at least in private think that Mr Trump is responsible for the Capitol riot that took place on 6 January. He added that many conservatives feel under pressure at the moment because of media coverage and social media bans. He said: \"Conservatives are legitimately getting beat up everywhere. This is a really, really rough place to be because there is also a lack of leadership in the GOP right now.\" Former Obama presidential campaign adviser Spencer Critchley told  The Palm Beach Post  that \"the Republican Party is being eaten alive from within” by Mr Trump, adding: \"He is doing all this stuff that only serves his own impulsive interest of the moment and the Republican Party seems helpless to do anything but go along with it, even though he is attacking one of the things they presumably care most about, their ability to raise money.\" Palm Beach political consultant Blair Brandt called Mr Trump \"the presumptive frontrunner for 2024 at this time,\" and told  The Palm Beach Post that he\\'s the \"de facto ideological leader of the party\". He added that a lot of people visit Mr Trump now while he has \"downtime\" before his \"availability\" shrinks. A visit to southern Florida is an effective winter vacation for many Republicans according to Mr Brandt, as other donors with a lot of money also live in Palm Beach. Mr Brandt said: \"If Trump was living in Macon, Georgia, you would be going there to see him, but here, people are not just meeting with him but also donors who typically participate at the six-figure level and above.\" Speaking about Mr Trump’s influence within the GOP, Mr Brandt said: \"The working-class voters are really the base right now and they are still waving Trump flags.\"  The Independent has reached out to President Trump\\'s Save America PAC for comment.

The incident was documented in a piece recently published by The New Yorker.  According to the magazine, the sordid shiva story was revealed during the course of the Manhattan District Attorney\\'s efforts to flip Mr Trump\\'s accountant, Allen Weisselberg, for use in their investigation of the Trump Organization.  Mr Weisselberg\\'s former daughter-in-law was debriefed by the Manhattan district attorney\\'s office, and spoke with The New Yorker about Mr Weisselberg.  She described the accountant as being \"obsessed\" with earning Mr Trump\\'s favour.  \"His whole worth is, \\'Does Donald like me today?\\'\" Mr Weisselberg said. \"It\\'s his whole life, his core being. He\\'s obsessed. He has more feelings and adoration for Donald than for his wife.\" According to Ms Weisselberg, Mr Trump and the accountant have worked together since the 1970s. She said if anyone had compromising information on Mr Trump, it would be her former father-in-law.  \"You walk down the hall, it\\'s Allen-Donald, Allen-Donald – they don\\'t do anything separately,\" she said. \"Allen would know everything.\" Ms Weisselberg said she met Mr Trump for the first time at Mr Weisselberg\\'s house in Long Island while the family sat shiva for the accountant\\'s mother.  Sitting shiva is a seven-day act of mourning that Jewish people observe following the death of a loved one. It is generally regarded as a sombre, spiritual custom.  According to Ms Weisselberg, Mr Trump immediately began insulting the family upon arrival.  \"This is where my CFO lives?\" Mr Trump asked, referencing Mr Weisselberg\\'s house, which presumably does not contain a golden toilet. \"It\\'s embarrassing!\"  Mr Trump reportedly took a limo to the religious observation.  After entering, Mr Trump reportedly showed off photos of himself on a yacht surrounded by nude women to attendees of the funerary rite.  Then, Ms Weisselberg said Mr Trump made a pass at her.  \"After that, he starts hitting on me,\" she told the magazine.  According to Ms Weisselberg\\'s account, Mr Weisselberg gave Mr Trump no pushback, even though she was dating his son.  That incident, among others, is why Ms Weisselman ultimately thinks her former father-in-law will, not be swayed to turn on the former president.  \"I don\\'t know,\" she said. \"For Donald, it\\'s a business. But for Allen it\\'s a love affair.\"  The Independent requested a comment from Mr Trump but did not immediately receive a response.     President Donald Trump encouraged Georgia’s chief elections investigator in a December phone call to uncover “dishonesty” in her investigation of absentee ballot signatures in an effort to reverse his defeat against Joe Biden in the state, according to a recording of the call released this week by the Georgia secretary of state’s office.  “The people of Georgia are so angry at what happened to me,” Trump told Frances Watson, the chief investigator for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, according to the recording. “They know I won, won by hundreds of thousands of votes. It wasn’t close.” He added, “When the right answer comes out, you’ll be praised.” Later on the call, he said, “You have the most important job in the country right now.” The Washington Post reported on the substance of Trump’s Dec.\\u200923 call in January, describing him saying that Watson should “find the fraud” and that she would be a “national hero,” based on an account from Jordan Fuchs, the deputy secretary of state, whom Watson briefed on his comments. In fact, he did not use those precise words. Rather, Trump urged the investigator to scrutinize Fulton County, where she would find “dishonesty,” he said. He also said, “whatever you can do, Frances, it would be — it’s a great thing. It’s an important thing for the country. So important. You’ve no idea. So important. And I very much appreciate it.” When The Post first reported on the call, state officials said they did not believe that a recording existed. Officials located the recording on a trash folder on Watson’s device while responding to a public records request, according to a person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the internal process. Watson has not responded to requests for comment. The Post originally withheld her name because of the risk of threats and harassment directed at election officials.     In an interview with WSB-TV, she said she was “shocked” by Trump’s call but did not feel pressured by his outreach. A spokesman for Trump did not respond to a request for comment. The recording was first reported Wednesday by the Wall Street Journal. At the time Trump called her, Watson was leading an audit of mail ballot signatures in Cobb County, a suburb of Atlanta. Legal experts have said the president’s outreach — and another call he placed directly to Raffensperger on Jan.\\u20092 — may have amounted to obstruction of a criminal investigation. The Fulton County district attorney’s office has launched a probe into the efforts by Trump and his allies to subvert the results in Georgia. On the call, Watson sounds surprised and flattered to find herself on the telephone with the U.S. president — but also careful to reveal little about the investigation she was conducting in partnership with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. “Well, Mr. President, I appreciate your comments,” she said. “And I can assure you that our team and the GBI, that we’re only interested in the truth and finding, you know, finding the information that’s based on the facts.” She added: “I know that you’re a very, very busy, very important man. And I’m very honored that you called. Quite, quite frankly, I’m shocked that you, that you would take time to do that. But I am very appreciative.” Trump said he called on the suggestion of his chief of staff at the time, Mark Meadows — who had returned from a visit to Georgia the previous day to see the signature investigation in action. Raffensperger had called for the audit after Trump and his allies claimed without evidence that thousands of absentee ballots with forged signatures on their envelopes had been improperly accepted by local election officials. In November, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) called Raffensperger directly to inquire about the feasibility of rechecking ballot signatures and discarding all absentee ballots in counties with high mismatching rates, Raffensperger told The Post last year. Graham denied that he was trying to toss votes, saying he was merely seeking information to better understand how the state verified mail ballots. It would be impossible to discard the ballots associated with individual ballot envelopes, as they are separated early in the tabulation process to protect voter privacy. On the call with Watson, Trump urged her to check the envelope signatures against older signatures on file rather than a current file — an apparent attempt to inflate the numbers of nonmatching signatures. In Georgia and Florida in 2018, thousands of eligible voters saw their ballots rejected because officials checked their signatures against one on file that was older, and the voters’ signatures had evolved in the intervening time. “I hope you’re going back two years as opposed to just checking, you know, one against the other because that would just be sort of a signature check that didn’t mean anything,” Trump said. “But if you go back two years, and if you can get to Fulton, you’re going to find things that are going to be unbelievable, the dishonesty that we’ve heard from, just good sources, really good sources.” “But Fulton is the mother lode, you know, as the expression goes. Fulton County,” he added. Trump also urged Watson to continue investigating past the Christmas holiday “because, you know, we have the date, which is a very important date” — an apparent reference to Jan.\\u20096, the day a joint session of Congress was scheduled to formalize the electoral college results. Trump was fixated on that date as a last opportunity to overturn the election results, encouraging thousands of his supporters to descend on Washington and protest the vote. The ensuing riot at the U.S. Capitol left five people dead, including one police officer. Dozens of officers were injured. In the aftermath of the violence, Congress formally recognized President Biden’s win that night.        Image source, Reuters Image caption, Dr Anthony Fauci (left) said the Trump administration was \"very successful in getting us the vaccines\"      The top US infectious disease expert says it would be \"a game-changer\" if ex-President Donald Trump encouraged Republicans to get the Covid vaccine.    \"It will make all the difference in the world,\" Dr Anthony Fauci told Fox News Sunday. \"He\\'s a very widely popular person among Republicans.\"    A recent US opinion poll showed as many as 49% of Republican male supporters did not want to get vaccinated.   Mr Trump last month said \"everybody, go get your shot\" at a conservative forum.   It was the first time he publicly encouraged Americans to do so. He has not commented on the issue since then.    Mr Trump, who was privately vaccinated in January, was absent when four other ex-presidents - Barack Obama, George W Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter - appeared last week in a public service announcement for the vaccination.   The US has seen more than 530,000 Covid-related deaths and nearly 29.5 million infections, according to Johns Hopkins University.    What did Dr Fauci say?    Dr Fauci, the chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, told Fox News Sunday: \"If he [Trump] came out and said \\'Go and get vaccinated, it\\'s really important for your health, the health of your family, and the health of the country\\', it seems absolutely inevitable that the vast majority of people who are his followers would listen to him.   \"He\\'s such a strongly popular person. I cannot imagine that if he comes out that they would not get vaccinated.\"   Dr Fauci said the Trump administration was \"very successful in getting us the vaccines we have right now\".   \"It seems like an intrinsic contradiction, the fact that you have a programme that was started during his presidency, and he\\'s not out telling people to get vaccinated.   \"I wish he would. He has such incredible influence over people in the Republican party - it would really be a game-changer if he did,\" Dr Fauci said.    Media caption, \\'Each one of these people mattered\\'     The number of vaccine doses administered each day has been steadily rising in the US, and on Saturday alone about three million people got the jab - an achievement hailed by Dr Fauci.   About one in five Americans have received at least one dose, with about one in nine fully vaccinated, the Associated Press news agency is quoting as saying America\\'s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   Mr Biden previously set a target of 100 million vaccinations by his 100th day in office. But in his speech, he said this target would now be reached on day 60, which is 20 March.    Correction 7 April 2021: This article has been amended to remove a reference to the US as by far the world\\'s worst hit country by the pandemic, which does not take account of figures on deaths and infections in relation to the population.      More on this story             Former President Donald Trump\\'s personal policy toward governors during the COVID-19 pandemic was no secret. He wanted to work with them, he said, as long as they showed him some appreciation. \"It\\'s a two-way street, they have to treat us well also,\" he said during a Fox News interview in March 2020. Now, an anecdote from ABC News\\' Jonathan Karl\\'s upcoming book Front Row at The Trump Show, sheds even more light on how Trump made crucial, potentially life-or-death decisions based on whether he felt he was getting enough compliments. Karl reports that upon learning a Navy hospital ship was heading to Seattle last March, Trump decided to redirect it to Los Angeles, solely because he liked the things California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) had been saying about him. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), on the other hand, did not have a big fan in Trump. \"Don\\'t you think we should send it to California?\" Trump reportedly asked. \"Gavin has been saying the nicest things about me.\" Trump reportedly said he considered Inslee a \"showboater\" and a \"real jerk,\" which apparently meant, in the former president\\'s mind, that Washingtonians were less deserving of extra hospital beds.

Trump delivered a scathing review of Joe Biden’s first prime-time White House speech as President, accusing his successor of “assaulting the American people with long words.” In a statement issued from his home at Mar-a-Lago, Trump ripped Biden for spewing a stream of words that were often three or four syllables. Reeling off a list of the offensively long words in Biden’s speech, Trump singled out “hyperbole,” “administer,” and “effective.” “This should never be allowed to happen in this country,” he said. “No one knows what these words mean, and no one will ever know,” Trump said.   A dog rescue charity with links to Lara Trump has spent as much as $1.9 million at former President Donald Trump’s properties over the last seven years and will drop an additional quarter-million at his Mar-a-Lago country club this weekend. According to a permit filed with the town of Palm Beach, Florida, Big Dog Ranch Rescue estimates it will spend $225,000 at the club where Donald Trump has taken up full-time residence since leaving the White House. All the profit from that spending winds up in his pocket. Internal Revenue Service filings show that the group has spent as much as $1,883,160 on fundraising costs at Mar-a-Lago and Trump’s golf course 18 miles north in Jupiter starting in 2014. Lara Trump, the wife of Eric Trump, started being listed as a chairwoman for charity events in 2018, and the group’s president, Lauren Simmons, visited the White House in 2019 for the signing of a bill addressing animal cruelty. Late Friday night, Simmons issued a statement defending her association with Lara Trump, whom she described as a great advocate of dogs, and her use of Donald Trump’s properties. “The quality of service, beauty of the venue and excellent rate provided us as a nonprofit as well as the generosity of supporters who sell-out our event there every year allows us to rescue and home thousands of dogs. Our investment there and at the other venues mentioned in the article has netted more than $12 million over an eight-year period which allows us to continue our mission,” Simmons said. However, she did not respond to the question of why she was putting money into the pocket of someone who tried to overturn the results of an election he lost and whose incitement led to the deaths of three police officers and injuries to 140 more. Spokesman Chase Scott responded later that Simmons’ views about the election or her politics generally were beside the point. “The sole objective of our fundraisers is to raise as much money as possible to save as many lives as possible. Politics play zero role within our organization and to infer they do does a disservice to the many who work and volunteer with a passion to heal and home our beloved dogs,” Scott said. Many businesses have cut their ties to Trump following the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, for which Trump was impeached after he spent two months lying about the election having been “stolen” from him. Trump asked his followers to gather in Washington, D.C., on the day Congress was meeting to certify the Electoral College votes, and then urged them to march on the Capitol to intimidate his own vice president into violating the Constitution and installing Trump for another term. Simmons, however, was among those propagating Trump’s lies on social media, posting messages to “stop the steal,” a phrase the defeated president’s supporters had adopted. On Jan. 3, three days before the mob attack, Simmons shared a post stating: “Either we TAKE power back or we will never be free again. No more asking nicely.” The charity briefly pulled back from using Mar-a-Lago immediately after Trump’s 2017 remarks praising the racist, anti-Semitic protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, but ultimately held its March 2018 fundraiser there anyway, even while many other charities abandoned Mar-a-Lago for good.        Former President Donald Trump\\'s Mar-a-Lago resort has raked in money for the Trump family by directing events to the site. (Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images)    Daughter-in-law Lara Trump has been advertised as a “chairwoman” of the charity’s fundraisers over the past several years. The spending by a charity she is associated with at her family’s businesses mirrors practices at Donald Trump’s now-shuttered Trump Foundation and Eric Trump’s Eric Trump Foundation, which also spent donor money at Trump properties. The self-dealing by the Trump Foundation was so egregious that New York state Attorney General Letitia James cited it as the reason the charity could no longer operate. Donald Trump over the course of his presidency funneled $8.5 million of Republican donor money into his own cash registers by directing spending by the entities he controlled, including the Republican National Committee, toward his own businesses. He similarly directed several million taxpayer dollars into his own properties by insisting on spending his frequent golf vacations there, thereby forcing Secret Service and other support staff to spend money at them, as well.

(Gage Skidmore/Flickr)\\n   The Republican Party base still loves former President Donald Trump, even though he was soundly defeated in his re-election bid and his unpopularity cost his party control of both chambers of Congress.  Atlantic columnist Adam Serwer writes that there\\'s a simple reason the GOP base still loves Trump despite being ousted from office after just one term: They saw him as a punishment for all the people in America whom they hate. \"Trump was not a successful president,\" Serwer contends. \"But as a form of punishment, he was everything conservatives dreamed of, and they loved him for it.\" Serwer goes on to documents some of the ways conservatives relished seeing Trump punish their foes. \"Early in his administration, Trump banned travelers from several Muslim-majority countries, barred federal grants to so-called sanctuary cities, and sought to deport hundreds of thousands of immigrants who were in the U.S. on temporary protected status,\" he writes. \"Almost all of his accomplishments were punitive.\" The challenge for Biden and Democrats, writes Serwer, is to provide broadly shared prosperity so that at least some Republican voters will see that Democrats aren\\'t simply out to exact revenge on them for electing Trump. \"Biden\\'s rescue bill uses the state as an instrument of broad prosperity rather than as one of vengeance,\" he argues. \"In the process, it stands to address the economic distresses that Trump exploited and the grievances he inflamed. And by making the bill\\'s benefits so broad, Democrats may also make them enduring, insulating them from future efforts to repeal them.\"    Donald Trump hasn\\'t spoken publicly about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\\'s bombshell interview with Oprah because he doesn\\'t want to be \\'canceled\\' like Piers Morgan, his former aide claims.\\xa0 Trump\\'s former senior adviser Jason Miller lifted the lid on his feelings about the Sussexes\\' interview during an appearance on Steve Bannon\\'s podcast on Wednesday.\\xa0\\xa0 Miller said Trump told him he could \\'make a little news\\' by sharing his reaction to the interview - but he ultimately decided it wasn\\'t a good idea.\\xa0\\xa0 \\'When I was talking to the president this morning ... he\\'s like: \"Yeah, [Meghan\\'s] no good.

The discovery of the call comes after state officials originally told CNN that they did not think audio of the call existed. The call added to the examples of Trump\\'s extraordinary efforts to push false claims of widespread voter fraud and influence Georgia election officials as they certified the state\\'s election results. The audio file of the December 23 call between the former President and investigator Frances Watson was discovered as the Georgia Secretary of State\\'s Office responded to a public records request. The personal familiar spoke with CNN on the condition of anonymity to describe the internal process. The Washington Post first reported the details of how the audio of the December phone call emerged. Watson declined comment to CNN through the Georgia Secretary of State\\'s press secretary. CNN previously reported that in the December phone call to the Georgia Secretary of State\\'s Office, Trump urged their top investigator, Watson, to find fraud in the 2020 presidential election, telling her that she would be a \"praised\" for overturning results in favor of President Joe Biden. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis had sent a round of letters to Georgia state officials in February, including the Georgia Secretary of State\\'s Office, asking them to preserve documents relevant to election interference. Willis is currently conducting a criminal investigation into Trump\\'s attempts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia. The secretary of state\\'s office is also separately investigating Trump for his attempts to overturn the state\\'s election results. Audio of an hour-long January 2 phone call in which Trump repeatedly pressured Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \"find\" the exact number of votes needed to overturn Biden\\'s victory surfaced soon after the call happened. But the December call only became public last week. Watson told CNN affiliate WSB-TV\\'s investigative reporter Mark Winne that she had recorded the December call from Trump for posterity. \"It\\'s not every day, that probably will never happen again in my lifetime,\" Watson told WSB. It is still not clear why Watson moved the audio of the call to her trash folder, but Watson told Winne that even though she was surprised Trump called her, she did not perceive any pressure from his phone call. \"It is something that is not expected, as I mentioned in the call you know I was shocked that he would take the time to do that,\" Watson said. Trump in the December call had encouraged Watson to look to uncover \"dishonesty\" in her signature checks for absentee ballots in Fulton County, the most populous county in state and the one that houses most of Atlanta. \"But if you go back two years, and if you can get to Fulton, you are going to find things that are going to be unbelievable,\" the former President said. \"The dishonesty that we\\'ve heard from.

Trump told reporters that he wasn’t considering firing Powell, but reiterated his frustration with the chairman. The comments were particularly striking because they came as the coronavirus pandemic shook the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst week since October 2008. In just a few weeks, U.S. stocks have lost all the gains made during 2019. “I have the right to do that or the right to remove him as chairman,” Trump said Saturday at a news conference called to provide an update on the administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. “He has, so far, made a lot of bad decisions, in my opinion.” No Fed chairman has ever been removed by a president. The law creating the Fed says its officials and those of other independent agencies can be “removed for cause” by a president. While that issue has never arisen in regard to a Fed official, the courts ruled decades ago that “for cause” meant more than a policy disagreement. Powell announced earlier this month a half-point interest rate cut that shrank the Fed’s key rate to a range of just 1% to 1.25%. It marked the first time the central bank has cut rates between scheduled policy meetings since the 2008 financial crisis. And it’s the steepest rate cut the Fed has made since then. Yet, the president continued to complain that he was “not happy with the Fed” because it was “following” and “we should be leading.” The president pointed to lower interest rates set by the central banks in Japan and Germany as proof that Powell had not been aggressive enough in bolstering the U.S. economy. Economists, however, say the lower rates reflect the weaker economic outlooks than the U.S. economy. Trump said he’s made no decision, but suggested he could simply remove him as chairman. Powell’s four-year term ends in February 2022, and his term as a member of the Board of Governors expires January 2028. “I have the right to also take him and put him in a regular position and put somebody else in charge. And I haven’t made any decisions on that,” the president said.  \\nIn reality, the GOP’s worst-case scenario would be running campaign operations at odds with Trump in must-win states across the country next year. With that in mind, Republican senators are making a fresh effort to ensure they and Trump are aligned as much as possible — especially given lingering tensions between the ex-president, their leadership and the seven GOP colleagues who recently voted to convict him at his impeachment trial.\\n“He brought a bunch of new voters into the party that we want to keep,” said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who is running for reelection and has spoken recently to Trump. “He’s the most influential Republican in America. He’s not going to ride off into the sunset, write his memoirs and open a library.”\\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is trying to arbitrate Trump’s beef with GOP senators he views as insufficiently loyal. While he conceded there’s no way to stop Trump from going after Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who voted to convict him in the impeachment trial, Graham told Trump this week that he needs to back as many of the Republican incumbents as possible. \\n“Endorse as many incumbents that you can. Come out for the folks that you can come out for,” Graham recalled telling Trump when they spoke on Monday. “Play team ball to the extent it’s possible.”\\nTrump’s even working on incumbent retention. He spoke recently to Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who is undecided on running again next year. Johnson said it would “probably be an accurate statement” that Trump would like to see him run for a third term.\\nBefore GOP Sen. John Boozman of Arkansas announced his campaign for a third term this week, Trump had already assured the soft-spoken Republican that he’d back his reelection campaign. And Trump has had multiple “very positive” conversations with Sen. John Hoeven about his reelection, the North Dakota Republican said.\\n“He’s showing more enthusiasm and involvement than most former presidents have,” said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has discussed the midterms with Trump. “It’s going to be different. It’ll be sort of a shadow [presidential] campaign going on. I don’t know if he’ll run again, but I think he’s definitely going to be involved in 2022.”\\nTrump has already officially endorsed Boozman, Tim Scott of South Carolina, Jerry Moran of Kansas and John Kennedy of Louisiana; in addition, Hoeven said Trump is supportive of his campaign. Trump is also encouraging former NFL running back Herschel Walker to run against Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.). \\nSenate Republicans are also hopeful that Trump will spare Senate Minority Whip John Thune his vitriol after he threatened to go after the South Dakotan for disparaging Trump’s plans to challenge the election results.\\nMeanwhile, National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Rick Scott (R-Fla.) is expected to meet with Trump this weekend. Scott was a stalwart ally of Trump’s over the last two years but has a tough job triangulating between Trump and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. During an NRSC lunch on Wednesday, attendees said McConnell highlighted that his own super PAC has out-raised Trump’s, a detail first reported by the New York Times. \\nBut Republicans also reported that donors they call are no longer really talking about Trump.\\nThe former president remains livid at McConnell for criticizing his “dereliction of duty” on Jan. 6 as his supporters stormed the Capitol and Trump was slow to call them off or call in military reinforcements. Trump has dinged McConnell’s handling of a December debate over stimulus checks and even tried to take credit for McConnell’s re-election. The two are not on speaking terms. \\nAnd they appear headed for a collision course in some of the party’s five open Senate races following the retirements of GOP Sens. Roy Blunt of Missouri, Rob Portman of Ohio, Richard Shelby of Alabama, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Richard Burr of North Carolina. Republicans are most worried about Pennsylvania and North Carolina, two of Democrats’ best pick-up opportunities and states where Trump-inspired candidates could in theory be more vulnerable in general elections. \\nThose vacant seats will reshape the Senate GOP, as allies of McConnell are either replaced by Democrats or — especially in red states — Trump acolytes. In Missouri, Alabama and Ohio, candidates have a good chance to win primaries by cloaking themselves in the Trump mantle and running at odds with Republican leaders, then easily go on to prevail in general elections.\\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) discussed the open seat in Missouri this week with Trump and said his phone has been ringing off the hook with interest from candidates.\\n“This is a state that voted for President Trump by almost 20 points in 2016 and 17 this last time around. So I expect you’ll see that reflected in the primary field,” Hawley said.\\nToomey, who voted to convict Trump and does not talk to the former president, said he may endorse a candidate in what’s certain to be a crowded primary in his state. But he said there are limits to how much he can guide the direction of the Pennsylvania GOP, where a centrist like former Rep. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.) could face off against Republicans that challenged the election results in the House. \\n“I don’t have the ability to keep someone from winning the primary. That’s something that Pennsylvania Republican voters are going to decide,” Toomey said. He said candidates have a “wide range” of potential approaches to Trump.\\nWhether Trump gets more opportunities to make his mark on the Senate GOP depends on whether Johnson or Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) or someone else in the party retires. Murkowski said the only reason she hasn’t officially said she’s running is “if I tell you one way or the other, then I have no announcement.”\\nThe prospect of seven or more retirements in a 50-member conference is daunting to Senate Republicans who aren’t used to such extreme turnover. More open seats means more potential conflict with Trump in GOP primaries — battles that Republicans are intent on avoiding. \\nSo as Trump shows up on their caller IDs, they’re trying to make sure that Blunt’s retirement announcement this week is the last one they’ll hear. \\n“RonJohn and Grassley are feeling extreme pressure to stay put,” said one Senate Republican.\\n  Former President Donald Trump made a surprise\\xa0appearance during a fundraising event held at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.\\nBig Dog Ranch Rescue President and founder Lauree Simmons\\xa0informed\\xa0WPTV NewsChannel 5\\xa0that the objective for the event, aiming to raise funds for dog\\xa0rescue,\\xa0was to raise half a million dollars.\\xa0\\nSimmons, impacted by photos of the Chinese dog meat market trade,\\xa0wants to launch a rescue mission to extract more than 500 dogs from China by airplane, according to the outlet.\\nDuring his remarks Trump expressed his support, saying\\xa0\"what you\\'re doing is so important.

Yet behind the bluster is a simple fact of which most voters are unaware: Trump barely has any of his own money in the stock market. “It’s like Trump Vodka — he wants everyone to drink it, but he doesn’t drink it himself,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Cresset Wealth Advisors. To have so much wealth and so little invested, he added, is “completely out of balance” and “extremely unusual.” Deep in The New York Times’ recent report on Trump’s tax returns is the fact that he sold more than $200 million in stocks and bonds in the three years leading up to his inauguration. And an Associated Press analysis of his financial disclosures since then shows as much as $8 million more was sold in his first three years in office, even with his investments now in a trust, beyond his direct control. Significantly, those disclosures — which give figures in ranges, not exact amounts — show no substantial buying to make up for it. That left him a stock portfolio last year that ranged between $693,000 — less than what many Americans have in their 401(k)s — and $2.2 million. Even that top figure is less than one-tenth of 1% of his fortune, estimated by Forbes at $2.5 billion. “Why would you talk up the stock market and not own stocks at the same time?” said David Rosenberg, former chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch. What’s behind Trump’s sell-off and lack of buying is not entirely clear, though in a debate during the 2016 campaign, he took a bleak view of the stock market, saying, “We’re in a bubble right now.” Also, after a large sale of individual stocks before the last election, Trump told NBC that he wanted to avoid conflicts of interest while “making deals for this country that maybe will affect one company positively and one company negatively.” (He has continued to hold on to his diversified stock funds, which contain shares from a variety of companies.) Others, though, have cast doubt on the conflict-of-interest explanation and speculated instead that he sold off stock to raise money quickly and quietly to cover his debts. Trump poured $47 million into his last campaign for president and still owes a sizable amount. The White House referred queries about Trump’s stock holdings to the Trump Organization, which declined to comment, leaving financial and political watchers only to speculate. Whatever the reason for selling, Trump’s lack of a substantial stake has not stopped him from vigorously touting the run-up in the stock market. Polls consistently show Trump’s handling of the economy is his strongest issue with voters, and the stock market has withstood the coronavirus crisis better than the economy as a whole. The Standard and Poor’s 500 index has jumped 59 percent since the last presidential election, recovering all the ground lost during a March plunge.  American families now have an average of 15 percent of their assets riding on the market, according to Federal Reserve data, and the richest 1 percent even more: 40 percent. Several voters interviewed this week said that they were surprised Trump wasn’t more heavily invested but that it wouldn’t change their vote. “He isn’t interested in the people; he’s interested in the stock market,” 79-year-old Ruth Johnson said as she shopped at a Walmart in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Johnson, who voted for Trump four years ago but didn’t again this year, thought about it some more and added: “I think he’s more interested in Donald Trump than anything else.” Kenton E. Moore said that he doesn’t support the president but that it makes sense for Trump to avoid stocks, given all the money he has made in real estate. “The stock market is not a safe thing,” Moore, 70, said as he fished in the Missouri River in Council Bluffs. “Why play in the stock market if you don’t have to?”  Trump supporter Cindi Holland, who worked in the transportation industry in Michigan, said she doesn’t know much about what Trump does with his money but there’s one thing she does know: “I have a 401(k) and it’s doing awesome.” Some financial analysts warn that ordinary investors could be particularly vulnerable at a time when stocks are overvalued in relation to long-term earnings. They note individual investors and day traders are flooding into the market the way they did before previous market highs, driving the fastest-rising stocks ever higher. “Momentum investing has run amok here,” said James Abate, managing director of Centre Asset Management. “We’re in a very dangerous time.”  Some have speculated Trump has sold stocks in recent years because he needs cash to pay his debts or to prop up golf properties that have reportedly lost hundreds in millions of dollars. While selling one of his properties could raise alarm bells, unloading some stock might not. Trump’s 2016 sell-off leading up to the election involved shares of more than 100 companies, including manufacturers such as Boeing and General Electric, tech giants Amazon and Ebay, and food makers Kellogg and J.M. Smucker. He also dumped oil drillers and refiners and a pair companies that were involved in the disputed Dakota Access oil pipeline that Trump backed once he took office. What he has left now are just stocks in funds. Those include funds that are betting stocks go down as well as up, ones targeting Japan and Canada, and several that are pegged to the S&P 500. The full extent of Trump’s holdings and sales is impossible to determine from his annual disclosure reports. The holdings are given in ranges, not precise figures, and some disclosures list just capital gains realized from sales, not the much larger cash total. Also, when Trump took office he put his business in a trust managed by his two adult sons, Eric and Don Jr., and his stock funds now reside in three other trusts overseen by JP Morgan. There are no federal ethics laws barring a president from buying and selling as much stock as he wants. Trump has been openly disdainful of some of the rules and norms that have held sway in Washington. His Washington hotel, for example, has become a magnet for foreign diplomats and lobbyists, triggering allegations that Trump is violating the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution. “It would be out of character for President Trump to take action to avoid a conflict of interest,” said Kathleen Clark, a government ethics lawyer at Washington University in St. Louis. “It would be great if he acted that way, but it would out of character.” —— AP writers Josh Funk in Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Sharon Cohen in Chicago contributed to this report.   Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, said on Sunday that he hopes former president Donald Trump will urge his supporters to get the Covid-19 vaccine and emphasized that pandemic-related restrictions should not be lifted prematurely. In a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll released last week, about half of US men who identified themselves as Republicans said they had no plans to get the vaccine. Asked whether Trump should speak to his supporters directly, given those poll numbers, Fauci said on NBC’s Meet the Press program: “I hope he does because the numbers that you gave are so disturbing. “How such a large proportion of a certain group of people would not want to get vaccinated merely because of political considerations … it makes absolutely no sense,” Fauci said. The other living former US presidents – Barack Obama, George W Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter – are set to appear in two public service announcements for the coronavirus vaccine alongside their wives, without Trump. Getting the vaccine was a “no-brainer”, said Fauci, who listed some of the diseases that vaccines had wiped out such as smallpox. “What is the problem here? This is a vaccine that is going to be lifesaving for millions of people,” Fauci said. Fauci is the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and an adviser to President Joe Biden. Trump early in the pandemic appeared at coronavirus briefings with Fauci but later turned on him. Trump in October, weeks after being hospitalized for three days for Covid-19 treatment, criticized Fauci, saying, “Fauci is a disaster … People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots.“ As president, Trump minimized the need for coronavirus restrictions including wearing masks and predicted the pathogen would disappear “like a miracle”. Fauci on Sunday underscored his call for officials around the US not to lift restrictions prematurely and risk a spike in Covid-19 cases. Some states such as Texas have lifted mask-wearing and other restrictions. An uptick in cases can be avoided if Americans continue to get vaccinated “without all of a sudden pulling back on public health measures”, Fauci told CNN’s State of the Union program. “We will gradually be able to pull them [restrictions] back. And if things go as we planned, just as the president said, by the time we get into the early summer, the Fourth of July weekend, we really will have a considerable degree of normality. But we don’t want to let that escape from our grasp by being too precipitous in pulling back,” Fauci added.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Trump on Covid-19 vaccine: \\'I would recommend it\\'\\n \\n 01:37\\n \\n - Source:\\n CNN\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n Politics of the Day\\n 16 videos\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Trump on Covid-19 vaccine: \\'I would recommend it\\'\\n \\n \\n \\n 01:37\\n  \\n Now playing\\n \\n  - Source:\\n CNN\\n \\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\'Is it acceptable?\\': Tapper asks Buttigieg about suspected Chinese spy balloon\\n \\n \\n \\n 02:31\\n  \\n Now playing\\n \\n  - Source:\\n CNN\\n \\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Tapper asks Sen.

But it is a great vaccine. It is a safe vaccine and it is something that works.”\\n \\n \\n The comments – which amount to Trump’s most energetic endorsement of vaccination – come as vaccine hesitancy among Republicans continues to threaten the US’ path to herd immunity. While 92% of Democrats either have gotten vaccinated or want to get vaccinated, that number plummets to 50% among Republicans, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS shows.\\n \\n \\n Though Trump had urged his followers to “go get your shot” during his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, his decision to quietly receive the vaccine without public fanfare earlier this year drew sharp scrutiny and contrasted with his successor and predecessors.\\n \\n \\n President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were each vaccinated on live television in December, and former Presidents Barack Obama, George W.

But the December call only became public last week. \\n \\n \\n Watson told CNN affiliate WSB-TV’s investigative reporter Mark Winne that she had recorded the December call from Trump for posterity. \\n \\n \\n “It’s not every day, that probably will never happen again in my lifetime,” Watson told WSB. \\n \\n \\n It is still not clear why Watson moved the audio of the call to her trash folder, but Watson told Winne that even though she was surprised Trump called her, she did not perceive any pressure from his phone call. \\n \\n \\n “It is something that is not expected, as I mentioned in the call you know I was shocked that he would take the time to do that,” Watson said.\\n \\n \\n Trump in the December call had encouraged Watson to look to uncover “dishonesty” in her signature checks for absentee ballots in Fulton County, the most populous county in state and the one that houses most of Atlanta.\\n \\n \\n “But if you go back two years, and if you can get to Fulton, you are going to find things that are going to be unbelievable,” the former President said. “The dishonesty that we’ve heard from. But Fulton is the mother lode.” \\n \\n \\n Later on the phone call, Trump told Watson that he hoped “we” could win Georgia and that “you have the most important job in the country right now.” \\n \\n    Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, said in interviews Sunday that former president Donald Trump should be enlisted to encourage his supporters to get a coronavirus vaccine, after recent polling showed Republican men and Trump supporters have the highest rates of vaccine hesitancy. An NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist poll released last week showed that nearly half of Republican men and 47 percent of those who supported Trump in the 2020 election said they would not choose to be vaccinated, even if the coronavirus vaccines were made available to them. By contrast, only 10 percent of supporters of President Biden said they would not choose to be vaccinated if offered one, the poll found.  Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, called the poll results “so disturbing” when presented with them Sunday on NBC News’s “Meet the Press.” “How such a large proportion of a certain group of people would not want to get vaccinated merely because of political consideration, it makes absolutely no sense,” Fauci told host Chuck Todd. “And I’ve been saying that for so long. We’ve got to dissociate political persuasion from what’s common-sense, no-brainer public health things.” As he has for weeks, Fauci touted the effectiveness of the three coronavirus vaccines available to U.S. adults, and emphasized the history of vaccines rescuing society from infectious diseases such as smallpox, polio and measles. “What is the problem here? This is a vaccine that is going to be lifesaving for millions of people. How some groups would not want to do it for reasons that I just don’t understand,” Fauci told Todd. Fauci’s alarm mirrored that of other public health experts who have voiced concern about whether the United States can reach herd immunity through vaccines, which they believe could be when between 70 and 85 percent of the population is inoculated. While messaging on vaccine safety has been focused on possible hesitancy among certain racial groups, recent polling suggests the divide could be greater between political groups. Trump, who has pushed people to give him credit for the vaccines, did tell the crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month: “Everybody, go get your shot.” Earlier this month, Trump’s office revealed that the former president had received a vaccine in January before leaving the White House but did not publicize it. However, Trump did not participate in a recent public service announcement by the Ad Council that featured all of the other living former presidents encouraging Americans to get vaccinated, an omission Fauci said was “puzzling.”    The Ad Council is launching a national campaign to promote taking available coronavirus vaccines and a website with answers about their safety. (Video: Ad Council)    Any push by Trump “would make all the difference in the world,” Fauci said on “Fox News Sunday.” “He’s a very widely popular person among Republicans,” he added. On “Fox News Sunday,” Fauci said that accelerating vaccinations and recent drops in daily cases and deaths are encouraging, but that he remained concerned about what could be a recent leveling off in the decline in new infections. “When you see a plateauing at a level of anywhere between 50,000 and 65,000 cases a day, that is absolutely no time to declare victory, because we know from previous surges we’ve had over the year that when you see that leveling off at a high level, there’s always a risk of a surge back up,” Fauci said. “And, in fact, unfortunately, that’s exactly what’s happening in Europe right now.” Fauci said it would be “ill-advised” to ease restrictions on gatherings, and he said the decision earlier this month by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) to lift a statewide mask mandate and open businesses was “risky and potentially dangerous.” “If you look at the numbers, we’re not out of the woods yet,” Fauci said. In his first prime-time address as president Thursday, Biden vowed that all U.S. adults would be eligible for vaccination no later than May 1, and that he was confident that friends and family members would be able to gather in small groups by July 4 to celebrate the Independence Day holiday. He also urged people to trust in the vaccines’ safety and effectiveness and encouraged people to talk to family, friends and neighbors about getting the shots when it’s their turn. “Talk to your family, friends, your neighbors. The people you know best have gotten the vaccine. We need everyone to get vaccinated,” Biden said.  Tory Newmyer and Steven Mufson contributed to this report.

He doesn’t have the same political infrastructure he did three months ago as president,’ added GOP strategist Matt Gorman, who previously served as communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee,” the article continues. \\nSurprisingly, in his semi-tropical retreat, Trump is behaving not like “the political godzilla many expected him to be,” but instead has “maintained close ties to GOP officials who have committed to supporting incumbents, stayed almost entirely out of the spotlight, delivered fairly anodyne remarks the one time he emerged, and offered only sparse criticism of his successor, Joe Biden.”\\nEven worse, “the cumulative result is political whiplash, as the former president shifts from wanting to support the GOP with his resources and grassroots appeal one day to refocusing on his own brand and thirst for vengeance the next,” Politico opines.\\nUnsurprisingly, Trump’s erratic post-White House maneuvers are rooted in a relentless pursuit of his own self-interest.\\n “For any normal politician, it would look like he’s trying to have it both ways but really he’s trying to have it his way,’ said a former Trump White House official. ‘He only cares about maintaining his power and his stranglehold over the Republican Party and it doesn’t matter to him how any of the moves he makes affect the long-term success of institutions or individuals other than himself.’” \\nIn other words, Donald Trump is behaving outside of there Oval Office exactly like he did when he was still the commander-in-chief.\\n\\n“One former administration official who has been in contact with Trump described him as a ‘pinball,’ noting that his tendency to abruptly change directions or seize on a new idea after speaking with a friend or outside adviser — a habit that often frustrated aides during his time in office — has carried into his post-presidency life,” Politico writes.\\n“’You’ve got Trump making endorsements of people without going through the process he agreed to three days ago,’ said the former White House official. ‘It’s really disorganized.’”\\n“’Politics is his hobby and he’s having fun with his hobby in between his rounds of golf,’ said a former Trump adviser. ‘His big test is does he run again? Because if he doesn’t, you’ll see people lose interest in the guy in the next hour. As long as he plays the theatrics he’s going to run again, he still garners attention and creates headlines.’”\\n\\nThe best proof that the former GOP leader was losing his influence on the Republican Party is that fact that the party is now ignoring his entreaties to cease using his name and likeness in their fund-raising appeals even after he called on his supporters to only contribute to Trump’s own political action committee.\\nIn the end, Trump may not face sting of “cancel culture” affecting his future political prospects as his own incompetence — as well as the multiple lawsuits he is likely to face in the months ahead — compete the job of ending his political relevance more quickly and effectively than any wave of public sentiment can accomplish.\\nIt couldn’t happen to a more deserving individual.\\n Follow   Vinnie Longobardo on     Twitter  .\\xa0  \\n Original reporting by\\xa0Gabby Orr and Meridith Mc Graw at Politico. \\n We want to hear what YOU have to say.

Officials discovered the recording of the conversation between Trump and Frances Watson, the lead elections investigator for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in a trash folder on Watson\\'s device while responding to a public records request, according to a source familiar with the internal process.  The Wall Street Journal was first to report the audio. \"You have the most important job in the country right now,\" Trump told Watson, who was leading an audit of absentee ballot signatures in Cobb County at the time, according to the audio. \"Because if we win Georgia ... the people of Georgia are so angry at what happened to me, they know I won,\" he continued, repeating the false claim that he won the state. President Joe Biden won Georgia by 12,670 votes, according Georgia\\'s certified election results. \"When the right answer comes out, you\\'ll be praised,\" Trump told Watson at another point in the call, adding, \"People will say \\'great,\\' because that\\'s what it\\'s about, the ability to check and to make it right, because everyone knows it\\'s wrong.\"  Earlier reporting by NBC News and other news organizations, including The Washington Post, misquoted the exact words Trump used to urge Watson to look for fraud based on Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs\\' account of Watson\\'s recollection of the conversation. \"After hearing the tape, it\\'s clear that [Watson\\'s] recollection accurately portrayed the president\\'s assertions that there was fraud to uncover and that she would receive praise for doing so,\" Fuchs said Monday in a statement to NBC News. In a statement Monday, Trump expressed appreciation for The Post\\'s correction while repeating the false claims of widespread election fraud in Georgia that he made in the months after Biden won the election. During the conversation, which took place Dec. 23, Trump said his chief of staff at the time, Mark Meadows, suggested he call Watson after Meadows visited Cobb County the day before. At one point, Trump, referring to the process of matching voters\\' signatures on file with the elections office and the signatures on their ballots, said he hoped Watson was reviewing older signatures, rather than just the most up-to-date ones on file for voters. \"If you go back two years, and if you can get to Fulton, you\\'re going to find things that are going to be unbelievable, the dishonesty that we\\'ve heard from, just, good sources, really good sources,\" Trump said before claiming without evidence that Fulton County, a Democratic stronghold and home to Atlanta, was the \"mother lode\" of such fraud. \"I appreciate your comments,\" Watson responded. She admitted that she was \"shocked\" that he had taken the time to call her. \"Whatever you can do, Frances, it would be — it\\'s a great thing,\" Trump told her, according to the audio. \"It\\'s an important thing for the country. So important. You\\'ve no idea. So important. And I very much appreciate it.\" Watson said her team was \"only interested in the truth\" and \"finding the information that\\'s based on the facts.\" Trump then asked whether her team of investigators would continue working past Christmas to \"keep it going fast.\" \"Because, you know, we have that date of the 6th, which is a very important date,\" he said, apparently referring to the joint session of Congress to formalize the Electoral College results. A pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6 in an attempt to disrupt the process of formalizing Biden\\'s election victory. Trump also made calls to Raffensperger and Republican Gov. Brian Kemp as part of his efforts to overturn the results of the election, particularly in Georgia, which he became the first GOP candidate in nearly 30 years to lose. During the call with Raffensperger, which took place in early January before the Capitol riot, Trump pleaded with him to \"find\" enough votes to overturn the results and deliver him the state.

Sign up for the daily Inside Washington email for exclusive US coverage and analysis sent to your inbox Get our free Inside Washington email    Former president Donald Trump has fuelled speculation that his daughter-in-law Lara Trump will run for Senate in North Carolina. Mr Trump made the off-hand comment during an impromptu speech at a Mar-A-Lago fundraiser for Big Dog Ranch Rescue. There has been speculation for quite some time that Lara Trump, wife of Eric Trump, the former president’s second son, will make a run for the North Carolina Senate seat currently held by Richard Burr, who announced in 2016 that he will not seek re-election in 2022. Mr Burr voted to convict Mr Trump in his second impeachment trial.  The speech was shared on Twitter by WPTV reporter Tim Allan Walker.  \"I didn\\'t exactly prepare for this, but I was walking by, and I heard everyone screaming,\" Mr Trump said.  He then mentioned his daughter-in-law, who was one of the organisers behind the event meant to facilitate the rescue of dogs from China. \"I want to thank Lara, who\\'s been so incredible, I don\\'t know, you\\'re running for the Senate. I hear she\\'s going to run for the Senate!\" he said to loud cheers from the assembled crowd.   Read more:  Lara Trump: Will the president’s daughter-in-law build a future political dynasty?  Ms Trump has not announced nor ruled out a run for the Senate.  The former president said the fundraiser was \"so great and so important,\" adding \"I\\'m with you 100 per cent. We had many meetings in the White House and the Oval Office having to do with saving and helping dogs.\" Mr Trump was the first president to not have a dog in the White House in over 100 years. According to  The Washington Post, Mr Trump said while speaking about dogs to a crowd in 2019: “I wouldn’t mind having one, honestly, but I don’t have any time. How would I look walking a dog on the White House lawn?” The goal of the fundraiser was to raise half a million dollars to rescue 500 dogs from China. It was hosted by Lauree Simmons, the president and founder of Big Dog Ranch Rescue.  The charity has spent almost $2m dollars at Trump properties over the last seven years and it was estimated before the event that the charity will spend another $225,000 dollars at Mar-A-Lago this weekend, The Huffington Post reported.   Ms Trump started being listed as chairwoman of the charity events in 2018 and Ms Simmons was at the White House in 2019 during the signing ceremony for a bill targeting animal cruelty.  Ms Simmons has shared social media posts indicating her support for the false claims that the election was stolen from Mr Trump. On 3 January, three days before the attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, she posted an image on Facebook with the words: “Either we TAKE power back or we will never be free again. No more asking nicely.” South Carolina Senator and Trump confidant Lindsey Graham said in mid-February that Mr Burr\\'s vote to convict Mr Trump during his second impeachment trial made it “almost certain” that Lara Trump would be nominated to replace him.  He told Fox News: “The biggest winner I think of this whole impeachment trial is Lara Trump. My dear friend Richard Burr, who I like and I’ve been friends to a long time, just made Lara Trump almost a certain nominee for the Senate seat in North Carolina to replace him if she runs. Now certainly I would be behind her because she represents the future of the Republican Party.”  The Independent has reached out to the North Carolina Republican Party for comment.   \\n  \\n Washington\\n CNN\\n \\xa0—\\xa0\\n \\n\\n \\n Trump’s personal Boeing 757 was always the crown jewel of his wealth – the ultimate sign that he had made it. He’s used it as a backdrop for sleek photo shoots, campaign rallies, VIP tours, for shots of him eating his Big Macs and KFC, plated, with a knife and fork. Trump loved to show it off – the customized cream-colored leather seats, gilded bathrooms, the seat buckles layered in 24-karat gold. \\n \\n \\n But today it sits idle on an airport ramp in Orange County, New York, about 60 miles north of Manhattan.\\n \\n \\n One engine is missing parts. The other is shrink-wrapped in plastic. The cost to fix and get it flyable could reach well into the high six-figures, a price-tag Trump doesn’t appear to be dealing with right now. Though the current state of his finances aren’t public, the Covid-19 pandemic has taken a toll on the hospitality industry home to so many of his businesses. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Flight records accessed by CNN show the 757 hasn’t been flown at all since Inauguration Day, when Trump’s use of Air Force One ended, leaving him to less showy modes of transport. \\n \\n \\n A representative for the Trump Organization did not immediately return CNN’s request for comment as to why the plane is not being used, nor has been fixed – and whether or not Trump intends to get it in flying shape anytime soon. \\n \\n \\n A CNN camera crew saw Trump’s plane parked on a fenced-off tarmac at the small upstate New York airport on Wednesday, about an hour and a half drive from Trump Tower. The choice to leave it outside at a northeastern airport, exposed to the elements, has baffled aviation experts who spoke with CNN. They note that it’s just a few hours’ flight to warmer, more arid climes. Snow, rain, and moisture can lead to metal corrosion of the airframe and the engines – hard to detect, and, in severe cases, catastrophic. Large airplanes are typically stored for long stretches of time in the desert southwest, where the dry climate makes corrosion nearly impossible. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Trump rarely, if ever, admits to losing power. With the 757 apparently out of commission, Trump is left with his much smaller corporate jet, at least for now. According to flight data, Trump’s 1997 Cessna 750 Citation X has been in semi-regular rotation for the last few months, often flying between Palm Beach International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in New York. \\n \\n \\n It was this plane Trump flew on when he made his first post-presidency trip back to Manhattan earlier this month. “The small jet isn’t his favorite,” says a former White House official who frequently flew with Trump on both planes. With just eight seats, the Citation such as the one Trump is using, is a tighter squeeze and far less luxe than the 757. \\n \\n \\n “It also doesn’t have his name on the outside,” the source said, noting the gigantic Trump name that the 757 bears across its front section. The Citation does have a small Trump family crest on the fuselage. That’s a downgrade for a man who likes to paint his surname on just about everything he owns, from hotels to bottles of wine. \\n \\n \\n \\n When Donald Trump bought the used Boeing 757 airplane in 2010 from the late Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen, it swiftly became his favorite toy, as he liked to tell friends. Though it was already almost twenty years old, for the next decade, Trump lauded his plane. He was picky about who got to fly on it, where they would sit and how they could move about, says another frequent flier. None of the regular travelers were willing to speak on the record for fear of retribution. \\n \\n \\n In 2015, just two months prior to announcing his initial candidacy for President, Trump invited some journalists in Iowa aboard for an impromptu press conference – then chastised them for almost messing up his baby.\\n \\n \\n “There’s one guy very dangerous with that one camera. I’m talking and I’m watching that camera which is about this far from the ceiling, knowing that my day is going to be ruined if they ruin the ceiling,” said Trump according to a Des Moines Register report. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Later, a journalist dropped a piece of equipment onto one of the plane’s specially designed mahogany coffee tables. When the journalist apologized, Trump said, “You’re sorry? I’m sorry, too.” \\n \\n \\n When he hit the campaign trail in earnest, the 757, aka “Trump Force One,” became as much a promotional ploy as billboards or TV ads. Look how successful I am– was the message Trump was sending to voters, sometimes parking it behind the stage at his rallies. \\n \\n \\n Trump’s flash-and-cash boasting worked all the way to the White House, with many of his supporters lured by the informercial-like, almost hypnotic reel of planes, limos, homes, glamorous women, gold, and quasi-celebrity. His gilded, high-flying brand may be the most valuable thing he owns. The New York Times found his personal brand strategy to be “the most successful part of the Trump business,” as part of their September review of Trump tax returns. \\n \\n \\n \\n But, like many Trump accoutrements crafted for the purpose of marketing, the reality of the giant jet was different behind the scenes. It was a money suck, a plane past its prime with decaying mechanics and exorbitant storage fees. \\n \\n \\n “Flying that thing was so expensive,” says the former senior official. “I don’t think people realized that just to get it up in the air and make one stop was literally tens of thousands of dollars.” \\n \\n \\n The cost to fly a Boeing 757 is about $15,000 to $18,000 per hour, according to CNN aviation analyst David Soucie. But that’s when the plane can actually fly. Trump’s 757 is nowhere near flight ready, according to an experienced pilot who saw it this week. The source declined to be identified. \\n \\n \\n “It’s an older engine and parts availability is becoming a challenge so operating costs go up significantly,” says Soucie. “Most airlines are retiring the 757 since more cost-effective models are now available.” \\n \\n \\n During the presidential campaign, Trump talked up the powerful Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofan engines on his 757, saying he personally insisted on having the 500-mph engines installed. “They’re special, they’re really popular, the most popular,” said Trump in a 2013 documentary about the plane. In reality, the engines are standard on this particular model of Boeing 757. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Soucie says right now, at least one of the plane’s Rolls-Royce engines appears in need of major maintenance. “Fixing one of those engines would easily cost six figures,” he says. \\n \\n \\n The life of a jet engine is limited by the hours in operation and what’s called cycles—a measure of how many times an engine is turned on. Once the engine reaches a number of hours or cycles predetermined by manufacturer and the federal regulators, an inspection of the engine’s critical “hot section” becomes required by law. \\n \\n \\n Before Trump purchased it from Paul Allen, the plane served as a commercial airliner in Mexico in the 1990s, according to a 2016 Times story on the plane. \\n \\n \\n “If the wear is serious, that could lead to replacing the engine and that could cost up to a million dollars,” says Soucie. \\n \\n \\n The pricey extravagance of the jet may now be too much for Trump’s finances to handle. His net worth has taken a tumble over the last few years. Trump is personally liable for debts and loans totaling $421 million, according to the New York Times reporting. Most of that debt comes due in the next four years. Some of his best-known business ventures report losing millions, if not tens of millions, of dollars year after year, according to the Times. That includes golf courses that have racked up at least $315 million in losses over the past two decades. The Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. \\n \\n \\n A Bloomberg News report this week estimates that Trump’s net worth has fallen by $700 million since February 2016, from $3 billion to $2.3 billion. \\n \\n \\n Trump could use money in his political action committees to pay for the plane upgrades, or other expenses, experts say. “PACs are often used as slush funds,” said Paul S. Ryan, an expert on campaign finance and a top lawyer at Common Cause, a good governance non-profit. \\n \\n \\n “Campaign finance law doesn’t require PAC money to be used for political purposes, leaving open the possibility that Trump could use PAC funds to pay for private plane repairs.” \\n \\n \\n The disclosures for Trump’s newest PACs aren’t due for some time, so it’s unclear if he has spent any of that money on maintaining the plane. \\n \\n \\n But he has used campaign money in the past for travel. When running for president in 2016, for example, Trump used his campaign funds to pay travel expenses to a Trump-owned entity called Tag Air. In all, he spent $8.7 million with Tag Air in that cycle, according to a CNN tally at the time. \\n \\n \\n Trump could always just sell the plane. It’s what he typically does with spare pieces of real estate, including a home adjacent to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, which just this month listed for $49 million, $31 million more than what he paid for it in 2018. But unlike real estate, planes are depreciating assets, no matter how much gold plating they contain, and Trump’s 757 is not worth nearly what it was when it rolled off the assembly line in 1991. \\n \\n \\n The 2013 Trump-sanctioned documentary about the plane says Trump paid $100 million for it. Even if he paid far less than that, similar 757’s are currently up for sale at a market price of about $7 million - $10 million. \\n \\n \\n \\n Regardless of what he paid for it, Trump didn’t cut corners on customizing his new plane. \\n \\n \\n “He was very involved in the design,” says Eric Roth, president of Long Island-based International Jet Interiors, a company that outfits the private jets of some of the world’s wealthiest individuals. “We met a number of times to go over exactly what he wanted.” \\n \\n \\n It was Roth whom Trump initially contacted when he discovered Allen’s plane was up for sale. “I flew out to Redmond, Washington, and inspected it, and told him what I thought,” says Roth, who got to work on the six-month overhaul to deck it out almost immediately after Trump closed on the purchase in 2010. \\n \\n \\n A standard 757 seats about 228 passengers; Trump’s was tricked out for just 43, with a master bedroom, guest suite, dining room, VIP area and galley. “Anything metal on that plane’s interior – lights, seat buckles, handles, latches, knobs – we did in 24-karat gold plating,” says Roth, adding the price for that alone came to around a “quarter million.” \\n \\n \\n Roth said he and Trump discussed “what will make this fitting for Donald Trump,” and “how do we make it regal?” They landed on cremes and gold tones, and mahogany and suede paneling. \\n \\n \\n “He went with very classic materials and designs, things that are timeless,” says Roth. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n The fabrics, which Roth described as “more formal,” were flown in from Paris. The Trump family crest was embroidered into the headrests of the seats with gold thread. Roth said Melania Trump had nothing to do with the design and décor of the plane. It was Trump’s previous personal aircraft, a 41-year-old Boeing 727 he put up for sale in 2009, that then-Melania Knauss used as a backdrop for her British GQ magazine spread, with the infamous photograph of her lying nude on a rug on one of the jet’s banquettes. \\n \\n \\n The sale of the 727 paved the way for the purchase of the 757; in 2010, Trump’s popularity via “The Apprentice” and “Celebrity Apprentice” was peaking. He wanted a private plane commensurate with his level of success. \\n \\n \\n Trump certainly doesn’t need the 757 to get around. the smaller, lighter Citation would actually make it easier for him to slip in and out of smaller, more private airports. The Citation is also faster and cheaper to operate than a 757. An aircraft charter broker tells CNN the smaller Trump plane would cost about $5,000 per hour to fly. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Thus, the fuel and crew and such are significantly lighter in terms of financial responsibility, the footprint a better fit for someone who may be tightening purse strings. \\n \\n \\n But Trump has never really been a less-is-more kind of guy. \\n \\n \\n The former official questions whether there will ever come a day when Trump would take a commercial flight. “Honestly? I think if it was a choice of flying on a commercial plane or staying home, he would just stay home.” \\n \\n \\n CNN’s Greg Wallace and Fredreka Schouten contributed to this story\\n\\n      The Boeing 757 that once stood for the glitz and glamour of Donald Trump’s high-flying lifestyle now sits idle, ignored and in disrepair, CNN reported Saturday.  The aircraft with its custom cream-colored leather seats and 24-karat gold flourishes currently needs work on both engines and as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars in repairs, according to the network. The plane hasn’t been flown since Inauguration Day, according to flight records, CNN reported, and it sits idle on a fenced-off tarmac at an airport in upstate Orange County, New York, some 60 miles from Manhattan. The plane was dubbed Trump Force One during the former president’s 2016 campaign. Several campaign rallies were held at airports with the plane, emblazoned with his name, as a backdrop. It features a master bedroom, has a 57-inch TV, and can seat 43 passengers. The Trump Organization posted a video tour of the aircraft in 2011. (Check it out below.) After he was elected, Trump switched to taxpayer-funded air transportation. He now relies on his smaller 1997 Cessna 750 Citation X corporate jet, which seats nine people, according to CNN. The cost of operating his mammoth aircraft, which the Trump Organization website has deemed his “crown jewel,” is a financial strain, a source told the network. “Flying that thing was so expensive. I don’t think people realized that just to get it up in the air and make one stop was literally tens of thousands of dollars,” the source said. CNN aviation analyst David Soucie estimated that operating a Boeing 757 can cost up to $18,000 an hour. Trump and his businesses, meanwhile, have been hemorrhaging money and value, and his net worth is estimated to have dropped some $700 million to $2.3 billion since 2017, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The six-minute recording of a phone call between the former president and investigator Frances Watson that took place on 23 December, was published by the  Wall Street Journal  last week. Earlier, the  Washington Post  also reported on the substance of the calls.\\xa0 In the recording, Mr Trump can be heard telling the investigator to find proof of election fraud in Georgia before “the very important date,\" referring to the 20 January inauguration of president Joe Biden. Now, CNN has cited a Georgia official as saying that the recording of the audio was located in the trash folder of Ms Watson’s device. It was also reported that officials in Georgia earlier claimed the recording of the call didn’t exist. The leaked audio is more proof of the former president’s extraordinary attempts to convince officials to help him find evidence for his baseless claims of voter fraud. Mr Trump, who filed over 50 lawsuits and repeatedly claimed the elections were unfair, told Ms Watson to find “the right answer” and that she would be \"praised\" for overturning the results.\\xa0 Encouraging her to look for discrepancies in her signature check for absentee ballots, Mr Trump said: \"But if you go back two years, and if you can get to Fulton, you are going to find things that are going to be unbelievable.”  \"The dishonesty that we’ve heard from.

The state of Georgia is also conducting an independent probe into it.   LOS ANGELES (AP) — A former Playboy model apologized to first lady Melania Trump for a 10-month affair she claims she had with President Donald Trump that started with him offering her money after the first time they had sex. During an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper that aired Thursday night, Karen McDougal said Trump tried to pay her after their first sexual tryst at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2006. “Well, after we had been intimate, he, he tried to pay me. And I actually didn’t know how to take that,” she said. “But I looked at him and I said, ‘That’s not me. I’m not that kind of girl.’” She cried on the way home and didn’t think she would see him again, but agreed to go on other dates with him after he called her back, she said. McDougal repeatedly described Trump as “very charming” and “sweet.” McDougal said she continued the relationship with Trump for about 10 months and broke it off in April 2007 because she felt guilty. She recalled traveling to meet Trump at his properties in New York, New Jersey and California and said she had sex with him “many dozens of times.” McDougal had feelings for Trump, but the affair was “just tearing me apart,” she said. “There was a real relationship there. There were real feelings,” she said. “He would call me baby or he would call me beautiful Karen.” Trump married his current wife, Melania Trump, in 2005, and their son, Barron, was born in 2006. Speaking to CNN — which her attorney has said would be her only interview about the relationship — McDougal apologized when she was asked what she would say to Melania Trump. “What can you say except, I’m sorry?” McDougal said. “I’m sorry. I wouldn’t want it done to me.” McDougal said she never wanted to discuss her relationship and repeatedly rebuffed inquiries from reporters about the alleged affair. But after the story became public, she wanted to get out and tell her side of what happened, she said. The White House has said Trump denies having an affair with McDougal and did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the interview Thursday night. On Tuesday, she filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles against the company that owns the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer, which she said paid her $150,000 during the presidential campaign for the rights to her story of an affair, but never ran the story. McDougal’s lawsuit, which asks a judge to invalidate the contract, alleges that Trump’s attorney, Michael Cohen, was secretly involved in her discussions with the tabloid’s parent company, American Media, Inc. The company has said that McDougal has been allowed to speak about her relationship since 2016 and the contract gave them discretion over whether to publish the story. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect style on first lady. ___ Associated Press writer Jill Colvin in Washington contributed to this report.   The Georgia Secretary of State\\'s office has formally launched an investigation into former President Donald Trump\\'s phone calls to state election officials in which he sought help to overturn the results of the election after President Joe Biden\\'s narrow victory was certified twice. The investigation, which follows a series of formal complaints filed by a law professor alleging that Trump violated the law during those calls, marks the first formal investigation into Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the election in the state. “The Secretary of State’s office investigates complaints it receives,” said Walter Jones, a spokesperson for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger\\'s office. “The investigations are fact-finding and administrative in nature. Any further legal efforts will be left to the Attorney General.” In an initial statement given to ABC News confirming the investigation, Jones said the investigation was being conducted by the State Election Board, which is part of Raffensperger\\'s office. Jones later clarified that the Secretary of State\\'s office would be conducting the investigation.     Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger gives an update on the state of the election and ballot count during a news conference at the State Capitol in Atlanta, Nov. 6, 2020. Dustin Chambers/Reuters, FILE     In Trump’s first call to Georgia officials, made in December amid an ongoing signature match audit, he insisted to the chief investigator in Raffensperger\\'s office that \"something bad happened\" in the state, telling the official, \"When the right answer comes out, you\\'ll be praised,\" according to a recording of the call first obtained by the Wall Street Journal and also obtained by ABC News. In another call on Jan. 2, Trump repeatedly demanded that Raffensperger \"find\" the exact number of votes -- 11,780 -- he needed to be the victor in the Peach State, according to a recording of the call obtained by ABC News. Once the investigation is finished, the board will vote whether or not to send a criminal referral to the state attorney general or district attorney. Fulton County’s top prosecutor, District Attorney Fani Willis, has described the Trump-Raffensperger call as “disturbing,” saying in a statement after the calls first became public that if election officials refer the case to her, she’ll pursue it aggressively. \"As I promised Fulton County voters last year, as District Attorney, I will enforce the law without fear or favor,\" Willis said in a Jan. 4 statement. \"Anyone who commits a felony violation of Georgia law in my jurisdiction will be held accountable. Once the investigation is complete, this matter, like all matters, will be handled by our office based on the facts and the law.\" She could also decide on her own to pursue a probe, her associates said.     Voters stand in line before the doors open at Cobb County Community Center, Jan. 5, 2021, in Atlanta. Megan Varner/Getty Images, FILE     \"I know D.A. Willis, and she will move it as fast as possible, but she’s not going to move it forward just to satisfy anyone, Democrat or Republican,\" said Joshua D. Morrison, former senior assistant Fulton County district attorney and Willis colleague. Morrison said he believes it is likely Willis will investigate the Trump calls, even though her office has given no official indication that it is preparing to do so. \"I have never seen anything like this,\" Morrison said of the call. \"And people in Georgia don’t like to be messed with. So I don’t think Trump is going to find a friendly audience here if they do decide to go forward on this case.\" \"I am very happy the Secretary of State\\'s office has opened an investigation into this matter, as I have been calling for since early January. I look forward to reviewing their report and deciding whether to refer the case to the Attorney General or District Attorney,\" David Worley, the lone Democrat on the State Election Board, told ABC News. Investigations by the secretary of state\\'s office can take months to complete, but it marks a major development on the eve of Trump’s second impeachment trial. The single article of impeachment against the president, which accuses him of inciting the deadly riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, briefly mentions the phone call with the secretary. Trump’s impeachment lawyers defended Trump’s actions on the call in a brief submitted to the House the last week and “denied that President Trump acted improperly in that telephone call in any way.” In a statement sent to ABC News on Monday, Jason Miller, Trump\\'s senior adviser, said, \"There was nothing improper or untoward about a scheduled call between President Trump, Secretary Raffensperger and lawyers on both sides. If Mr. Raffensperger didn’t want to receive calls about the election, he shouldn’t have run for Secretary of State. And the only reason the call became public was because Mr. Raffensperger leaked it in an attempt to score political points.”     Voters stand in line to cast their ballots during the first day of early voting in the US Senate runoff at the Gwinnett Fairgrounds, Dec. 14, 2020, in Atlanta. Tami Chappell/AFP via Getty Images, FILE     Trump also defended his call while speaking at a rally in D.C. on Jan. 6. \"I thought it was a great conversation,\" he said. \"People loved that the conversation.\" \"I can\\'t believe this guy is a Republican,\" Trump said, referring to Raffensperger. \"He loves recording telephone conversations.\" The complaint, which was filed Monday by George Washington University Law Professor John F. Banzhaf, alleges Trump may have violated three Georgia state laws, including conspiracy to commit election fraud, criminal solicitation to commit election fraud, and intentional interference with performance of election duties. “Many prominent and knowledgeable attorneys have concluded … that the evidence which is now currently and publicly available already meets the very high criminal standard of proving each and every element of the crimes beyond any reasonable doubt,” Banzhaf wrote in the complaint, which was his fourth one submitted. Anyone is able to file a complaint with the elections division of the secretary’s office, Raffensperger\\'s office told ABC News. If the complaint is deemed credible, it will be investigated.     President Donald Trump gestures as he speaks at a rally to support Republican Senate candidates at Valdosta Regional Airport in Valdosta, Georgia, Dec. 5, 2020. Andrew Caballero-reynolds/AFP via Getty Images, FILE     Banzhaf filed the complaint through an online portal on the secretary’s website, the spokesperson said. The emailed complaint was sent to the board, Willis and Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr. Banzhaf asked the board to adopt a motion to refer a criminal investigation to Carr and Willis’s offices to pursue. The five-member State Election Board, which Raffensperger sits on, has investigatory power over “election laws and frauds and irregularities,” according to a description of its duties on the secretary’s website. If legal violations are discovered, the board must report them to the attorney general or relevant district attorney, who is then responsible for further investigating the matter and prosecution, if applicable.   This story has been updated to include a clarification from Brad Raffensperger\\'s office. The Secretary of State\\'s office, not the State Election Board, will be conducting the investigation.   Editor\\'s note: A previous version of this story stated that during a December call, former President Donald Trump told a Georgia elections investigator to \"find the fraud\" and that she would be a \"national hero\" for it, according to an individual familiar with the matter. ABC News has since obtained a recording of the call, and Trump did not say those exact words. This story has been updated to remove those quotes.   \\n In case you haven’t noticed, DONALD TRUMP has every intention of throwing his weight around in Republican primaries in 2022. And whether it’s for an incumbent looking to ward off an intraparty threat or a challenger aiming to knock off a sitting senator, his endorsement matters a lot. Even candidates in safe seats stand to raise a ton of money if they can manage to secure Trump’s imprimatur.  With that in mind, here’s Playbook’s nine-step guide to securing a Trump endorsement, based on our conversations with five people advising him from his new perch at Mar-a-Lago. A big caveat here: As with everything Trump, it starts and ends with his gut.  1) If you have Trump’s number, you have a leg up in the process. He takes his own calls.   2) If you don’t, you’ll probably need an entree via his gatekeepers. The three chiefs on this are JASON MILLER, JUSTIN CLARK and STEPHEN MILLER. COREY LEWANDOWSKI is running the Trump super PAC, so his influence is ascending. Others who can get the president on the phone include DAN SCAVINO, DAVE BOSSIE, MARK MEADOWS, BILL STEPIEN, Rep. MATT GAETZ (R-Fla.) and SEAN HANNITY. Keep in mind some of them are pushing for candidates who have hired them to consult and are now their clients. “You don’t need to hire someone to get to Trump, you just need to know someone who can get you in front of him,” a former aide said.   3) Even better is a family connection: DONALD TRUMP JR. and ERIC TRUMP have a lot of sway over their father’s political business. IVANKA TRUMP and JARED KUSHNER have yet to weigh in, but when they do, it will matter.  4) If you’ve trashed Trump in the past, you have your work cut out. He does take people back, as we know, but a hard red line for him now is if you came out against him after Jan. 6 (see: NIKKI HALEY).  5) If you’re primarying one of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach him, you have a big head start. Trump is hellbent on revenge against those lawmakers. He’s already backed his former aide MAX MILLER, in a primary against Rep. ANTHONY GONZALEZ (R-Ohio), and met with Rep. ADAM KINZINGER’S (R-Ill.) primary challenger, CATALINA LAUF, at Mar-a-Lago.  6) If you’re a member of his private beach club or know a member, you can have proximate access to him. He’s often seen dining on the patio with his political advisers behind a red rope.  7) Renting space at Mar-a-Lago for your fundraiser through a member will get his attention. Trump has come down from his dinners to bless Utah Sen. MIKE LEE and South Dakota Gov. KRISTI NOEM, who held their fundraisers at his club. He gave a 10-minute speech, cracked a few jokes and then gave them a hearty endorsement. It’s unclear if he’ll do the same at LYNDA BLANCHARD’S fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago this weekend for the Alabama Senate seat. Noem raised $300,000 at an event there hosted by Trump Jr. and KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE.   8) Sen. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-S.C.), who’s in Palm Beach this weekend to see Trump and will likely be back next week, has become the GOP establishment’s Trump whisperer. Graham is cajoling the former president to endorse incumbents who don’t wave the Trump flag — people like Sens. MIKE CRAPO of Idaho, JOHN BOOZMAN of Arkansas and JERRY MORAN of Kansas. “I said these folks, they show up to work every day, they work hard, they are just good solid reliable Republicans who helped his agenda,” Graham told Playbook. “I think President Trump wants to be helpful. I expect more of this to come.” (One caveat: Graham drew Trump’s ire after helping secure his endorsement of Nebraska Sen. BEN SASSE for reelection — only to see Sasse continue to harshly criticize the president.)   9) Be famous. Trump has already effectively endorsed former football star HERSCHEL WALKER for Senate in Georgia even though he hasn’t said he’s running.   Good Saturday morning. Daylight savings is upon us — remember to spring forward an hour at 2 a.m. Sunday — and with it the annual debate over whether to make it permanent. Some lawmakers say they really mean it this time. WaPo: “Spring forward forever? Lawmakers consider keeping daylight saving time year-round”: “What if we advanced the clocks this weekend and never had to turn them back? The idea is gaining some traction after a bipartisan group of U.S. senators this week reintroduced a bill that would eliminate standard time and keep daylight saving time year-round.  “The Sunshine Protection Act, proposed by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), along with four Republican and three Democratic senators, says we should ditch standard time since we only use it four months of the year, from November to March. ‘The call to end the antiquated practice of clock changing is gaining momentum throughout the nation,’ Rubio said in a statement.”  Got a news tip?

DIPLOS MAD ABOUT VAXXING — Foreign diplomats across D.C. and the country have acted as essential workers by keeping their embassies and consulates open during the pandemic — and they’re frustrated the State Department isn’t treating them that way. Considered VIPs within their own governments, these foreign government workers expected that they would get the same status in the U.S. as  other   essential government workers. But they’ve been told that they have to wait in line for the vaccine like the rest of us.  According to a February memo, the State Department told the missions they would be “treated no differently than U.S. citizens with respect [to] their eligibility to receiving their Covid-19 vaccine in line with the vaccine distribution plans in the district in which they reside.” The Consular Corps in California conducted a survey that they submitted to the state government arguing that since they are constantly being exposed to the public in their work, they should be deemed essential government workers — or at least have the same status as workers like cashiers or teachers.   “We shouldn’t have special treatment, but we should have treatment in line with our jobs,” a senior foreign diplomat told Playbook. “We have been considered essential workers and that’s the reason why our offices didn’t close,” except for a brief period at the outset of the pandemic. As for American officials abroad, so many countries are so far behind the U.S. in terms of vaccine distribution that the State Department plans to send their missions vaccines in the coming weeks.  BIDEN’S SATURDAY — President JOE BIDEN and VP KAMALA HARRIS have nothing on their public schedules.\\n THE WHITE HOUSE   WAPO: “After 50 days as president, Biden still hasn’t given a news conference. Critics and allies wonder why”: “The seven-week stretch is the longest a new president has gone without meeting the press in the past 100 years, dating back to when Calvin Coolidge, a man known as ‘Silent Cal,’ was president, according to research by the American Presidency Project at the University of California at Santa Barbara.  “Biden delivered his first prime-time address to the nation Thursday night — but it appears the nation will wait longer to see him respond to questions at his first presidential news conference. He has often taken a question or two from reporters at the end of speeches or statements, as he did Wednesday after remarks about an increase in the coronavirus vaccine supply. But his record as president so far mirrors his behavior as a candidate, when Biden gave several interviews but rarely interacted with a roomful of reporters.”  CONGRESS   SCHUMER AND GILLIBRAND JOIN THE HERD —“Cuomo Says He Won’t Bow to ‘Cancel Culture’ and Rejects Calls to Resign,”  NYT: “By the end of the day, Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, two of the state’s most powerful Democrats, had also called on Mr. Cuomo to resign.  “‘Due to the multiple, credible sexual harassment and misconduct allegations, it is clear that Governor Cuomo has lost the confidence of his governing partners and the people of New York,’ the senators said in a joint statement late Friday afternoon. ‘Governor Cuomo should resign.’”  — Also via NYT:  “Why Al Franken Hovers Over the Debate About Cuomo’s Future”    ALWAYS BE PREPARED —  “McConnell Backs New Process to Fill Kentucky Senate Vacancy,” Bloomberg: “Mitch McConnell has given his blessing to legislation to change how a vacant U.S. Senate seat would be filled in his home state of Kentucky, but it most certainly doesn\\'t signal an opening is contemplated, an ally of the Senate Republican leader said Friday.  “The bill was advanced by a Kentucky House committee, leaving it one step away from clearing the GOP-dominated legislature.

The tight time frame is driven by a May 1 deadline to withdraw the remaining U.S. troops from Afghanistan, as required under a deal with the Taliban that President Biden inherited from the Trump administration.  Biden has not decided whether to proceed with the withdrawal, U.S. officials said. The troop level, which was announced as 2,500, is temporarily as much as 1,000 higher, because of overlaps as units arrive before departing ones leave, officials said. The Afghan government was left out of the Trump agreement. So without a broader diplomatic deal to restrain Taliban fighters, the Afghan government’s control over key population areas, including the capital, Kabul, is likely to rapidly deteriorate, especially if the American pullout goes ahead, the Pentagon said. “If we withdraw and no deal was made with the Taliban, I think the government of Afghanistan is going to be in for a very stiff fight to retain possession” of towns and cities, Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the top U.S. commander in the Middle East, said in an interview Saturday after talks in Kabul.  The danger that Afghanistan could rapidly descend into deeper violence and chaos that would allow Al Qaeda to reemerge has led Biden to try to pull off a diplomatic breakthrough, though neither the Afghan government nor the Taliban seems eager to reach a deal. The Taliban, which took power in 1996, was driven out of Kabul five years later when the United States invaded in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by Al Qaeda, the militant group led by Osama bin Laden that had taken refuge in Afghanistan.  If there is no deal by May 1, Biden could decide to keep U.S. forces in place temporarily to give the peace talks more time or keep them there indefinitely. But that would probably prompt the Taliban to renew attacks on American troops — assaults that have mostly stopped since the U.S.-Taliban deal in February 2020, officials said.

(Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times)    Since then, the Taliban has increased attacks on the Afghan military and civilians, especially in the south in Kandahar and Helmand provinces.  Army Gen. Austin “Scott” Miller, the top American commander in Kabul, warned that a U.S. withdrawal would leave the Afghan armed forces without vital support, especially for its fledgling air force, which relies on contractors to maintain its planes and helicopters. “When you start talking about removing our presence … certain things like air, air support and maintenance of that air support becomes more and more problematic,” Miller said in an interview. All U.S. military personnel and thousands of contractors who help maintain equipment and supply Afghan troops would have to leave the country under the deal former President Trump made with the Taliban. An additional 6,500 military personnel in Afghanistan from NATO and other allies would also probably depart.

(Rahmat Gul / Associated Press)    Among Afghan soldiers, there is growing resignation that they may have to fight on alone, even with the new U.S. administration seeking to jump start peace talks. “To me, the Americans have already left. Fighting the enemy is now our own responsibility and we will continue to persevere,” said Mohammad Sediq, 30, the commander of an Afghan army outpost in the eastern province of Laghman.  The base that sits in a broad valley known as Levano Dara was in an area once patrolled by American troops. Now it is defended by 20 Afghan troops and flanked by mountains held by Taliban fighters, who plant bombs on the roads at night.  The road leading from Kabul to the province has become more dangerous, with insurgents high up in the mountains attacking vehicles driving through the valley. Five people in a United Nations convoy were killed when it was attacked on the road in February.  “The deal between the U.S. and the Taliban is between them,” said Sediq, sitting on a stone wall overlooking both the base and the sprawling valley. “It doesn’t benefit us. It doesn’t benefit the average Afghan.” Fawzia Koofi, an Afghan government peace negotiator, says progress in the talks is possible. But she also doesn’t believe the Taliban has given up its goal of returning to power and reimposing its harsh brand of Islamic law. The Taliban’s rise came after civil war fractured Afghanistan following the withdrawal of troops from the Soviet Union in 1989.  A power-sharing agreement with the Afghan government might moderate the Taliban, Koofi said.  “We have to agree on a political peace, knowing that they haven’t changed,” she said. “If the Taliban finds a way to practice their ideas in a more open society, they will probably change over time.” But there are few promising signs of peace. Biden’s Afghan negotiator, Zalmay Khalilzad, and other U.S. officials have been working in the region since last month, pushing both sides to revive peace talks that stalled over deep disagreements on the country’s future. The U.S. has proposed a 90-day reduction in violence, a U.N.-led conference on sharing power, and an April meeting in Istanbul to finalize an agreement. The Afghan government said over the weekend that it would attend the Turkey meeting, but President Ashraf Ghani has publicly rejected ceding power to an interim government that includes the Taliban.    Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, shown this month at the start of a legislative session, has said he would not cede power to an interim government that includes the Taliban. (Associated Press)    “We will participate in the meetings,” Hamdullah Mohib, Afghanistan’s national security advisor, told reporters Saturday. But he added that an interim government “would take the country nowhere.” The Taliban is also expected to participate in the talks, but the militant group has given no signal so far that it is willing to accept a delay in the U.S. withdrawal date or reduce its high level of attacks on Afghan forces, officials said. Khalilzad is exploring whether the Taliban might soften its position in return for easing of sanctions on its leaders, release of prisoners held by the Afghan government or other even more far-reaching steps, officials said. The U.S. and its allies are also asking Pakistan’s security services, which have long backed the Taliban and allowed its leaders to live openly on its territory near the border, to pressure their proxies to negotiate. McKenzie was in Kabul on Saturday for talks with Ghani. Miller, who met last week with Taliban officials in Qatar, has urged them to reduce attacks on Afghan troops in hopes of improving the climate for peace talks. But rather than reducing attacks as the U.S. hoped, the militant group has fought to encircle cities in the country’s south, and even kept up attacks near Kabul during the unusually mild Afghan winter, a time when fighting historically has subsided.  The Taliban has also carried out a large number of assassinations targeting activists, journalists and government officials, Miller said. The militant group is insistent that the U.S. abide by the May 1 deadline for leaving, he said.

(Rahmat Gul / Associated Press)    “They are using violence and they are trying to put themselves in a position, if the things they want are not met … to force decisions in the political space,” Miller said in an interview. At the Afghan military outpost in Levano Dara — which translates to wolves valley — soldiers said they hold on to the hope that they are winning the war. The alternative, they said, is too bleak.  “On the ground, fighting is getting worse, while our leaders sit far away in Doha [Qatar]. I don’t have a lot of faith in the process,” said Mahmoud Bakhshi, 23. “All I see is more violence, more war.” In nearby Kandarar, a village 90 miles from Kabul, 60-year-old Mohammed Harun says he has little hope that developments in Doha, which he follows via his small radio and a neighbor’s television, will benefit people like him. The small farming community of a handful of mud compounds, surrounded by fields and a backdrop of snowless mountains, has seen little improvement in government services over the last two decades. Even though the village is near the province’s main highway, villagers have neither steady electricity nor paved roads; access to clean water comes by one pump, shared by the whole village. At best, Harun believes, the government and the Taliban might sign a deal that would keep the country from drifting into civil war and keep the army from disintegrating. At worst, a premature U.S.-withdrawal could result in more violence and chaos — a scenario Harun has seen before, when Soviet troops left Afghanistan. “We want the Americans to leave, but not like this,” the community leader said. “They need to take responsibility and clean up the mess they created. We need the guarantee from them and from our neighbors that the Taliban regime won’t repeat itself.”  Times staff writer Cloud reported from Kabul and special correspondent Glinski from Laghman province.      Former President Donald Trump  thought Meghan Markle was \"no good\" following her bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey last week but felt publicly saying so would cause the sort of backlash experienced by British TV host Piers Morgan after he openly criticized the Duchess of Sussex, according to a former adviser.  Jason Miller, who was Trump’s senior communications adviser, made the comments during a Wednesday interview on Steve Bannon’s \"War Room\" podcast.     \\n Former U.S. President Donald Trump and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.\\xa0\\n (Getty Images)  \"She’s no good… I said it and now everybody is seeing it,\" Miller said, recounting the former commander-in-chief’s comments. Miller said Trump feared publicly saying anything negative about Markle could get you \"canceled\" like Morgan, who made headlines on Tuesday after he stormed off the set out of \"Good Morning Britain\" following a tense exchange with co-host Alex Beresford over the Winfrey interview.  Morgan later claimed he was fired over his refusal to apologize for saying that Markle’s claims about suicidal thoughts and racism within the royal family were exaggerated – statements that drew more than 41,000 complaints to U.K. regulator Ofcom, including from Markle herself.  Trump reportedly told Miller, \"I’m on team Piers.\"  \"Piers Morgan is the best, he’s the greatest, and they went and tried to cancel him simply because he criticized Meghan Markle,\" Miller said Trump told him.

The launching of the investigation was revealed in a letter from District Attorney Fani Willis to state officials asking them to preserve any documents potentially related to the 2020 general election, \"with particular care given to set aside and preserve those that may be evidence of attempts to influence the actions of persons who were administering\" it, which would include Trump\\'s Jan. 2 phone call with the secretary. The letter was first reported by the New York Times and obtained by ABC News. \"This investigation includes, but is not limited to, potential violations of Georgia law prohibiting the solicitation of election fraud, the making of false statements to state and local governmental bodies, conspiracy, racketeering, violation of oath of office and any involvement in violence or threats related to the election\\'s administration,\" Willis writes in the letter. News of Willis\\' investigation comes just two days after it was revealed that the Georgia secretary of state\\'s office had launched its own investigation into Trump\\'s phone calls to state officials, and in the midst of the U.S. Senate\\'s ongoing impeachment trial as Democrats seek to convict Trump on charges that his efforts to thwart his election loss helped to incite the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.     In this Aug. 24, 2016, file photo, Fulton County Deputy District Attorney Fani Willis makes her closing arguments during a trial in Atlanta. John Bazemore/AP, FILE     \"The timing here is not accidental given today\\'s impeachment trial,\" said Trump senior adviser Jason Miller in response to the probe. \"This is simply the Democrats\\' latest attempt to score political points by continuing their witch hunt against President Trump, and everybody sees through it.\" A spokesperson for Willis\\' office did not immediately respond to ABC News\\' request for comment. A spokesperson for Raffensperger\\'s office also declined to comment on the development. Willis\\' letter specifically notes that her office currently has \"no reason to believe that any Georgia official is a target of this investigation.\" Trump\\'s first known call to Georgia state election officials took place in December as the state was conducting a signature match audit in Cobb County, outside Atlanta. According to a recording of the call, Trump insisted to a chief investigator in Raffensperger\\'s office that “something bad happened” in the state, telling the official, “When the right answer comes out, you\\'ll be praised.\" Later, when ABC News obtained audio of his hour-long Jan. 2 call to Raffensperger in which Trump pleaded with him to find the exact amount of votes needed to overturn his election loss, election law experts argued Trump could have violated as many as three separate state laws. Trump has previously denied any wrongdoing, and his impeachment lawyers filed a brief last week disputing that Trump \"acted improperly in that telephone call in any way.\"  Editor\\'s note: A previous version of this story stated that during a December call, former President Donald Trump told a Georgia elections investigator to \"find the fraud\" while a signature match audit was underway in one county, according to an individual familiar with the matter. ABC News has since obtained a recording of the call, and Trump did not say those exact words. This story has been updated to remove those quotes.     Dr. Harold Bornstein, the long-haired New York City physician who once said Donald Trump would be the “healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,” died Friday at age 73. His death was listed in a paid obituary Thursday in The New York Times and did not specify a cause.  “Dr. Bornstein was a force of nature who brought joy to his family, friends and everyone he encountered in life, and continues to do so in memory. He loved his wife, Melissa,” the obituary read.      Dr. Harold Bornstein counted President Trump among his patients for more than 35 years until he gave an interview to the Times disclosing that the president took Propecia, a medication that stimulates hair growth.   New York Daily News Archive via Getty Images    After graduating from Tufts Medical School in 1975, Bornstein went into practice with his father on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. He also worked at the nearby Lenox Hill Hospital. Bornstein counted President Trump, 74, among his patients for more than 35 years until he gave an interview to the Times disclosing that the president took Propecia, a medication that stimulates hair growth.  “He has all his hair,” Bornstein said at the time, explaining that he also takes the drug himself. “I have all my hair,” he added.  In the same interview, Bornstein said Trump also took a drug to control rosacea, another to lower his cholesterol and a daily baby aspirin to reduce the risk of heart attack. Two days afterward, Bornstein later alleged, three men including a Trump bodyguard strong-armed their way into the doctor’s office to seize the president’s medical records. In an interview with NBC News, Bornstein called the incident a “raid” and said that it made him feel “raped, frightened and sad.” Then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the seizure, which occurred shortly after Trump took office, was “standard procedure” for an incoming president.  During the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, Bornstein had grabbed headlines for releasing a brief medical report that appeared to be written in the hyperbolic style favored by Trump. The letter stated that Trump’s health was “astonishingly excellent” and his stamina was “extraordinary.” “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,” Bornstein’s letter said. He subsequently explained that he had written the note in just five minutes.  After Trump’s victory, Bornstein gave an interview to STAT News, a medical news site, revealing a bizarrely casual attitude toward the health of the president of the United States.  “If something happens to him, then it happens to him,” Bornstein told STAT. “It’s like all the rest of us, no? That’s why we have a vice president and a speaker of the House and a whole line of people. They can just keep dying.”  Trump had drawn attention to his own health by repeatedly accusing opponent Hillary Clinton of being in poor health ― a conspiracy theory that was fueled by tabloid media aligned with Trump.  He went on to become the oldest person ever sworn in to the Oval Office.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\\n\\n  \\n \\n CNN\\n \\xa0—\\xa0\\n \\n\\n \\n Former President Donald Trump hates not being heard. Being kicked off Twitter after the Jan. 6 insurrection was almost worse for him than losing the election. If we know anything about Trump, it’s that he thirsts to be in the center of the action. \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Trump is trying to start his own social media platform, according to senior adviser Jason Miller, who told Fox News that something would be coming in two or three months. It “will be the hottest ticket in social media,” Miller said. “It’s going to completely redefine the game.” \\n \\n \\n After having a taste of what a quieter Washington looks like with President Joe Biden’s reluctance to put himself out front too much, the announcement of a Trump platform might cause some consternation. If Americans have become comfortable with a political discourse absent of toxic name-calling and reactionary rhetoric, watch out: it might be returning to a social media platform near you very soon. \\n \\n \\n What effect would it have? As a business venture, many observers are skeptical. Writing for Politico, veteran media watcher Jack Shafer predicts that the platform might go the way of Trump Steaks. “Trump’s political potency depends on convening an audience of not just Trumpies,” Shafer writes, “but other conservatives and a good number of liberals who feel a need to monitor them. You can’t own the libs if the libs aren’t listening.”\\n \\n \\n \\n Besides the economics, there is the question of whether this kind of platform would allow Trump to reemerge as a powerful force in national politics. More than 70 million voters backed him in his losing reelection bid; there clearly are many Americans who want to hear what he has to say.\\n \\n \\n But it won’t be easy for him to regain his hold. After all, the former president is now officially a political loser. Even with his fabricated claims of a fraudulent election, the bottom line for many Republicans is that Trump couldn’t pull off a victory against Biden. And in politics this matters. His political capital instantly diminishes once the party’s powerbrokers and voters have seen his vulnerabilities exposed. With other politicians lining up to be the new and improved Trumpian Republican, the idea of a re-rerun for Trump himself will be less appealing. \\n \\n \\n Without presidential power behind him, as Shafer correctly points out, his opponents don’t have to listen. The key to his social media strategy was always to incite and provoke. Trump understood how the world of modern communications worked, and almost every time that he uttered a statement, his goal was to make people angry so that they would respond to what he had to say. All of a sudden, the national conversation changed. \\n \\n \\n \\n Now that Trump is no longer president, his opponents have less incentive to follow his lead. Moreover, someone else commands the power of the bully pulpit, through which Democrats have a strong hand to shape the national conversation and to push our collective focus away from what is happening on some new platform.\\n \\n \\n In other words, Trump’s opponents now have tools that are capable of constraining and limiting his reach. To be sure, Democrats can’t take him lightly or assume that he will simply fade away if nobody is paying attention. They have much more opportunity, however, to actively work on making sure that Trump is no longer the loudest mouth in the room. \\n \\n \\n The media should also be sobered, now that they understand how Trump operates. Too often, news organizations were burned by giving space to everything that the former president had to say. He understood that by stirring controversy with outrageous tweets, the media would end up talking about him and his obsessions rather than other issues.\\n \\n \\n \\n If reporters have learned the lessons of his presidency, they won’t take the bait. As we get closer to a potential end of the pandemic, and huge issues loom at the national level—such as a major infrastructure plan coming from the administration and a battle over voting rights—there is no need to react to the feed from whatever Trump’s version of Twitter might look like—if it materializes. And if the media doesn’t amplify his remarks, Trump’s reach will be small. The power of Trump’s tweets always depended on the “mainstream” media covering what he had to say. \\n \\n \\n Part of the answer will rest with everyone else. Did Democrats and the media, and #NeverTrump Republicans learn the lessons of his presidency? If they understand that Trump’s only genuine ability to reach mass audiences is through playing to anger and if they refuse to let that divert them, this venture is unlikely to have significant impact. \\n \\n  \\n\\t\\nThe fragile alliance between former President Trump and the GOP campaign organizations showed signs of fraying this week amid turf disputes over fundraising and the use of Trump’s name and image in advertising.\\nTrump over the past week has taken legal action and issued public calls to try\\xa0to\\xa0redirect campaign donations from the committees charged with electing Republicans to his own\\xa0campaign bank account.\\nAnd he’s vowed to oust GOP lawmakers who supported his impeachment, including Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), one of the Senate’s foremost centrists who’s up for reelection in next year’s midterms, even as nearly half a dozen other Republican Senate institutionalists are headed for the exits.\\nAt the same time, Trump strategized this week with National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Chairman Rick Scott (R-Fla.) at his private Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. He also offered full-throated endorsements for nearly half a dozen Republicans up for reelection in the Senate, potentially helping them steer clear of primary challengers.\\nTrump has said he’s committed to helping Republicans regain majorities in the House and Senate, even if his actions have appeared at times to work against that goal.\\nRepublicans say it will be a delicate dance with the mercurial former president as the 2022 election cycle heats up, an acknowledgment that the party will need the enthusiasm and loyalty Trump engenders among base voters as\\xa0the GOP\\xa0seeks to take back control of Congress.\\n“Trump is going to do what he wants to do, and he’s going to involve himself in primaries, and it’s a wasted effort to try and convince him otherwise,” said one Republican National Committee (RNC) insider. “Trump has all the cards here. He’s got the popular support, and he’s got the support of most major donors. So yes, it’d be nice if we could all get along and fly together, but there are some folks in the House and Senate who he has a right to go after. He’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but he’s done more for the Republican Party than anyone alive, and he deserves respect.”\\nA Senate campaign source said Scott, a Florida senator with presidential ambitions, was at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday night updating Trump on the NRSC’s plans for the cycle and how\\xa0it can work with him to win back the majority.\\nA Trump World source said they discussed endorsements for some incumbents as well candidate recruitment for several open seats. Trump has already publicly endorsed GOP Sens. John Boozman (Ark.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), John Kennedy (La.), Tim Scott (S.C.) and Jerry Moran (Kansas), although none of them were expected to pull serious primary challengers.\\nHowever, the Team Trump source said the former president refused to back down from his promise to travel to Alaska to campaign against Murkowski, the only GOP senator up for reelection in 2022 who voted to convict him in his second impeachment trial.\\nAlso looming over 2022:\\xa0Trump’s soured relationship with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a top party fundraiser.\\n“There is tension, especially with some of the incumbents in the House and Senate who backed impeachment, so the GOP committee chairs will have to decide whether they’re sticking by the incumbents or standing with Trump,” said one former Trump administration official. “If push comes to shove, I expect they’ll side with the president. That’s just the reality of where the party is at.”\\nIn the House, Trump has endorsed former White House aide Max Miller, who is challenging Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (Ohio), one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach.\\nTrump adviser Jason Miller warned Friday that there will be severe consequences if the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) or any other outside group intervenes to oppose Trump’s sanctioned candidates.\\n“If the NRCC or the committee were to come in really strong to attack Max … number one, that’s going to get President Trump involved in a huge way,” Miller said on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast. “But I think it’s probably safe to say that any cooperation or working with such an entity in the future is probably done.”\\n“If President Trump endorses someone\\xa0…\\xa0when the committee starts attacking them, there are going to be big problems,” he added.\\nTrump has good relationships with the heads of the GOP campaign committees: RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, the NRSC’s Scott and NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer (R-Minn.).\\nHowever, Trump raised questions about his ability to cooperate with GOP leaders this week when he sent a cease-and-desist order to the three groups saying they cannot fundraise off his name or likeness without explicit permission.\\nThe RNC responded with a respectful letter saying it “has every right to refer to public figures as it engages in core, First Amendment-protected political speech, and it will continue to do so in pursuit of these common goals.”\\nTrump followed up with a clarifying statement saying that he fully supports the Republican Party and the “important” GOP committees but that he does not want any of the money he helps raise to be directed toward the “RINOs and fools” who have criticized him.\\n“So much money is being raised and completely wasted by people that do not have the GOP’s best interests in mind. If you donate to our Save America PAC at DonaldJTrump.com, you are helping the America First movement and doing it right. We will WIN, and we will WIN BIG! Our Country is being destroyed by the Democrats!” Trump said.\\n That back-and-forth appears to have leveled off for now, with the committees under the impression that Trump will sanction their fundraising efforts so long as it does not benefit the GOP rebels who voted to impeach him.\\nThe RNC will hold part of its spring donors retreat next month at Mar-a-Lago, where Trump is expected to speak. The RNC has used Trump’s name to fundraise for that event, which is expected to draw several potential White House hopefuls eager to take up Trump’s mantle, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\\nOf course, Trump is leaving open the possibility that he could run again in 2024, and he’ll be the prohibitive front-runner if he does.\\n“The RNC and President Trump are focused on the same goal — retaking our Congressional majorities in 2022,” said RNC national press secretary Mandi Merritt. “There is much more that unites our Party than divides it, and together we will work to expose Democrats’ bad policies and elect Republicans up and down the ballot.”\\xa0\\xa0\\n  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump continues to insist the United States has a trade deficit with Canada, following news reports that he claimed at a fundraiser that he talked trade with the country’s prime minister without knowing all the facts. Trump says on Twitter Thursday: “We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that’s how I know!” Trump, who routinely inflates trade deficits, has previously complained about a trade deficit with Canada even though the U.S. runs an overall surplus with that country — when the value of services is included in the calculation. Trump spoke about trade during a fundraising speech in St. Louis on Wednesday, according to audio obtained by The Washington Post. The paper reports that Trump said he freestyled with the facts when talking trade with Trudeau. Trump said Trudeau told him there was no trade deficit. Trump said he replied, ”‘Wrong, Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’” Trump claimed the figures don’t include timber and energy. Canadian Foreign Affairs spokesman Adam Austin said in an emailed statement that the countries “have a balanced and mutually beneficial trading relationship.” He added: “According to their own statistics, the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Canada.” The Office of the United States Trade Representative says the U.S. has a trade surplus with Canada. ___ Associated Press writer Rob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report. ___ Information from: The Washington Post, http://www.washingtonpost.com    \\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t \\n\\t\\n   Former President Donald Trump is urging his followers to get vaccinated while also hinting he’s mulling a 2024 run — especially if Royal-rebuking Meghan Markle jumps in the race.\\nThe former president didn’t hesitate when asked on Fox News Tuesday night if he would recommend everyone line up for a shot to guard against the coronavirus.\\n“I would recommend it. I would recommend it to a lot of people who don’t want to get it and a lot of those people voted for me, frankly,” Trump said. “It’s a great vaccine, it’s a safe vaccine and it’s something that works.”\\nHe didn’t specify which vaccine — Moderna’s and Pfizer’s mRNA technology or the Johnson & Johnson traditional dose — but he did say his Warp Speed program that cleared the way for rapid production of the vaccines will ultimately “save” the country and “frankly, save the world.”\\t\\nDr. Anthony Fauci this weekend called on Trump to use his popularity to persuade more Republicans to get vaccinated. The nation is averaging 2.5 million daily shots with more supply in the pipeline.\\n“It seems absolutely inevitable that the vast majority of people who are his close followers would listen to him,” Fauci told “Fox News Sunday.”\\n“Fox News Primetime” host Maria Bartiromo pulled that support for vaccinations out of Trump during a fast-paced telephone interview where he hit President Biden over the crisis at the southern border and rising gas prices he said will jump by “one dollar, two dollars, three dollars.”\\nTrump also said that he took a big “risk” on vaccines but it has paid off. As for anti-vaxxers, Trump added “we have our freedoms and we have to live by that.”\\nBiden said on ABC News Tuesday night that his message to migrants at the border is “Don’t come over.” When pressed, he added: “Yes, I can say quite clearly: Don’t come over. Don’t leave your town or city or community.”\\t\\nTrump said his approach of using Mexico to guard their borders before migrants reached the U.S. was working.\\n“We also made a tremendous dent in human trafficking … and drugs,” he said.\\nHe accused the Biden administration of allowing “hundreds of thousands” of immigrants to flood into Texas and other border crossings.\\nAs for his possible Oval Office reboot, Trump said he’d “take a look and see.” He cited polls that show he’s still the top choice among Republicans, but it’s still too early to tell. He is aiming to “take back the House” first in the mid-terms.\\nBut if Markle runs, as some are speculating off her recent Oprah Winfrey interview calling out the Royal family, he’s more likely to jump in, he added.\\n“I hope that happens … I’d have an even stronger feeling toward running,” he said.\\nHe quickly added he’s a fan of the queen and he didn’t like Markle’s criticisms — which included alleged racist remarks about her child’s skin color.\\n\\t\\n\\t  \\n\\t\\n\\tJoe Dwinell is the Herald\\'s Executive Editor and investigative/enterprise reporter.

The call added to the examples of Trump\\'s extraordinary efforts to push false claims of widespread voter fraud and influence Georgia election officials as they certified the state\\'s election results.\\n \\n The audio file of the December 23 call between the former President and investigator Frances Watson was discovered as the Georgia Secretary of State\\'s Office responded to a public records request. The personal familiar spoke with CNN on the condition of anonymity to describe the internal process. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n The Washington Post first reported the details of how the audio of the December phone call emerged. \\n \\n \\n \\n Watson declined comment to CNN through the Georgia Secretary of State\\'s press secretary.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  CNN previously reported that in the December phone call to the Georgia Secretary of State\\'s Office, Trump urged their top investigator, Watson, to find fraud in the 2020 presidential election, telling her that she would be a \"praised\" for overturning results in favor of President Joe Biden.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis had sent a round of letters to Georgia state officials in February, including the Georgia Secretary of State\\'s Office, asking them to preserve documents relevant to election interference. Willis is currently conducting a criminal investigation into Trump\\'s attempts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia.\\n \\n \\n \\n The secretary of state\\'s office is also separately investigating Trump for his attempts to overturn the state\\'s election results. \\n \\n Audio of an hour-long January 2 phone call in which Trump repeatedly pressured Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \"find\" the exact number of votes needed to overturn Biden\\'s victory surfaced soon after the call happened. But the December call only became public last week. \\n \\n Watson told CNN affiliate WSB-TV\\'s investigative reporter Mark Winne that she had recorded the December call from Trump for posterity. \\n \\n \"It\\'s not every day, that probably will never happen again in my lifetime,\" Watson told WSB. \\n \\n It is still not clear why Watson moved the audio of the call to her trash folder, but Watson told Winne that even though she was surprised Trump called her, she did not perceive any pressure from his phone call. \\n \\n \"It is something that is not expected, as I mentioned in the call you know I was shocked that he would take the time to do that,\" Watson said.\\n \\n Trump in the December call had encouraged Watson to look to uncover \"dishonesty\" in her signature checks for absentee ballots in Fulton County, the most populous county in state and the one that houses most of Atlanta.\\n \\n \\n \\n \"But if you go back two years, and if you can get to Fulton, you are going to find things that are going to be unbelievable,\" the former President said. \"The dishonesty that we\\'ve heard from. But Fulton is the mother lode.\" \\n \\n \\n Later on the phone call, Trump told Watson that he hoped \"we\" could win Georgia and that \"you have the most important job in the country right now.\" \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n Former President Donald Trump wants to play a role in leading the Republican Party to victory in future elections, but it’s becoming clear that he means to provide his help only to those who’ve never crossed him. This month, that meant sending a warning shot to three national Republican campaign entities devoted to defending incumbents — the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee — including those who voted to impeach or convict Trump. Trump’s legal team demanded in letters, first reported by Politico, that the bodies must stop using the Trump name and likeness in fundraising.  “Not only is President Trump the biggest name and the biggest draw in Republican politics, he’s the biggest name and the biggest draw in politics overall,” says Jason Miller, senior advisor to Trump. He says Trump is willing to help, but he wants to be asked first. “President Trump will continue to be the kingmaker in the Republican party.”  Trump is famously protective of his name brand, but having the symbolic figurehead of the GOP undermine party efforts puts his fellow Republicans in a difficult spot. One Republican lawmaker, who spoke on background because they don’t “do hallway interviews,” noted the situation was “obviously not ideal.” The 2022 midterm elections are more than a year and a half away, but Trump’s apparent ambivalence over helping GOP lawmakers is raising the question now of what his role will be as the party tries to win back the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. Republican lawmakers largely stood by Trump through two impeachments and countless scandals. But after some distanced themselves after Trump sought to overturn the 2020 election results and incited a violent mob that stormed the Capitol, he has lashed out at the GOP establishment.  On Thursday, Florida Sen. Rick Scott, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, returned home to Florida, where he met Trump for dinner at Mar-a-Lago to discuss how the former President can help Republicans regain control of the Senate. “He said he wants to help make sure we get a majority, so we’re going to work hard and make sure it happens,” Scott told TIME earlier that afternoon, saying he had plans to meet with the former President soon. According to Miller, part of the meeting was spent discussing how Trump can help recruit “America First” conservative candidates, and going through areas where they saw overlapping interests. The cease-and-desist letters weren’t the only sign of resistance from Trump world over helping fellow Republicans. Days after they were sent, the Trump-aligned Save America PAC issued a fundraising email to his supporters, asking them to send donations directly to that political action committee. “No more money for RINOS,” Trump said in the included March 8 statement, using the acronym for ‘Republican in Name Only.’ “They do nothing but hurt the Republican Party and our great voting base—they will never lead us to Greatness.” The next day, Trump appeared to reverse course and put out a statement vouching for the party entities. “I fully support the Republican Party and important GOP Committees, but I do not support RINOs and fools, and it is not their right to use my likeness or image to raise funds. So much money is being raised and completely wasted by people that do not have the GOP’s best interests in mind,” Trump said. The statement went on once again to encourage his supporters to donate directly to political efforts that he’s guiding, rather than the broader Republican Party. The Republican campaign bodies have shown no signs of heeding Trump’s legal team’s request. On March 8, Justin Riemer, chief counsel to the RNC, sent a letter to Trump’s lawyer Alex Cannon in response to the cease-and-desist letter. Riemer noted the close relationship between Trump and RNC chair Ronna McDaniel. “We understand that President Trump reaffirmed to her over the weekend that he approves of the RNC’s current use of his name in fundraising and other materials, including for our upcoming donor retreat event at Palm Beach at which we look forward to him participating.”  Riemer went on to say that the RNC “of course” has the right to refer to public figures and “will continue to do so,” highlighting Trump and the RNC’s “common goals.”  Publicly, the bodies have taken a more conciliatory tone. “The RNC, NRSC and NRCC are grateful for President Trump’s support, both past and future,” said Scott, McDaniel, and NRCC chair Rep. Tom Emmer in a joint statement on March 9. “Together, we look forward to working with President Trump to retake our Congressional majorities and deliver results for the American people.”  Around Capitol Hill, Republicans were careful not to express any sort of frustration around the former President’s reservations in sharing the wealth with his colleagues. Some of Trump’s most ardent allies in Congress, like Rep. Matt Gaetz, told TIME that Trump was being reasonable in his request. “Ultimately President Trump is going to decide what kind of role he wants to play in elections in the future,” said Republican Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, when asked about the letters at a March 9 press conference. “I know we’re focused on winning the House back.”  Scott, when asked if he was worried whether Trump might leave Republican Senators out to dry in terms of campaigning the next couple of years, suggested it wasn’t a concern. “Everybody’s working hard … we’re going to end up with good candidates, and so we’ll be fine.” In the last six years, Trump single handedly reshaped GOP politics, creating a bitterly divided party that appears to be heading in two different directions: those who would prefer to distance themselves from the 45th President, and those who want to continue embracing his politics. Though most of the party remains loyal to him, Trump has never fully embraced them back, observers say. “It’s always been about him,” says a Republican operative, who spoke on background due to current employment, noting the letters he sent did not come as a surprise. “He’s not interested in the party, never has been.”  At the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February, Trump insisted that he didn’t want to start a new party, saying that the current Republican party would unite and be “stronger than ever before.”  Exactly how helpful he plans to be in those efforts remains an open question. Miller insists helping win back the chambers of Congress is a priority for Trump, and many rank-and-file Republicans want that backing. As U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, a fierce Trump loyalist, put it: “It’s impossible for us to succeed without President Trump.”  Write to Lissandra Villa at lissandra.villa@time.com. \\n   Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance announced Friday that he will not run for re-election—but it sure sounds like he’s trying his hardest to ensure his last months in office come to a dramatic climax as he weighs up whether to charge a case against former President Donald Trump. In a piece for The New Yorker , investigative journalist Jane Mayer reports that Vance’s office has dramatically accelerated the investigation into Trump’s business dealings in recent weeks—particularly since it got its hands on Trump’s tax records at the end of a long legal battle last month. As one person said to be closely involved in the investigation told The New Yorker: “They mean business now... It hit me—they’re closer.” One interesting new detail from the probe comes from Jennifer Weisselberg—the former daughter-in-law of Allen Weisselberg, chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. Allen Weisselberg has reportedly been identified by prosecutors as the most likely candidate to flip against Trump and spill all the gory details of his business dealings. And, by the sounds of it, his former daughter-in-law has already picked her side. In her first substantial public comments on the case, Jennifer Weisselberg confirmed that she’s spoken to investigators about ex-husband Barry Weisselberg’s time managing the Trump-operated ice-skating rink and carousel in Central Park. Specifically, Jennifer Weisselberg said that investigators have asked about the seven rent-free years they spent in a Trump-owned apartment overlooking Central Park. “Only a small part of your salary is reported,” she said. “They pay you with apartments and other stuff, as a control tactic, so you can’t leave. They own you! You have to do whatever corrupt crap they ask.” If this alleged gift wasn’t declared in tax forms, prosecutors could use it against the couple—and as leverage to tempt Allen Weisselberg into cooperating.  Allen Weisselberg Is the Trump Exec Who Could Take Down the Donald  However, Jennifer Weisselberg thinks it’s unlikely her ex-father-in-law will play ball, saying: “He has more feelings and adoration for Donald than for his wife... For Donald, it’s a business. But for Allen, it’s a love affair.” As an example, she recalled to Mayer being hit on by Trump in front of her then father-in-law—at a shivah for Allen’s deceased mother—and said with incredulity: “He didn’t stand up for me!” Jennifer Weisselberg also said that, at the same event to mourn the dead, Trump showed people photographs of naked women with him on a yacht. Separately, Mayer also reported the first details of the whereabouts of Trump’s tax documents after they were provided to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office in February. The hard drive is believed to be in an incredibly high-security chamber within the Louis J. Lefkowitz State Office Building. The chamber is reported to be sealed by bank-vault-style doors, and lined with copper foil to stop remote tampering attempts. Meanwhile, CNN reported Friday that Trump’s time in the White House has given New York prosecutors a possible boost for any case against Trump. Prosecutors have reportedly discussed using a section of New York criminal procedure that allows for the extension of the statute of limitations if a defendant has been out of state “continuously,” as Trump has been since he took office in 2017. According to CNN, prosecutors think that could afford them more time to investigate Trump’s business dealings.  House Intel Will Call Trump Org Moneyman Allen Weisselberg to Testify  However, while the investigation is heating up, there is clearly still a lot of work to do before Vance departs office in nine months—and there’s still a possibility that the investigation will be closed with no charges. Preet Bharara, the former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, told The New Yorker, “All the signals indicate that there’s a belief on the part of that office that there’s a good chance of a charge... [But] no one should be under the illusion that this is easy or a slam-dunk case.”  Read more at The Daily Beast.   Get our top stories in your inbox every day. Sign up now!

Former President Donald Trump speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Sunday, Feb. 28, 2021, in Orlando, Fla. (AP Photo/John Raoux)      Alabama Republican Party leaders have declared former President Donald Trump “one of the greatest presidents of all time.” A framed copy of the declaration will be given to Trump soon in Florida. The state Republican Party Executive Committee unanimously voted for the proclamation Feb. 27 at its winter meeting in Montgomery. Former state Rep. Perry Hooper Jr. of Montgomery, one of the resolution’s sponsors, will travel to Mar-A-Largo to deliver a framed copy of the resolution to the former president, reports said. The resolution was submitted by several party executive committee members and says Trump was one of the “most effective Presidents in the 245-year history of this Republic.” It cites Operation Warp Speed for delivering “safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines in record time,” the “largest tax cuts and reforms in American history,” withdrawal from “the job-and-trade-killing Trans-pacific Partnership and NAFTA” and appointing “three constitutional conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court.”   If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.    A recording of former US President Donald Trump urging a state investigator to look for voter fraud in certain countries was recently found in the “trash” of the officer’s computer. Trump had urged Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger office’s lead investigator Frances Watson on December 23 to look for voter fraud in specific counties, reportedly telling her that she would receive praise after the “right answer” is out in public domain. The existence of a recording was first reported by The Washington Post in January, following which The Wall Street Journal published the audio last week. During the emergence of the first report of a recording in January, state officials said no such recording existed.   Officials told The Washington Post that the recording was located on the trash folder of Watson’s device and was found while responding to a request for public records. In the November elections, Trump lost the state of Georgia by almost 12,000 votes but continued to claim that the vote was rigged, and that the election was stolen - without offering any evidence. Trump asked Watson to check signatures on mail-in ballot envelopes and compare them to signatures from two years ago, especially in Fulton County.   Trump allegedly\\xa0intended to inflate the number of non-matching signatures in an area led by Democrats. In 2018, many ballots in Georgia and Florida were rejected when officials matched signatures and found that the signatures of the voters had evolved. Watson reportedly told Trump that she was “honoured” but also “shocked” at him taking the time to do it. Trump’s supporters defend his actions by saying that the former president was simply attempting to check in on legitimate concerns of voter fraud - which have never been proven.   The Washington Post has corrected a story on Donald Trump to say he never told a Georgia elections investigator in December to “find the fraud” with regards to the presidential election. The lengthy correction stated, “Two months after publication of this story, the Georgia secretary of state released an audio recording of President Donald Trump’s December phone call with the state’s top elections investigator. The recording revealed that The Post misquoted Trump’s comments on the call, based on information provided by a source.” It continued, “Trump did not tell the investigator to ‘find the fraud’ or say she would be ‘a national hero’ if she did so. Instead, Trump urged the investigator to scrutinize ballots in Fulton County, Ga., asserting she would find ‘dishonesty’ there. He also told her that she had ‘the most important job in the country right now’ … The headline and text of this story have been corrected to remove quotes misattributed to Trump.”  Also Read: Washington Post Aims to Get Employees Back Into Office in July  The Jan. 9 story can still be found at its original URL and is now dated March 11 to account for the correction. The story itself cited “an individual briefed on the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the conversation.” The Post also withheld the name of the investigator at the time “because of the risk of threats and harassment directed at election officials.” This is not to be confused with the Post’s audio recording from Jan. 3 of Trump urging Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger to “find” enough votes to help him overturn the election he lost to President Joe Biden. Read original story Washington Post Now Says Trump Never Told Georgia Official to ‘Find the Fraud’ At TheWrap   The former coronavirus response coordinator in the Trump White House, Dr. Deborah Birx, says she still thinks about the moment last year when she sat silently while former President Donald Trump raised the possibility of injecting disinfectant into people to treat COVID-19. \"Frankly, I didn\\'t know how to handle that episode,\" Birx said Monday in an interview with ABC News\\' Terry Moran for ABC News Live\\'s \"The Breakdown.\" \"I still think about it every day.\" While Trump was mocked and condemned for suggesting such a dangerous idea, and his comments became symbolic of his response to the pandemic, Birx also was criticized for not speaking up more forcefully in the moment. She said Monday her nearly three decades of military service had kicked in then, and that she only spoke briefly to say \"not a treatment\" when Trump asked her if ultraviolet rays and heat could be used to treat the coronavirus in people. \"You can see how extraordinarily uncomfortable I was,\" Birx said, noting that at the time Trump had been speaking to a different official in the room. \"Those of you who have served in the military know that there are discussions you have in private with your commanding officers and there\\'s discussions you had in public.\"     Dr. Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, listens as President Donald Trump speaks with members of the coronavirus task force during a briefing in th... Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images     Birx was a prominent figure at Trump\\'s briefings on the virus, at which he often downplayed the pandemic\\'s seriousness, with her and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government\\'s top infectious disease expert. They often played the delicate role of scientific counterweights to the president\\'s lies and misinformation, although as a political appointee -- unlike Fauci -- Birx could be fired by the president at any time. Birx said she and Fauci talked \"all the time\" about \"how to correct the record.\" \"I can\\'t tell you how many discussions we had on, how do we get the message out realizing what\\'s happening at the most senior levels of the White House,\" Birx said. Birx said in December she was stepping down from her White House role, and while her colleagues had told ABC News that she had been willing to work with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris\\'s administration, she did not stay on.     President Donald Trump looks on as White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx speaks about the coronavirus outbreak in the press briefing room... Drew Angerer/Getty Images     Birx praised Biden officials\\' consistent and scientifically sound messaging -- a marked change from the Trump administration, where key public health officials like the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were often sidelined. \"Whether it\\'s the CDC director or Dr. Fauci or President Biden or Vice President Harris, all of them and all of their spokespeople are communicating exactly the same pieces,\" she said, \"and I think that is critically important.\" Differing messages, she said, allow people \"to give themselves permission to perhaps do things that may put other people at risk.\" Birx applauded the former presidents -- except for Trump -- who have promoted vaccinations. \"I hope President Trump lends his voice to that. I think it is important. But to every Trump supporter out there: Protect yourself, protect your family. Get vaccinated.\" Since leaving the White House, Birx has taken on several roles in the private sector: senior fellow at the Bush Institute research center; a member of the board of directors of the pharmaceutical company Innoviva; and chief medical and scientific adviser for ActivePure Technologies, a Dallas-based air filtration company.

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images     She said ActivePure, which develops air purification technology for indoor spaces, could help people get back indoors in a way that is safe. \"While I was out across the country listening to communities, the number one thing that everyone asked me was when will we get back to normal,\" Birx said. ActivePure sells products used against other pathogens in the air, and is in the process of applying for Food and Drug Administration approval of its technology to fight the novel coronavirus, as well. \"It\\'s about COVID-19 now, but I think it\\'s going to be about aerosolized and respiratory viruses in the future,\" Birx said. \"I think we\\'ll all look at our indoor space in a much more critical way.\"        The chief operating officer of a small Chicago hospital resigned on Wednesday after reports that he used coronavirus vaccines meant for low-income residents to vaccinate employees at his luxury wristwatch dealer, his regular steakhouse and his condo building — which is former president Donald Trump’s Chicago tower. The resignation of Anosh Ahmed was announced late Wednesday by Loretto Hospital, a hospital serving a majority-Black neighborhood on Chicago’s West Side.  Ahmed’s actions — reported over the past week by the news site Block Club Chicago — had raised concerns that Loretto executives were putting their friends ahead of their patients. The city of Chicago had already cut off Loretto’s supply of new vaccines while it investigated. “On behalf of the Board of Trustees, I want to thank Dr. Ahmed for his contributions to the Loretto Hospital community and we wish him the best in his future endeavors,” Edward M. Hogan, chairman of Loretto’s board of trustees, said in a written statement. Ahmed declined to comment to The Washington Post. On March 10 and 11, Loretto vaccinated 72 employees at Trump’s downtown hotel and condo tower, where Ahmed had bought a $2.7 million 43rd-floor condo five months earlier. Under city guidelines, hotel workers were not supposed to be vaccinated until three weeks later. In addition, the hospital offered vaccines to county judges and congregants at Loretto Hospital CEO George Miller’s church. A hospital spokeswoman said only eligible congregants were given vaccines. On Monday, Block Club Chicago reported that Loretto also offered vaccines to employees at a luxury watch store where Ahmed was a regular customer. The watch shop is in Chicago’s luxe “Gold Coast” shopping district, about 10 miles away from the neighborhood that Loretto serves. Block Club Chicago said that watch store employees were vaccinated March 3, a week before the event at Trump’s Chicago tower. After that report, the hospital’s board met but decided not to terminate Ahmed. Then, on Wednesday, came the latest report: that Ahmed had arranged for vaccinations at Maple and Ash, a downtown steakhouse he frequents. The menu shows that some steaks cost up to $180 each. Loretto Hospital did not respond to questions about that report, but hours later it announced it had accepted Ahmed’s resignation. Asked whether the hospital had confirmed that Ahmed arranged for vaccines for the steakhouse and watch store staff, spokesman Becky Carroll said, “That is part of the internal review being conducted by the board.” Attempts to reach executives at the steakhouse on Wednesday evening were unsuccessful. Last week, Chicago said it would cut off Loretto’s supply of new coronavirus vaccines while the city looked into the hospital’s practices. On Monday, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) said the hospital would remain excluded for now: “I don’t expect them to be coming back any time soon.’ “I fear that we’re going to hear more stories. Which is why we pushed pause on giving Loretto new first doses,” Lightfoot said in a news conference Monday. ‘They’ve got work to do, I think, to rebuild trust in their own community.” Chicago is still in “Phase 1b” of its vaccination plan, which began in late January. In that stage, the vaccine is supposed to be given to those over 65, people in prisons and homeless shelters, teachers and grocery-store workers. Last week, Block Club Chicago also reported that Ahmed had bragged that he had also vaccinated Eric Trump, the former president’s son. Later, the hospital issued a statement from Ahmed saying that he had only been joking. Eric Trump has not responded to requests for comment.   You might think of folklore as a world of fictional characters from old stories and Disney cartoons, but in American folklore one finds legendary characters grounded in real people. Historical folk figures from Johnny Appleseed to Daniel Boone, and from Babe Ruth to Elvis Presley, are known to Americans as much by apocryphal stories as by their actual deeds. Will Donald Trump join this pantheon? After the ransacking of the Capitol, Trump left the White House and was exiled by Twitter with a sigh of good riddance from\\xa0many. Yet\\xa0Trump’s “golden” presence and reception at CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Conference, suggest that he will not soon fade away. His future on the American scene taunts both Democrats and Republicans. Democrats perplex over the persistent enthusiasm of Trump supporters. Republicans agonize over a possible run in 2024, or worse, though he says he won\\'t do it, the still possible formation of a Trump-led third party.\\xa0Without a doubt, Trump elicits both abhorrence and affection.\\xa0 And without a doubt, he is a cultural force. Eternal struggles and selfish\\xa0cons The thought of Trump as an American folk hero may distress those eager to consign him to oblivion, but he\\xa0already exhibits some of the credentials necessary for admission into the body of American folklore. To begin with, mythical actions and words attributed to Trump proliferate on the Internet, ranging from claims that he refers to himself as the “second coming of God” and the “chosen one,” to stories that he paid off the mortgage of a passing motorist who fixed a flat tire on Trump’s limo. In folklore, heroes engage in eternal struggles, battle adversaries near and far, evoke fear in foes, and defend their followers against archenemies.\\xa0At different times, Americans have ascribed heroic status to George Washington, Davy Crockett, Robert E. Lee\\xa0and Douglas MacArthur.   To millions, Trump stands as a hero against socialism, immigration, multiculturalism\\xa0and the deep state. When he called for his followers to join him in disrupting the ceremonial presidential election count,\\xa0thousands flocked to the Capitol. And, while progressives may accuse Trump of crimes, his followers dismiss these accusations as persecution. In Trump, they see a hero with glamor, generosity and\\xa0charisma, who sticks it to the “libs.”   Civil war: Anti-Trump Republican senators can fight GOP or help Biden fix America   There are also tricksters in folklore. The trickster is selfish, aggressive, amoral, a con artist\\xa0and huckster. The trickster creates a world of illusion\\xa0that takes in others, creates a corrupt social order, and dupes the gullible into believing the trickster’s promises. Think of American tricksters such as P.T. Barnum, Charles Ponzi (of the scheme that bears his name), and Bernie Madoff. Trump’s amorality, penchant for disruption, promotion of misleading narratives, false promises\\xa0and unwavering selfishness place him squarely in the tradition of the trickster. Believers create the hero But, with Trump there’s a twist. The very behaviors that condemn him as a trickster to progressives are what\\xa0glorify him to conservatives. To his followers, he’s a hero who is also a bad boy. When he flouts norms, tramples boundaries\\xa0and excoriates his opponents by calling them names, his fans and followers respond with approval, “He says what I think,” and with affection, “I love Donald Trump.”\\xa0 The combination of hero and trickster places the former president into a folk role that historian\\xa0Eric Hobsbawm called the social bandit, a trickster who may be an outlaw but is also revered as a champion and perhaps even an avenger.\\xa0Here he shares space with other tricksters who became folk heroes such as\\xa0Jesse James, Al Capone, Bonny and Clyde, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\\xa0Trump appeals to his base precisely because he fulfills both roles — hero\\xa0and\\xa0trickster.\\xa0And, it’s not about the facts.\\xa0His status as a folk hero depends more on what people believe about him than on his actual record.   Mastio & Lawrence: Is Donald Trump a declining parody or a terrifying threat?\\xa0   Most of us think of folklore as tales told around a campfire. But for Trump, his campfire is the Internet. Trump’s deeds are in his words, therefore he is perfect for an era of social media where stories reach millions in minutes and where narratives never die. And even as he is banned and suspended from platforms like Twitter and Facebook, it is through social media that his legend lives and spreads. So\\xa0it should not surprise anyone that millions accept the myths surrounding him. And\\xa0as long as they believe, Trump will speak for them and reign as a larger-than-life American folk hero. After all, it is believers who create the hero.

As president, Donald Trump grew tired of Americans listening to Dr. Anthony Fauci, and Fauci bristled over his treatment by Trump. Now Fauci, working as chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, says Americans need to hear more from Trump — specifically, encouragement to get the coronavirus vaccine. In a round of interviews on the Sunday morning news shows, Fauci lamented polling that shows Trump supporters are more likely to refuse to get vaccinated than most Americans. Politics needs to be separated from \"common-sense, no-brainer\" public health measures, said the government\\'s top infectious disease expert, and it would be a \"game changer\" for the vaccination push if the former president were to use his \"incredible influence\" among Republicans. \"If he [Trump] came out and said, ‘Go and get vaccinated. It’s really important for your health, the health of your family and the health of the country,’ it seems absolutely inevitable that the vast majority of people who are his close followers would listen to him,\" Fauci said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" There was no immediate response from the former president’s office on Sunday. In his only public remarks on the COVID-19 vaccine since leaving the White House, at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 28, Trump briefly said, \"Everybody go get your shot\" — as an aside amid his complaints that Biden and the media aren\\'t giving him due credit for the vaccine. He repeated that grievance in a tweet-style news release last week, claiming dubiously that without him, it would have taken five years longer to develop a vaccine. But he\\'s offered no sustained messaging to promote the vaccination campaign, nor has he shown photos of his own inoculations, as have Biden and four former presidents. At a White House news briefing on Friday, when asked if there had been outreach for Trump to talk to vaccine-skeptical Republicans, press secretary Jen Psaki answered with curbed enthusiasm for the idea. \"We recognize, as a Democratic administration with a Democratic president, that we may not be the most effective messenger to communicate with hard-core supporters of the former president,\" she said. Psaki then added that \"we also know that it is not always famous people who are the most effective messengers,\" suggesting there are nonpartisan voices such as faith leaders who can be called on as vaccine advocates. But Andy Slavitt, a senior White House coronavirus adviser for Biden, said on MSNBC on Sunday that Trump \"ought to be talking to his supporters\" about the vaccine, adding that it\\'s a nonpartisan issue. \"This is an effort, the Republicans should know, [that] began before we got here, and we are carrying it out,\" Slavitt said. Fauci\\'s July 4 forecast Fauci also echoed Biden\\'s cautious optimism on U.S. progress against the coronavirus pandemic. \"If by the time we get to the Fourth of July — with the rollout of the vaccines — we get the level of infection so low, I\\'m not going to be able to tell you exactly what the specific guidelines of the CDC are [then], but I can tell you, for sure, they will be much more liberal than they are right now about what you can do,\" Fauci said. Fauci said Sunday that Americans should look to recent surges and lockdowns in Europe as a reminder to keep taking precautions. For more, see Scott Eidler\\'s story for Newsday. Janison: Biden Cabinet is an upgrade So far at least, Biden\\'s Cabinet is on track to operate without the kind of fiascoes that Trump\\'s first-year lineup produced, writes Newsday\\'s Dan Janison. Ideological differences aside, if conventional experience and credentials count, the appointments look like an upgrade. Attorney General Merrick Garland has been steeped in the judicial system as a federal judge and prosecutor. Jeff Sessions, the first to lead the Justice Department in the last administration, was a key Trump campaign supporter and a longtime Alabama senator. Trump ultimately canned Sessions for following ethics guidance and for recusing himself from the Russia probe. Antony Blinken presents a similar shift as secretary of state. For better or worse, he\\'s steeped in the ways of the pre-Trump State Department. Rex Tillerson, Trump\\'s first secretary of state, came from ExxonMobil; Trump fired him after bitter estrangement. New Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan is tasked with playing a sharply different role from that of Trump\\'s first occupant of the post, who shared the 45th president\\'s denial of climate change. Scott Pruitt resigned as Trump\\'s first EPA administrator amid ethics probes that in part involved coziness with the fossil fuel industry. Trump plays a pinball In his post-presidency, Trump has yet become the formidable political force that his camp had advertised, writes Politico. Republicans, and even some allies, say he is disorganized, torn between playing the role of antagonist and party leader. \"There is no apparatus, no structure — and part of that is due to a lack of political understanding on Trump’s behalf,\" said a person close to the former president. Trump has promised a ruthless settling of scores with a party apparatus that declined to fiercely defend him during his second impeachment. But Trump has maintained close ties to GOP officials who have committed to supporting congressional incumbents who cast votes against him for incitement of the deadly Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol insurrection. One former administration official who has been in contact with Trump described him as a \"pinball,\" noting that his tendency to abruptly change directions or seize on a new idea after speaking with a friend or outside adviser — a habit that often frustrated aides during his time in office — has carried into his post-presidency life. Building toward infrastructure plan House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday pledged swift work by Congress on a job and infrastructure package that will be \"fiscally sound,\" but she said she isn’t sure whether the next major item on Biden’s agenda will attract Republican backing. \"Building roads and bridges and water supply systems and the rest has always been bipartisan … except when they oppose it with a Democratic president, as they did under President Obama, and we had to shrink the package,\" Pelosi said on ABC\\'s \"This Week.\" \"But, nonetheless, hopefully, we will have bipartisanship.\" Wyoming\\'s Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 3 Senate Republican, said on the same show that he wants to see bipartisan support for an infrastructure legislation. But he said the House in the last Congress refused to embrace a $287 billion bill unanimously passed by a Senate committee and changed it to a \"Green New Deal\" that Republicans could not accept. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told the Long Island Association in a Zoom address Friday that an infrastructure bill could fund New York’s lagging Gateway and East Side Access transit projects.

Mnuchin\\'s nest egg for COVID bill costs Biden\\'s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief and stimulus package, signed into law last week, won\\'t cause the federal deficit to balloon by anywhere near that amount, Politico reports. That\\'s because the Treasury has a cash pile of well over $1 trillion, built last year by then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who cranked up the pace of government borrowing while anticipating a big relief bill could come. \"Early on in the COVID crisis, I made sure we always had ample funds on hand to be prepared for any needed economic response,\" Mnuchin said in an email to Politico. He quadrupled the size of the rainy-day fund. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on ABC\\'s \"This Week\" that she is confident the inflation risk from additional borrowing is \"small\" and \"manageable.\" The American Rescue Plan Act is \"the right size to address the very significant problem that we have,\" Yellen said. \"We need to defeat the pandemic. This package really does that.\" More coronavirus news See a roundup of the latest regional pandemic developments on Long Island and beyond by Newsday\\'s Lisa L. Colangelo and Vera Chinese.

Cuomo should \"look inside his heart … to see if he can govern effectively\" amid ever-growing calls to resign over allegations of sexual harassment, reports Newsday\\'s Eidler. New York\\'s two senators have called on Cuomo to go, including Schumer, who told MSNBC that the state needs \"sure and steady leadership\" to keep up the fight against COVID-19 and that Cuomo has \"lost the confidence of his governing partners and of so many New Yorkers.\"  Biden, asked by reporters upon his return from a Delaware weekend Sunday evening whether Cuomo should resign, responded: \"I think the investigation is underway, and we should see what it brings us.\"  The Biden administration is deploying FEMA to the Mexican border to help care for thousands of unaccompanied migrant teens and children who are overwhelming the capacity of facilities to care for them, the Department of Homeland Security said.  Dropped from Biden\\'s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief legislation was a $2 billion competitive grant program for schools that would give the federal government a more central role in promoting racial equity by combating long-standing educational disparities, The Washington Post reports. Advocates warned that the cost burden of competing would have the opposite of the intended effect on poorer districts.  Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said Sunday that Senate Democrats will push to make permanent two provisions of the COVID-19 relief legislation that provide emergency enhanced benefits for the poor through food assistance and child tax credits.  An Army reservist charged with taking part in the Capitol riot was known to co-workers as a Nazi sympathizer who wore a Hitler mustache, according to federal prosecutors. Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, 30, employed as a security contractor at a Navy base in New Jersey, said he would \"kill all the Jews\" and made derogatory remarks about Black people, other minorities and women, the prosecutors said.    Dr Anthony Fauci has said \\'wildly popular\\' Donald Trump could be a \\'game changer\\' if he tells his supporters to get the COVID-19 vaccine.\\xa0\\xa0 Almost half of Republican men say they will not get the vaccine when it is available to them compared with just six percent of Democrat men, according to a new poll. Asked whether Trump should speak to his supporters directly, given those numbers, Fauci told Fox News: \\'I think it would make all the difference in the world.\\'\\xa0 Trump, Fauci said, \\'is a such a strongly popular person...it would be very helpful for the effort for that to happen.\\' Fauci added: \\'If he came out and said, \"Go and get vaccinated.

He’s a very wildly popular person among Republicans.\\'\\xa0 Though it wasn\\'t publicized at the time, Trump and First Lady Melania Trump got the vaccine in January before they left the White House, a Trump adviser told DailyMail.com in February.\\xa0 In a round of interviews on the morning news shows, the government\\'s top infectious disease expert said politics needs to be separated from \\'commonsense, no-brainer\\' public health measures.\\xa0  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n Copy link to paste in your message\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  Anthony Fauci has said \\'wildly popular\\' Donald Trump could be a \\'game changer\\' if he tells his supporters to get the COVID-19 vaccine   \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n Copy link to paste in your message\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  Trump did tell supporters at the Conservative Political Action Conference, pictured, last month: \\'How unpainful that vaccine shot is, so everybody go get your shot.\\' It was the first time he had encouraged people to do so  Fauci said: \\'It seems like an intrinsic contradiction that you had a program that was started during this presidency and he’s not out telling people to get vaccinated, but I wish he would. \\'He has such incredible influence over the people in the Republican Party, it would really be a game-changer if he did.\\'\\xa0 Trump did tell supporters at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month: \\'How unpainful that vaccine shot is, so everybody go get your shot.\\'\\xa0 It was the first time he had encouraged people to do so.\\xa0 Fauci said on NBC\\'s \\'Meet the Press\\' program: \\'How such a large proportion of a certain group of people would not want to get vaccinated merely because of political considerations...it makes absolutely no sense,\\' Fauci said. The other living former U.S. presidents - Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter - are set to appear in two public service announcements for the coronavirus vaccine alongside their wives, without Trump. President Joe Biden and other political leaders received their shots publicly to encourage Americans to get vaccinated.\\xa0 Getting the vaccine is \\'no brainer,\\' Fauci told \\'Meet the Press,\\' as he listed some of the diseases that vaccines had wiped out such as small pox. \\'What is the problem here? This is a vaccine that is going to be lifesaving for millions of people,\\' Fauci said. Fauci is the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and an adviser to Biden. Trump early in the pandemic appeared at coronavirus briefings with Fauci but later turned on him. Trump in October, weeks after being hospitalized for three days for COVID-19 treatment, criticized Fauci, saying, \\'Fauci is a disaster. People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots.\\' As president, Trump minimized the need for coronavirus restrictions including wearing masks and predicted the pathogen would disappear \\'like a miracle.\\'  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n Copy link to paste in your message\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  Asked whether Trump should speak to his supporters directly, given those poll numbers, Fauci told Fox News\\' Chris Wallace, left: \\'I think it would make all the difference in the world  Fauci on Sunday underscored his call for officials around the United States not to lift restrictions prematurely and risk a spike in COVID-19 cases. Some states such as Texas have lifted mask-wearing and other restrictions. An uptick in cases can be avoided if Americans continue to get vaccinated \\'without all of a sudden pulling back on public health measures,\\' Fauci told CNN\\'s \\'State of the Union\\' program. \\'We will gradually be able to pull them (restrictions) back. And if things go as we planned, just as the president said, by the time we get into the early summer, the Fourth of July weekend, we really will have a considerable degree of normality.\\xa0 \\'But we don\\'t want to let that escape from our grasp by being too precipitous in pulling back,\\' Fauci added. The number of vaccine doses distributed and administered each day in the U.S. is rising, with more than 2.5 million daily shots in arms on average in the last week. About 1 in 5 Americans have received at least one dose, with about 1 in 9 fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The coronavirus is blamed for over 530,000 deaths in the United States. Deaths and newly confirmed infections per day have tumbled over the past two months. But cases are running at a still-troubling average of about 55,000 a day.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n Copy link to paste in your message\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  Almost half of men who identify as Republicans say they will not get the COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to them and nor will almost half of Donald Trump supporters, according to a poll released by PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll Thursday (above)  A poll, released by PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll last Thursday, surveyed 1,227 US adults from March 3 to March 8 about their views on taking one of the three vaccines approved by the federal government.\\xa0 It uncovered stark differences in opinion depending on political beliefs with 49 percent of Republican men saying they would not be taking the shot.\\xa0 More than a third (34 percent) of Republican women also said they will not get vaccinated, compared to just 14 percent of Democrat women. Overall, around two-fifths (41 percent) of Republicans said they will not get the vaccine, while 24 percent said they have already been administered it and 3 percent were unsure.\\xa0 By contrast, almost two-third of Democrats (58 percent) said they will take the vaccine when they are eligible, with 29 percent having already had it, and 2 percent unsure. Just 11 percent of Democrat supporters said they would not take the vaccine.\\xa0\\xa0 The survey shows an ongoing distrust in the COVID-19 vaccine among a large proportion of the US population as Joe Biden announced this week all Americans will be eligible for vaccination no later than May 1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The poll also found a high amount of opposition among Trump supporters, with 47 percent saying they will not get the vaccine compared to just 10 percent of Biden supporters who said the same.\\xa0\\xa0 Survey respondents were also asked about their views of how Biden has handled the pandemic since taking office. Overall, 62 percent said they approved and 30 percent disapproved.\\xa0 Unsurprisingly, the approval rating fell to 30 percent among Republicans and 22 percent among Trump supporters.\\xa0\\xa0 Aside from political belief as a factor, ethnic minority groups have long been more skeptical about getting the vaccine.

Most are Democrats, but one key investigation was launched by a Georgia Republican who has faced heavy criticism from Trump since the election.\\nAnd the former President’s actions on his way out of office, including his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results and to stir up his supporters with baseless claims of fraud until they stormed the US Capitol on a harrowing January day, have only added to his legal problems.\\n“It’s never happened in our history but every single one of these prosecutors and attorneys general has more than sufficient predication to investigate what they’re investigating,” said Daniel R. Alonso, who was a top deputy to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance from 2010 to 2014.\\nThere are signs the probes are picking up. In New York, investigators recently got their hands on Trump’s tax returns and have bolstered their team with a prosecutor who specializes in complex financial cases. In Georgia, another prosecutor plans to begin requesting subpoenas from a grand jury as early as this week.\\n“The world has changed for Donald Trump, legally, now that he’s no longer president,” said Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and a CNN legal analyst. “Donald Trump tried to delay civil suits against him, he tried to delay subpoenas against him while he was president. All of that is gone now, so now we’re seeing multiple investigators — federal and state — digging in and taking a hard look at Donald Trump.”\\nAll eyes on the Empire State \\nIn Manhattan, all eyes are on Vance, who has been investigating Trump’s finances for two years and is not expected to run for reelection.\\nThe Democrat has 10 months left in his term — setting the clock, some said, for him to wrap up his investigation.\\n“It’s likely that the case, if it is charged, would be charged before Vance leaves office,” said Anne Milgram, a former attorney general for New Jersey and former federal prosecutor.\\n“That’s because that’s 10 months away — which is a long time in a criminal investigation — and because the DA’s office had previously noted that there were statutes of limitations timing issues,” she said.\\nProsecutors have already interviewed witnesses, subpoenaed documents from lenders, an insurance broker and others, and last month recruited a former federal prosecutor with a background in complex financial investigations to bolster their team.\\nLast week investigators also received a trove of records, including tax returns, financial statements, and communications between the Trump Organization and Mazars, Trump’s long-time accountant, after the Supreme Court denied Trump’s latest bid to block Vance from accessing those records.\\n“I think the goal will be to move quickly and, if they believe a crime has been committed, they will move to present the case to the grand jury within months, not years,” Milgram said.\\nVance, the son of a former US secretary of state and Washington insider, spent the better part of his legal career as a white-collar criminal defense lawyer. He ran for district attorney and was sworn into office in 2010 after a more than 30-year run by his predecessor Robert Morgenthau.\\nHe has been innovative in pursuing some cases and in 2019, Vance’s office obtained the first conviction on state domestic terrorism charges. \\nBut some of his victories have been tinged by controversy.\\nWhen Vance brought criminal charges against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein for sexual assault following the rise of the #metoo movement, Weinstein’s conviction was hailed as a “new era of justice” by Time’s Up, a women’s advocacy group. But it came only after an earlier decision in 2015 to decline to prosecute Weinstein after an Italian model accused him of groping her and recorded Weinstein on tape saying, “I won’t do it again.”\\nVance was also criticized for not prosecuting Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, who were investigated in 2012 for allegedly misleading potential buyers for units in the Trump SoHo, a New York hotel property. In both instances, lawyers for the individuals had donated to Vance’s campaign.\\nVance defended himself, telling reporters in 2017 that the donations had no impact on his thinking. His office said the allegations against Weinstein were “horrifying” but there was not sufficient evidence to charge him.\\n“At the end of the day, we operate in the courtroom of the law, not the courtroom of public opinion,” Vance said.\\nAlonso, the former Vance deputy, has previously said sometimes a district attorney is successful by deciding not to file charges.\\nOn the Trump investigation, he said, Vance will not be political.\\n“He knows that the job is not to lick your finger and hold it up to the wind and decide which way the wind is blowing before you make a decision,” Alonso said. “He will look at the evidence and decide who he believes is guilty and whether he can prove it.”\\nAnother New York investigation\\nOne of the biggest thorns in Trump’s side has been New York Attorney General Letitia James.\\nWhen James was running for office in 2018, she campaigned on a pledge to investigate everything from Trump’s policies to his finances.\\n“I’m running for attorney general because I will never be afraid to challenge this illegitimate president when our fundamental rights are at stake,” James said at the time.\\nHer record since has shown that she meant it: She challenged the Trump administration’s addition of a citizen question to the US census, pushed for the New York legislature to pass a law to close a presidential pardon loophole, and wrapped up a lawsuit brought by her predecessor that led to the dissolution of the Trump Foundation.\\nNow her office is digging into Trump’s business and personal finances, exploring whether assets were improperly valued and if banks or tax authorities were defrauded. James has won court victories with a judge compelling Eric Trump, who co-runs the day-to-day operations of Trump Organization, to sit for a deposition and ordering Trump’s tax lawyer to turn over reams of documents.\\nJames has been a trailblazer, becoming the first African American woman to hold city-wide office when she was elected New York City’s public advocate in 2013 and then the first woman elected to serve as New York’s attorney general and first African American woman to hold statewide office. Her political ambitions are not limited to the AG’s office. She has mused about running for mayor and some have speculated she could make a bid for governor if Andrew Cuomo does not run again for office.\\nCuomo backed James in her bid for attorney general but their ties have recently been tested. James issued a scathing report in January finding the New York Department of Health undercounted Covid-19 deaths among nursing home residents by about 50%, setting off a political crisis for Cuomo.\\nOver the weekend, she publicly pushed back on Cuomo’s plans to investigate sexual harassment claims brought against him. Cuomo initially said he would appoint a retired federal judge to investigate the claims by two women. When that move was met with harsh criticism, he then said he would ask James and the chief judge in New York to appoint an independent investigator. Ultimately, he ceded ground to James who alone will select an independent law firm to investigate the allegations against the governor.\\nCuomo says he never inappropriately touched or propositioned anyone, but did apologize to anyone who may have misinterpreted his comments in the workplace as unwanted flirtation.\\n“She’s been a strong independent voice throughout her career,” said Robert Abrams, New York attorney general from 1978-1994 and a member of James’ transition team. “All of this demonstrates that she has shown courage and tenacity for what she believes is right, what is her duty and responsibility.”\\nTrump has seized on James’ past comments, saying her actions against him are politically motivated. In a court filing challenging Vance’s subpoena for his tax returns, Trump’s lawyers quoted James nine times, including when she said, “I will be shining a bright light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings.”\\nJames said Trump is wrong about her.\\n“I’m not biased. I represent the state—all individuals, all citizens in the state of New York, whether you’re Republican and or Democrat,” James told Marie Claire in January. “That is my duty and that is the mission.”\\nGeorgia’s GOP investigator \\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s office is also investigating Trump, for his attempts to overturn the state’s election results.\\nWhen Trump lost the presidential election, no state official was in his crosshairs more than Raffensperger, a lifelong Republican. Even as tension and pressure from Trump were on public display, Georgia’s top election official said he had supported Trump and publicly stated multiple times that he wished Trump had won.\\nBut while saying he was personally disappointed in the results as a conservative Republican, Raffensperger steadfastly refused to give credence to a litany of conspiracy theories bolstered by the then-President alleging election fraud in Georgia.\\nSince the rioting at the US Capitol on January 6, Raffensperger has offered a more critical take on Trump’s actions.\\n“Many of the actions that he’s taken since then are not what you would expect from a president,” Raffensperger told CNN in January. “I’ve said from day one that we have to be really mindful of our speech because we can’t spin people up and play people and get them into an emotional frenzy.”\\nRaffensperger’s is the rare Republican-led investigation, made more awkward by the fact that Raffensperger was a direct witness to Trump’s attempts to influence the outcome of the election.\\nA source familiar with the Georgia secretary of state’s investigation confirmed officials are looking at two calls. One is the January phone call, of which CNN obtained the audio. In it,Trump pushed Raffensperger to “find” votes to overturn the election results after his loss to Biden. The other involves a call Trump made on December 23, to a Georgia election investigator in the secretary of state’s office who was leading a probe into allegations of ballot fraud in Cobb County. Trump is heard asking the chief investigator with Raffensperger’s office to to search for dishonesty in the 2020 presidential election, telling the individual that the investigation was of national importance, according to a source with knowledge of the call.\\nTrump’s senior adviser, Jason Miller, said in a statement last month that there was nothing “improper or untoward” about the call between Trump and Raffensperger.\\n“And the only reason the call became public was because Mr. Raffensperger leaked it in an attempt to score political points,” Miller’s statement said.\\nRaffensperger’s office declined to comment, saying they don’t comment on active investigations.\\nTwenty investigators work in Raffensperger’s office statewide, and the team has a lot on its plate. They’re currently working on 252 cases from 2020 that are open or pending presentation to the state election board, a source familiar with the Georgia secretary of state’s investigations confirmed to CNN.\\nThe office investigates every complaint it receives and described the investigations as “fact-finding and administrative in nature,” according to a statement on February 8, the day it opened an inquiry into the infamous calls.\\nOnce Raffensperger’s office completes its investigation, the findings will be reported to the state election board, which may decide that probable cause merits there was a violation, and that the case should be referred to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis or additionally, Georgia’s attorney general for further investigation, according to two people familiar with the process.\\nGeorgia digs in on election meddling\\nIn addition to the investigation by Raffensperger’s office, Willis is looking into Trump’s call to the Georgia secretary of state, looking to sway Georgia’s election results in his favor.\\nWhen that call took place on January 2, Willis had only been in office one day. By early February, her office began firing off letters to Georgia officials asking them to preserve documents related to attempts to influence the state’s election as she investigates potential crimes including the solicitation of election fraud, conspiracy and racketeering. According to the letters, none of the Georgia officials are targets of the investigation.\\nThe probe instantly elevated the newly elected prosecutor’s national profile. But it also irked some Georgia residents who believe the focus on Trump will drain attention and resources from local issues in Fulton County, which includes much of the city of Atlanta.\\nThose who know Willis, though, were unsurprised to see her forge ahead.\\n“There’s some evidence saying a law might’ve been broken. It might’ve been done in her jurisdiction, she’s going to investigate it,” said Charlie Bailey, who previously worked closely with Willis in the district attorney’s office and is running for state attorney general in 2022. “I know it is different because it’s a former president. I do realize that, and I know she realizes that too, but she takes that very seriously.”\\nWillis, a Democrat and a longtime prosecutor, ousted her former boss to become the county’s first female district attorney in January. She and her staff have been juggling an avalanche of interest in the Trump investigation with an office that was already buckling under its caseload, according to a source familiar with the investigation.\\nOne of her first moves was asking the state attorney general to reassign two high-profile cases against Atlanta police officers for alleged use of excessive force, including in the shooting death of Rayshard Brooks. Her critics believe it’s a sign her priorities are elsewhere.\\n“If the DA’s office has time and the resources and all the time and manpower to do that — go after Trump for this election stuff or whatever — just make sure that the civil rights cases that are in her county are treated equally and take the same kind of priority,” said Chris Stewart, a lawyer for the Brooks family.\\n“What do we do now?” Stewart asked. “Families are stuck in the middle.”\\nMeantime, Willis has said her Trump investigation will stretch beyond Trump’s call with Raffensperger to include any efforts to influence the election in Georgia.\\nShe has said in interviews she may begin requesting subpoenas from a grand jury as early as March. And that grand jury will draw from a pool of constituents in Fulton County unlikely to be sympathetic to Trump: President Joe Biden won the county with nearly 73% of the vote in November.\\n“I have no idea what I’m going to find,” Willis told CNN affiliate WSB last month. “A good law enforcement officer, a good prosecutor, you walk in with an open mind.”\\nWillis is perhaps best known in Georgia for her role in the 2014 prosecution of a dozen educators accused of being involved in a cheating scandal. Eleven were convicted on racketeering charges.\\nHer former colleagues said she’s unlikely to be intimidated by taking on the former President. But she has acknowledged doubling her security amid threats.\\n“Interestingly enough, the comments are always racist. And it’s really just a waste of time and foolishness,” Willis told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow last month. “It’s not going to stop me from doing my job, and I don’t think that it’s an insult to remind me that I am a Black woman.”\\nAnother crack at Trump in DC\\nFor Karl Racine, there’s perhaps little downside in pursuing yet another case against Trump.\\nRacine, who became Washington, DC’s first elected attorney general when he took office in 2015, serves a constituency that overwhelmingly favors Democrats. In 2020, 92% of the District voted for Biden.\\nRacine previously took on Trump in a lawsuit alleging conflicts between the then-President’s business interests and his oath of office. The lawsuit was rendered moot when Trump left office.\\nFor Racine’s latest pursuit, it appears to be a waiting game as prosecutors investigate whether the former President’s alleged role in the insurrection violated the city’s incitement of violence law, and determine whether it’s best to partner with the US attorney’s office.\\n“They don’t want to bring charges without the cooperation of the federal government,” former DC Attorney General Bob Spagnoletti said. “They’re not going to step out on a limb here.”\\nRacine’s office only enforces local codes for the city, while the prosecution of both major and federal crimes falls under the purview of the Justice Department.\\nRacine has said he is focused on the incitement of violence charge available to him under the DC code, but the charge only carries a maximum of six months in prison, and legal experts note Racine wouldn’t have the authority to force Trump back to Washington to appear in court.\\nSpagnoletti points out it would be most advantageous for Racine to work in connection with the US attorney in DC, especially since only that office has the power to convene a grand jury.\\n“Because Karl Racine doesn’t have one, he needs to be able to work with the US attorney to gather evidence expeditiously, and not grind it to a halt which is what will happen without a coordinated strategy,” Spagnoletti said.\\nActing US Attorney Michael Sherwin has said his office will weigh potentially charging all actors involved in the insurrection but has declined to elaborate on whether that also means Trump. It’s unclear if Sherwin will remain in his post if Merrick Garland is confirmed as US attorney general.\\nRacine did reveal in January that his office was “collaborating at a high level with federal prosecutors.”\\n  Editor’s note:   An earlier version of this story, published March 1, presented paraphrasing of the President’s comments to the Georgia elections investigator as direct quotes. The story has been updated following the discovery of an audio recording of the call.

In a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll released last week, about half of U.S. men who identified themselves as Republicans said they had no plans to get the vaccine. Asked whether Trump should speak to his supporters directly, given those poll numbers, Fauci said on the “Fox News Sunday” program: “I think it would make all the difference in the world.” Trump, Fauci said, “is a such a strongly popular person ... it would be very helpful for the effort for that to happen.” Trump told attendees at a conservative conference last month to get vaccinated - saying, “everybody, go get your shot” - the first time he had encouraged people to do so. Fauci said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program: “How such a large proportion of a certain group of people would not want to get vaccinated merely because of political considerations ... it makes absolutely no sense,” Fauci said. The other living former U.S. presidents - Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter - are set to appear in two public service announcements for the coronavirus vaccine alongside their wives, without Trump. President Joe Biden and other political leaders received their shots publicly to encourage Americans to get vaccinated. Trump was vaccinated privately in the White House in January, the New York Times has reported. Getting the vaccine is “no brainer,” Fauci told “Meet the Press,” as he listed some of the diseases that vaccines had wiped out such as small pox. “What is the problem here? This is a vaccine that is going to be lifesaving for millions of people,” Fauci said. Fauci is the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and an adviser to Biden. Trump early in the pandemic appeared at coronavirus briefings with Fauci but later turned on him. Trump in October, weeks after being hospitalized for three days for COVID-19 treatment, criticized Fauci, saying, “Fauci is a disaster. ... People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots.” As president, Trump minimized the need for coronavirus restrictions including wearing masks and predicted the pathogen would disappear “like a miracle.” Fauci on Sunday underscored his call for officials around the United States not to lift restrictions prematurely and risk a spike in COVID-19 cases. Some states such as Texas have lifted mask-wearing and other restrictions. An uptick in cases can be avoided if Americans continue to get vaccinated “without all of a sudden pulling back on public health measures,” Fauci told CNN’s “State of the Union” program. “We will gradually be able to pull them (restrictions) back. And if things go as we planned, just as the president said, by the time we get into the early summer, the Fourth of July weekend, we really will have a considerable degree of normality. But we don’t want to let that escape from our grasp by being too precipitous in pulling back,” Fauci added.

Wallace asked Fauci, the nation\\'s top infectious disease expert, how much of a difference it would make if Mr. Trump led a campaign to urge Republicans to get vaccinated. Fauci replied: \"It would make all the difference in the world.\" \"He\\'s a very widely popular person among Republicans,\" Fauci continued. \"If he came out and said, \\'Go and get vaccinated. It\\'s really important for your health, the health of your family and the health of the country,\\' it seems absolutely inevitable that the vast majority of people who are his close followers would listen to him.\" A recent\\xa0CBS News poll found\\xa034% of Republicans say they don\\'t plan to get the vaccine, while only 10% of Democrats say they\\'ll abstain. Fauci added that he is very surprised that a high percentage of Republicans are avoiding the vaccine, saying doesn\\'t understand why. \"This isn\\'t a political issue, this is a public health issue,\" he said. Mr. Trump and former first lady Melania Trump\\xa0got vaccinated pirvately at the White House in January, while other top GOP officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, got the shot on television in a public show of support. Mr. Trump has not publicly mentioned that he was inoculated, though he did encourage others to take the vaccine when he spoke at the\\xa0Conservative Political Action Conference\\xa0in Florida. Fauci, who served on the White House coronavirus task force for both Mr. Trump and President Biden, noted that it was the Trump\\'s administration\\'s \"Operation Warp Speed\" that helped enable the quick approval and production of vaccines. He said it is a contradiction that Mr. Trump isn\\'t now urging the public to get vaccinated. \"I wish he would. He has such an influence over people in the Republican Party. It would really be a game changer if he did,\" Fauci said. Fauci also said he is confident about meeting President Biden\\'s goal of every American over 18 being eligible for a vaccine by May 1, and he agreed with Mr. Biden\\'s prediction that if people keep observing social distancing and wearing masks, it should be safe to hold small gatherings for the Fourth of July. On Friday, the U.S. shot past the milestone of administering\\xa0100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine. According to\\xa0figures posted\\xa0by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 11% of the total U.S. population is now fully vaccinated, and 21% of Americans have received at least one dose.

Trump\\xa0hinted at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in February that he may run again for president in 2024. \"I may even decide to beat them for a third time,\" Trump said, referring to his false claims to have beaten Joe Biden in last year\\'s presidential election. However, Mary Trump predicted that the president would merely \"pretend\" to be preparing to run in 2024 as a means to retain his popularity with the GOP base in order to raise money.\\n \\n \"It\\'s important to remember that Donald couldn\\'t care less about politics, he couldn\\'t care less about this country, he couldn\\'t care less about the Republicans,\" Mary Trump, a clinical psychologist who last year published a tell-all book on her family, told Insider. \"It\\'s all about maintaining the grip on power. He thinks on some level it\\'s going to allow him to continue to operate with impunity as he has done his whole life, and also it\\'s going to allow him to keep grifting money off of people,\" she said. \"I\\'ve said all along he has no intention to run for the presidency in 2024. He\\'s going to pretend to. And in the meantime, he\\'s going to keep the Republican party on his toes so they continue to do his bidding.\" The period since losing the election been lucrative for Trump: He raised at least $150 million since November to challenge his election defeat and reportedly more than $30 million through his Save America PAC alone, which was founded to fund his political future.\\n \\n Trump this week\\xa0emailed supporters this week urging them to send donations to his Save America PAC\\xa0instead of the Republican National Committee, warning them not to donate to RINOs, or Republicans in name only — likely describing members of Congress who opposed him. The former president\\'s email read: \"No more money for RINOS. They do nothing but hurt the Republican Party and our great voting base — they will never lead us to Greatness.

He\\'s a public figure so it\\'s embarrassingly absurd.\" The former president has retained a strong grip on his party since leaving office. Senior Republican senators have started to defend him in recent weeks after initially distancing themselves from him following the Capitol riot on January 6. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the House Minority leader, said he would \"absolutely\" support Trump as a presidential nominee in 2024 weeks after he said that President Trump was \"practically and morally responsible\" for the January 6 riot. Sen. Lindsey Graham, meanwhile, said that he remained loyal to the former president because he wanted to \"harness\" his \"magic.\"\\n \\n Donald Trump\\'s successors will fail, says Mary Trump \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n President Donald Trump greets Senator Ted Cruz upon arrival on Air Force One at Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base in Houston, Texas, October 22, 2018, as he travels to hold a campaign rally with Cruz.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  Mary Trump said that other Republicans who had pushed President Trump\\'s baseless election claims, including Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley and former Vice-President Mike Pence, would be unsuccessful in capturing Trump\\'s support base for their own possible presidential runs because they lack his \"charisma.\" \"These are people who made the calculation that their best bet is to stick with Donald and emulate him in any way they can or maybe outdo his extremism,\" she said. \"What they don\\'t seem to understand is that even though Donald is a logical conclusion to the direction in which the Republican party has been trending for a very long time, not one of those people has the — I hate using this word for Donald but unfortunately, it\\'s accurate — charisma.\" \"He has a certain charisma that appeals to people\\'s lowest and basest instinct and gives permission to people to be their worst selves. He can be charming, it makes sense to me that people can be taken in by him.

And then there was everybody else.” In the months leading up to the release of COVID-19 vaccines, all three branches of government held classified meetings to refine the far smaller list of federal employees critical enough to get a direct vaccination. That list—which was separate from both the state spreadsheets and the allocations that General Perna divvied up among the five agencies—covered such high-value individuals as Supreme Court justices and intelligence agents in the field. But in the last week of November, General Perna upended that process too, Vanity Fair has learned. He declared to those involved that any federal agency wanting a direct allocation had to come brief him in person. Perna’s team informed National Security Council officials that if they wanted to save the list that had been months in the making, they would have to come “kiss the ring.” Those whose agencies had employees on the list, such as the director of national intelligence, got similar instructions. Suddenly what had been an organized, well-considered process became an arbitrary one, overseen by Perna. The question was why? Some with knowledge of the process suspected that, due to manufacturing and dosage shortfalls, Perna could not deliver on commitments he’d made to the states, and so he was trying to whittle down the allocation to federal employees. (On December 19, Perna acknowledged overpromising to the states, saying, “I want to take personal responsibility for the miscommunication.”) In the second week of December, in a secure meeting room, several NSC officials defended their plan for the roughly 12,000 direct allocations in a meeting with Perna and a handful of his deputies. Tensions erupted almost immediately, according to three officials familiar with what occurred. After listening to the NSC request, Perna refused to sign off. Evidently unimpressed with the seniority of the NSC emissaries, he said, “I don’t take orders from a child. You can have your adult” give me directions. As tempers flared, Perna added, “I don’t give a damn what you people think.” According to the officials, Brian Cavanaugh, a special assistant to the president and senior director for resilience policy at the NSC, told Perna, “You need a piece of paper in writing, so when you get subpoenaed by Congress, you can feel good about yourself.” Cavanaugh then pointedly violated protocol by standing up to leave without waiting for the four-star general to do so first. (Cavanaugh declined to comment.) It was “a dick-measuring contest between the NSC and Perna,” said a former White House official. Ultimately, Meadows and Secretary Azar—the so-called adults—did weigh in, and the allocations were approved. By the latter part of December, as the contested doses destined for essential employees arrived at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, doctors from the three branches of government met there to sign for them. On December 13, The New York Times reported that senior White House staff were told they would soon begin getting vaccinated. The news sparked an outcry. Why, critics asked, should an administration that had so flagrantly violated COVID-19 safeguards have access to the vaccine when elderly nursing home residents were dying in droves? Trump reversed himself almost immediately, tweeting that day, “People working in the White House should receive the vaccine somewhat later in the program, unless specifically necessary. I have asked that this adjustment be made. I am not scheduled to take the vaccine, but look forward to doing so at the appropriate time. Thank you!” That same day Trump made it clear that he wanted the White House’s allotment of vaccinations to go to the career staff—who, it’s worth noting, were in fact being endangered by politicians and appointees who insisted on working and carousing without wearing masks or social distancing. In an Oval Office briefing, Trump gave “very clear direction” to vaccinate career employees and prioritize government continuity, said the former senior administration official. Still, the “specifically necessary” wording in Trump’s tweet gave those angling for vaccinations room to continue maneuvering, as the back channel clamor for them grew. It also left room for some justifiable additions. Trump’s director of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, who had suffered a heart attack in 2018—and who publicly played down the pandemic’s severity—got a vaccination to protect his health. Kudlow, who is 73, told Vanity Fair that he was “super grateful” to be vaccinated, adding that he regarded it “as a miracle that I didn’t get COVID” from working at the White House. “There were one or two of us who escaped it,” he added. While vaccinations within the judicial branch ran smoothly, the legislative branch was the “Wild West,” said the former senior administration official. There were “500-plus people who all think they’re in charge,” and therefore crucial to government operations. To federal employees the seemingly arbitrary rationing of vaccinations has provided a bitter reminder of their own dispensability. Employees at the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, who had been instrumental in developing vaccines, watched as federal employees working on Operation Warp Speed received their shots. “The scientists aren’t getting vaccinated,” griped a BARDA employee, “but the notetakers are.” The perception of inequity and lack of transparency have persisted into the Biden administration. In early February the State Department notified a wide swath of employees, including many who were healthy, young, and telecommuting, that they were now eligible to get the vaccine, advising them to report to a vaccine walk-in clinic at the State Department headquarters. This left even some State Department employees wondering whether the Biden administration’s talk of equity was hollow. “I can understand having Moderna and Pfizer for colleagues who are at embassies,” said one State Department employee. “But we have had the luxury of teleworking, not traveling internationally.” According to a spokesperson, the State Department “weighs the availability of COVID-19 vaccine doses against the risk posed to our workforce at each post and domestic facility when assessing how many vaccine doses” to make available and to whom. As it turned out, Donald and Melania Trump were vaccinated at the White House in January, out of the public eye. After saying the doses should be reserved for career staff, he evidently made an exception for himself. Which raises the question: Did he actually think his effort to overturn the election would succeed, meaning that he had a role to play in “continuity of government”? Or was the president, like the rest of us, just trying to survive?  Additional reporting by Stan Friedman.   CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the date of General Perna’s public comments on vaccine allocation shortfalls. It was December 19, not December 18.

We shouldn\\'t maltreat our idols: the gilt comes off on our hands.-- Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary   It was such a huge hit at CPAC in Miami that it\\'s hard to know where to begin describing it. I refer, of course, to the six-foot-tall golden sculpture of the trump that was on display at the gathering. The upper part of the sculpture wears a jacket and tie, and the lower half somewhat incongruously, at least to this observer, is wearing a pair of shorts that are a likeness of the American flag. To complete the sculpture, the sculpture is wearing slip flops. The sculpture itself is made of fiberglass and weighs about 200 pounds. Its genesis and its creation are of almost as much interest as the finished product. According to reports, the model for the sculpture was not the trump himself but a likeness of him that can be found online in what is known as a \"Trump Bobblehead.\" The trump bobbleheads have various incarnations but are amazing replicas of the trump himself. They are called bobbleheads because the head of the figure is loosely attached to the model itself so that it can move in almost any direction when the figure is moved, movement that is described as \"boggling.\" That could easily have been the word used to described the trump\\'s actions during the time he lived in the White House. When the sculpture first entered our consciousness we were told it had been created by Tommy Zegan. Tommy describes himself as a long-time trump fan and told reporters that he began working on the sculpture in 2018. He said that the actual sculpture was made in Rosarito, Mexico. Notwithstanding Tommy\\'s statement that the sculpture was made in Mexico, we soon learned that it had in fact not been made in Mexico, but had been made in China. Zegan resisted initially disclosing that fact because of the trump\\'s dislike of China and his attribution to China of the Corona virus. Although Tommy initially took all the credit for the creation of the sculpture, it turns out he had a collaborator. The collaborator was Mexican artist Jose Mauricio Mendoza. Jose explained that his participation in the creation of the sculpture was not disclosed because it was thought that trump supporters would not be interested in admiring or buying a sculpture made by a Mexican. In one video describing the project, however, Jose is described as \"art director and co-founder\" thus giving credit where credit was due. The sculpture was the hit of the conference to no one\\'s great surprise. Throughout the conference, attendees were seen standing by the sculpture having their pictures taken. In response to those who said that the sculpture was an idol, however, Mr. Zegan said the sculpture was definitely not an idol. As he explained, \"An idol is something somebody worships and bows down to. This is a sculpture. It\\'s two different things.\" He may have been prompted to make that explanation because of a widely circulated photo of the sculpture that had been doctored to show a group of evangelical leaders praying over the sculpture. Such a gathering had not in fact taken place. The picture was altered to create that impression. That does not mean that there was no prayerful adoration of the trump at the CPAC gathering-just not of his statue. There were unlimited speeches by the likes of Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley that consisted of prayerful adoration of the trump and all his many accomplishments. The sculpture on display at the CPAC conference has now been retired. It is being auctioned on eBay. As of this writing the highest bid is $50,200. Given the great success of the work, it is a virtual certainty additional bids will come in when an adoring public discovers that the sculpture is for sale. Tommy hopes that the sale of the sculpture to a private investor will not mark the end of the sculpture\\'s life as a public memorial to the trump. That is because Tommy\\'s creative skills were not limited to the fiberglass version on display at the conference and now being sold on eBay. Tommy also created a stainless-steel version of the sculpture. And his hopes for where that sculpture may reside has suggested an answer to one question that has been on many lips since the trump left the White House. The question is, what should be put in a trump presidential library. The trump presidential library should house the many different kinds of television sets that were in use during the trump\\'s years in the White House. They should be tuned to different channels playing recordings of the trump visiting with commentators on Fox news and similar news outlets, as well as reruns of the trump\\'s most exciting public appearances before adoring crowds. Other sets should display the thousands of presidential tweets created by him during his tenure. Tommy\\'s suggestion of adding a stainless-steel sculpture of the trump wearing a coat, tie, American flag shorts and flip flops, would not only lend dignity to what might otherwise seem an informal display, but would add a touch of class to the trump presidential library that it may otherwise be lacking. Thanks to the inclusion of their sculpture in the library, Tommy and Jose would, like trump, be forever remembered for their great accomplishment.   WASHINGTON\\xa0– Former President Donald Trump said he would urge his supporters to get the COVID-19 vaccine, but he acknowledged that some of them may refuse in the name of \"freedom.\" \"I would recommend it, and I would recommend it to a lot of people that don\\'t want to get it,\" Trump told Fox News in a 20-minute telephone interview Tuesday. Trump noted \"a lot of those people\" who don\\'t want the vaccine \"voted for me, frankly.\\xa0But ...\\xa0again, we have our freedoms, and we have to live by that, and I agree with that also.\" In early January, before leaving the White House, Trump and then-first lady Melania Trump received the vaccine\\xa0but did not disclose that fact publicly. \"It\\'s a great vaccine, it\\'s a safe vaccine, and it\\'s something that works,\" Trump told Fox News\\'\\xa0Maria Bartiromo.  More: Donald Trump, Melania Trump secretly received COVID-19 vaccine in January   More: All living ex-U.S. presidents, except Trump, appear in ad touting COVID-19 vaccine  Surveys show that some people don\\'t want to get the vaccine because they fear side effects or other medical problems, though\\xa0repeated trials have showed the vaccines are safe. Polls show Republican men and Trump supporters are among the top groups\\xa0who resist the vaccine. Trump was the only former president\\xa0to not participate in a public service ad asking Americans to take the shots. On Monday, Biden said he wouldn\\'t wait on help from Trump in getting people vaccinated.\\xa0 \"I discussed it with my team,\" he said, \"and they say the thing that has more impact than anything Trump would say to the MAGA folks is what the local doctor, what the local preacher, what the local people in the community say.\"   Dr. Anthony Fauci, a top medical expert for both Trump and Biden, had urged the\\xa0former president to ask supporters to get vaccinated, saying it would make a huge difference. \"He\\'s such a strongly popular person. I cannot imagine that if he comes out that they would not get vaccinated,\" Fauci said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"It would be very helpful to the effort for that to happen.\" Trump – who contracted coronavirus\\xa0in early October, in the heat of the presidential campaign – also expressed support for vaccinations in his speech Feb. 28 at the Conservative Political Action Conference. \"So, everybody, go get your shot,\" he told the crowd of supporters. In the Fox News interview, Trump also took credit for production of the vaccines\\xa0and criticized Biden for not giving him what he believes is proper credit. He also attacked Biden over immigration and\\xa0the economy. While again protesting the election and denouncing his critics, Trump said it\\'s too early to say whether he will run again in 2024. Trump also criticized Meghan Markle over her recent criticism of the British royal family, and he scoffed at the news reports that she may be thinking of running for president. \"If that happened, I think I\\'d have an even stronger feeling toward running,\" Trump said, later adding: \"I am\\xa0not a fan of Meghan.\" '"

    "I spent much time researching different API's. Although for my first assignment i used the one from Genius.com, the limit that allowed me to take lyrics from the Genius website was very low, and meant it was taking a lot of time to actually get the data in the first place. After I attended the AI Sprint and we were introduced to Exa, I wanted to try and use their API. The free version had limits, however i got in contact with the founder who gave me a code to get the unlimited version for free. Exa does have a Beta version where you can specify the type ofwebite you want it to collect data from, however when i tried to do this just for news articles, it was erroring. \n",
    "\n",
    "I decided I wanted to look at the perception of Trump in the media over the years from when he was president to the current day, so i chose 2016-2023, and used the Exa API to collect 100 websites that had Trump in them from each of the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "After collecting the data, I tokenized it, lemmatized it, removed stop words and punctuation, made it all lowercase, and removed all non-alpha characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "I then found the most common words for each year and analysed which words were added and removed each year depending on world events, and what was going on with Trump. This included the coronavirus, Biden entering the presidential race, Fauci etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "I then looked at VAD modelling, to see if there were changes over the years and evaluated this. Although there were no significant trends in the VAD modelling, there was some change within each, which can also be attributed to different events, and therefore the context of the websites and articles that were published during that year. \n",
    "\n",
    "I then completed TF-IDF (topic frequency – inverse document frequency) which concatenated all my lists, and then made them into a matrix. From this I could have done multiple things such as clustering, topic modelling or classification. I chose to do topic modelling to see what topics were evident, for 8 topics. This gave some interesting insight, however, I initially thought there would be clustering for each year, however as elections are a repetitive cycle and certain things are discussed and talked about more frequently during specific times, it would topic model these together rather than the years. For example, in his first year of presidency there will be similarities in topics, election year as well will have similarities. There are some cases where there will be topics such as coronavirus which happened mostly all in 2020 (for the most part). \n",
    "\n",
    "I went into this assignment, and topic, thinking that public opinion would have changed dramatically, as although he was strongly polarizing when he was initially elected against Hillary Clinton in 2016, he still won the vote and therefore was popular amongst a vast group of people. With all the trials and new information coming out about him over the past few years, I would have believed that some of the VAD scores would have changed, as well as more dramatic addition and subtraction in the common words. There has been a great increase in the frequency of using the word trump. In 2016 Trump was used 1896 times, compared to 2023 where it was 2547, and a low was in 2019 where it was only used just over 1000 times. \n",
    "\n",
